i'm kate aycoff i represent the jack
jewett district
i am on the communications committee i
am on
the capital advisory committee and i'm
on the k-tech board
in 2019 there were 56.6 million
k-12 students across the country
90 percent of those are in public
schools i think public school policy
is in addition to public safety
is the most important thing local
government does and i wanted to be a
part of that
i think one of the most recent
highlights certainly is our anti-racist
policy which was developed with an
extraordinary group of our own students
staff and folks from curry
also i think reinstating a lot of the
professional development for teachers
which
after the great recession had been cut
by more than 70 percent
i think we don't do nearly enough for
our teachers
we are working on salary and it but it
cannot be solved locally alone
we really need to get state funding
restored so we can increase teacher
salaries
my background is in public health and
mental health i focused on for the past
20 plus years
and i think one of the things that i've
been very proud of
is making certain that all of our
schools have full-time
public school nurses and beefing up our
mental health
capacity if there's one thing that the
pandemic has shown us
is that we have to look at the whole
student we have to look at their social
emotional physical health or they can't
have hope at learning to the top of
their abilities so
beefing up our mental health
infrastructure one of the unsexy things
about being on the school board
is focusing on our bricks and mortar and
buses
and we have we had whittled down the
numbers of trailers that we had
students in to less than 20 and now
we're back
back over 50 and we're going to put
in four eight classroom
mobile learning cottages to accommodate
the spacing requirements
but that is also because we are
overcrowded at many of our schools
and we need to invest more in our
capital needs
i think going forward as a county
and we are one we have one of the
biggest we have the biggest
transportation system in um central
virginia
we need to start thinking about how we
can be more energy efficient maybe go
toward electric buses
how we can coordinate our transportation
needs with the rest of
the county needs as i said
the key focus i have is always on the
kids and the students
but how can we do that as responsible
players in our county
prior to the pandemic our top priority
as a school
board and our top charge to our
superintendent was
aggressively and consistently closing
the achievement gap
we have students that are
underrepresented
in ap classes or gifted class
gifted who don't take algebra at the
same rate
and we have them also over represented
in disciplinary and out of school
suspensions
we need to change that i think that's in
part
related to our anti-racism policy but
it's not the only
issue that we need to address so we need
to find
the resources teachers
and consistent focus so all of our kids
can flourish
