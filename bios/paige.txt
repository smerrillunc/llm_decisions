Graham Paige was elected on November 3, 2015 to fill the unexpired term of Eric Strucko in the Samuel Miller District. That term extends to December 31 of 2017.

Paige is well known to many residents of the district from his 24 years of service as a science teacher at Western Albemarle High School and Jack Jouett Middle School. He has been a member of several advisory boards for the school division, helping to select school principals, review long-range capital program plans and determine how schools and communities can benefit one another. He also tutors children at Yancey Elementary School, is an active participant in the work of the Piedmont Housing Alliance and on behalf of New Green Mountain Baptist Church.

Paige counts as the most helpful and enjoyable part of his campaign, the opportunity to meet with so many members of the Samuel Miller District and to talk with them about the issues in education that are at the top of their list. His focus as a Board member is to support improvements in the quality of education provided to students and providing parity among all students in the quality of education they receive, ensuring that Albemarle is able to attract, develop and maintain excellent teachers and to continue building strong partnerships between schools and the communities they serve.

A lifelong resident of the Esmont community, Paige is a graduate of Hampton University and received his masterâ€™s in education from the University of Virginia.
