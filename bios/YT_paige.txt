I'm Graham Page, chair of the Albemarle County School Board, representing Samuel Miller District, and I'm on the PEF committee for the board. Closing the achievement gap, that's something that I think our board has been united in working on for quite some time. And even though we can see some minor progress being made, it's still a whole lot that needs to be done in that vein. Even another one would be in the future, we want to probably start instituting academies within our schools. And so being able to do that too would be very important to me, having probably about at least eight or nine academies distributed across the four major high schools within the county. So another real program that I'm interested in. I am proud of being able to open the one, you know, the career center out at Center One. So opening that was an important thing. And then the progress we've also already made in our academies, there are science academy, the math and science one and the health science one. So all of those two would be good things within the county that I'm sort of pleased of as a board member that we have accomplished over the last few years. Making sure that we recognize, which we do, that a lot of ground might have been lost by some of our students, both in maybe mental health forms and also just in academic forms. Academic forms, both of them being equally important. And so just being able to sort of realize where those problems might lie and being able to sort of tackle them in some way. So our summer school program will be trying to make sure that we began working toward that. And then over the fall too, we want to make sure that we begin to try to work on those problems, making sure that any losses that our kids might have encountered, that they be sort of made up for over the next summer and the next school year. And it even possibly might have to go further than that, but at least the beginning stages within those time priorities.
