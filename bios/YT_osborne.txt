hi
i'm ellen osborne i'm the scottsville
magisterial district representative on
the albemarle county school board
and i am on the adult ed committee in
the k-tech committee
i decided to run for the school board
because
my kids came through the albemarle
county school system and had such a
great experience
when i saw a longtime member mr colazar
was retiring
i thought that this would be a great
opportunity for me
to give back to the system in which my
family
had benefited from so much
my kids had a great experience here at
stone robinson where stone robinson
and walton and monticello but i know
that that's not the case
for every family and every kid and so i
thought if there was something that i
could do
to help other families have the great
experience that my family did
that that would be an appropriate way to
give back to the community
the other thing that interested me in
being on the school board is
i work in the field of adult education
so i see what
happens how difficult it is for
individuals who don't what
don't get what they need in the public
school system um
and so that's kind of been a lesson that
i've learned over the last year and has
really
made me understand the value and
importance of what we're doing in the
public school system now
so less about the board achieving
anything
that's been impressive for me is is the
way that
some of the parents have really come
through and stepped up this past year
in light of coven 19. while it's been
you know pretty awful for everybody
i've been really touched by how some
parents have
just really wrapped their head around
being positive
and trying to find the silver lining and
having more time with their kids and
being more involved
and those parents that have really just
kept a very positive outlook
and have told us about things that they
were doing with their kids
in light of the new schooling situation
um that's been
really impressive to me um the most
impressive thing to me about this
last year have been the parents that
have stepped up and
making the best of a really difficult
situation
and the teachers too the teachers have
just really been over backwards to make
this work
and you know my experience when
my kids were in school the teachers
they really cared they weren't just
there doing a job
they really cared about my kids and i'm
i'm seeing that and i'm hearing about
that
from other parents and it's been
really rewarding as we move forward i'm
hoping that we can really take all the
lessons that we've learned this past
year in terms of using technology for
learning
and independent learning
ways of relating to each other i'm
really hoping that we can take
everything that we've learned this year
and put it to good use you know
people talk about silver linings
sometimes it's hard to see those right
now it's a little hard to see those
but i think a year from now when we're
looking back we're going to realize
hey we learned how to do that during the
pandemic and this has really benefited
us
so i'm hoping that that will be a bright
spot next year
you
