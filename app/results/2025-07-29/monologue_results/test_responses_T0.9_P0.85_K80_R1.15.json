Again, if you need any assistance with finding your class today, please report to the amphitheater and we will see you around the building today. Have a wonderful day.

        "The first day of school! It's always such an exciting time for everyone involved - teachers, administrators, students, and families alike. And I must say, as a School Board member, it's especially rewarding to see all the hard work and preparation come together to create a positive experience for all.  Firstly, I want to commend our administrative team, particularly our superintendent and building principals, who have been working tirelessly over the summer months to prepare for this momentous occasion. From ensuring that facilities are clean, safe, and well-maintained to organizing teacher training sessions and coordinating logistics for student orientation events – it truly takes a village! As we embark on this academic journey together, my primary focus is on guaranteeing a seamless transition for both returning students and those joining us for the very first time. For many new students, the prospect of entering an unfamiliar environment can evoke feelings of apprehension or nervousness. That's why it's crucial for us to prioritize their sense of belonging from Day One. To achieve this goal, I believe we should implement several initiatives: 1. **Personalized Welcome Packets**: Develop customized packets containing essential information about each student, including photos, interests, and background details. This will enable teachers and support staff to",
        "Ah, excellent question! I'm thrilled with how smoothly the first day of school went this year. It was wonderful seeing so many smiling faces, both old and new. As for ensuring new students feel welcome and supported, it's an area we've been focusing on as a district.  Firstly, I'd like to commend our administrative team on their efforts in organizing the Welcome Center at each school site. The center provides new families with essential information about our schools, including class schedules, bus routes, and extracurricular activities. We've also implemented an online registration process to make things more convenient and efficient. Another key aspect is assigning student ambassadors or \"buddies\" to help new students navigate the campus during those initial days. This not only helps them find classrooms but also introduces them to other students who can show them around and answer any questions they might have. Additionally, our teachers and staff undergo professional development training focused on creating inclusive environments and addressing diverse needs within the classroom. By doing so, we're better equipped to support students from various backgrounds and learning styles. We'll continue monitoring student feedback through surveys and focus groups to identify areas where we need improvement and implement necessary adjustments throughout the year. Ensuring every student feels welcome, heard",
        "You know I've been looking forward to this all summer long.  It's just an exciting time for kids. And I'm so excited about all of the things we have planned. First off let me say how proud I am of all of the hard work that the teachers did over the summer with their professional development days getting ready for all of these changes in the curriculum. We're going to be having a lot more emphasis on personalized learning which is something that I think is really important for each student because every child learns differently.  So I think it's going to be fantastic to see that implemented. But as far as making sure that our new students feel welcome and supported, there are several things that we'll be doing. One thing that we're starting for the very first time this year is a mentor program where our upperclassmen will be mentoring our freshmen and transfer students. They'll be helping them navigate through the high school building they'll be giving them tips about classes, extracurricular activities and sports. Another thing we're doing is setting up a designated area called the Welcome Center where parents can come if they need help or assistance and someone from administration will be there to answer any questions that they may have. So whether it's about"

      "gpt_response": "As I reflect on the first day of school this year, my initial thought is one of excitement mixed with a hint of concern. Excitement because it marks a fresh start for both returning and new students alike; an opportunity for them to grow academically, socially, and emotionally. Concern stems from recognizing that transitioning into a new environment can indeed be daunting, especially for those joining us for the very first time.\n\nTo address these concerns head-on, as a school board member, I believe it's crucial we take proactive steps to create a welcoming atmosphere. Firstly, our administration team should facilitate dedicated orientation sessions specifically designed for new students and their families. These sessions would provide valuable insight into school policies, procedures, and expectations, thereby alleviating any uncertainty they may have about navigating our campus or understanding academic requirements.\n\nSecondly, assigning each newcomer a peer buddy – preferably someone who has gone through similar experiences themselves – could greatly aid in breaking down social barriers and fostering connections within our community. This approach not only encourages friendships but also provides reassurance that there's always someone available to offer guidance when needed.\n\nLastly, ensuring teachers receive comprehensive training on cultural sensitivity and diversity awareness is essential. By doing so, educators will better understand individual backgrounds, needs,",

That's awesome. It's been really exciting this morning. I've been out to visit six schools so far. They were all in the southern part of the county. And it was just wonderful to see the students. The students really are happy to be back. A lot of activity, a lot of excitement. And so that's really been the best part of the day. My observation is that when you go around, this is just like any other first day of school. It's just some of the mitigation strategies require distances and we're all wearing masks, but this really feels the same. Having said that, I know there's been an enormous amount of work behind the scenes at the school level and really around the county to make sure that students are gonna be safe and feel safe, and that families feel good about having their children back at school. We're inundated with families and their excitement to be back in the building. Normally our open house has about 300 families that come. We're well doubled that. Six to 700 students and families entered our building. And today we are just overfilled with joy as we have 1,200 students back in our building for the first time in 17 months. This first day has been awesome. It's been a long time since I've had so many kids in my classroom so I'm just super excited to see them. The kids are respecting all of the new rules and I can tell that they're really really excited and a little nervous to be here. So I ran the freshman orientation that we had two weeks ago and the biggest takeaway for me that just made me so happy is that I asked the kids so What did you think about freshman orientation? You said, well, I'm not nervous anymore. And I said, well, that was my number one key, like the number one thing that I wanted to get out of orientation for these kids. As we tackle these first couple of days, we're just making sure the students get to the right rooms, they feel comfortable, they feel safe, they feel like this is the right environment for them. As far as mental health, we are offering one-on-one counseling. We've had families come in, we've met with parents to talk about the mitigation standards that we are putting into place to make sure everybody is prepared and that there's no surprises. All of our teachers, our principals, all the cafeteria employees, bus drivers, they have really shown through for us.

I have to say that my own impression, having visited there yesterday afternoon, it was like business as usual. I walked into every single classroom on both campuses except for one or two where they were doing some kind of activity that required them not to be interrupted, so I didn't want to interrupt them. But other than that, I went around and just sort of stuck my head in each door, and what struck me is how quickly the kids fell back into routine. And part of that has to do with, of course, this being their fourth year of going through various iterations of COVID protocols, right? They're getting pretty good at it. The staff, I thought, did an amazing job. They really had things well under control. Now I know that doesn't mean everything was perfect. There were a few glitches here and there, but nothing major that jumped out at me.  Now, one thing I would say is that it's clear that they've made a lot of changes over the summer, which I think are very positive steps forward. For example, I saw lots of hand sanitizer stations everywhere. It seems like they've added more ventilation units throughout the",
        "Thank you for asking that. I actually was fortunate enough to have visited both schools yesterday on their opening days, so I had an opportunity to see firsthand how things were going at Mountain View and also at Liberty High School as well. And let me tell you, it's quite impressive what they've done there at Mountain View. The atmosphere in general is very positive. I talked with several teachers, spoke with many students, and observed classrooms throughout the building. I must say everyone seems pretty much adapted to this new setup pretty quickly.  And from my perspective, I noticed right away that kids seem to appreciate these larger class sizes because some of them said they felt like they'd lost out last year when we did go remote or hybrid. They really value being back full-time in person and having those interactions with one another and with their instructors. I watched a couple of classes where teachers got really creative about managing space and using available resources effectively, even rearranging furniture or taking advantage of outdoor areas if needed. Some others found ways to make social distancing work inside without feeling too strict. There seemed to be a sense among all parties involved that these extra precautions are important and necessary right now, but not letting them hinder any learning. As far as I know,"

In fact, it seemed like most students had gotten quite accustomed to wearing them already – many even had customized masks reflecting their personal style or favorite sports teams!\n\nOne area where I did notice some initial hiccups was during lunchtime when we introduced our socially distanced seating arrangements in the cafeteria. Some students took a little time getting used to not being able to sit directly next to their peers, but our dedicated cafeteria staff did an excellent job guiding everyone through the process.\n\nRegarding the staff, I must commend Principal Thompson for organizing thorough training sessions prior to the start of term.

The reason is that it gives us time for deep discussions without pressure from formal actions needing to take place.

And again, it is essential that all seven members are engaged, along with Dr. Ballas and her team, to make sure everyone's voice is heard and we're working together as one cohesive unit.  One thing I might suggest - I know at times these meetings can become quite long and arduous. Would there ever be an opportunity where maybe instead of trying to tackle four or five significant items in one sitting, could we focus on just two primary areas per meeting and really drill down into each area in-depth? It may result in more frequent meetings overall but I believe doing that might ensure that we provide quality discussion and not simply give surface-level attention. I'm also curious if we've given thought to perhaps taking advantage of virtual meeting tools or even recording them. That way people who cannot attend physically might still engage virtually. This has been done in other parts of government successfully, and we should consider how technology can assist us moving forward. Another idea could be creating public comment sections both before and after closed sessions. We've received input suggesting people want their voices heard; giving them another",
        "I really appreciate this discussion because when we organized last year's workshops and meetings, I felt that they were very productive.  We came up with some good goals and objectives for ourselves and staff during those times.  I'm going to throw out two suggestions from my perspective that might help us organize these better for next year, and one is building on what I mentioned before about trying to set clear expectations. One thing that might be helpful if we have a goal setting workshop at all is, as much as possible, getting more specificity around what exactly it is that we're looking for. When we leave the room after three hours of talking about a topic, everyone should know specifically what action items or follow-up needs to happen so that people can take those away and act upon them. One other suggestion that might make sense is considering an evaluation component built into each workshop. In other words, maybe toward the end of every meeting, spend just a few minutes reflecting on whether we accomplished what we set out to accomplish in terms of those specific things we laid out at the beginning. This could be useful for both accountability purposes but also just helping us improve the process overall.

        "Thank you so much for asking me this question today, I truly believe that equity in education month is all about recognizing and celebrating diversity as well as promoting inclusive educational practices that support every student's success. It's crucially important for educators like myself to acknowledge and address systemic barriers and biases that often prevent certain groups from achieving their full potential. And I'm proud to say that my participation in the culturally responsive teaching program has been nothing short of transformative for both myself and my students.  This training helped me realize just how important it was to create an environment where every single child feels seen, heard, valued, and respected regardless of race, culture, gender identity, sexual orientation or any other aspect of who they might be. By acknowledging these differences rather than ignoring them, we can better understand each individual's unique experiences, challenges, and strengths, ultimately creating more effective learning strategies tailored specifically towards each one. In practice, what this looks like for me and my classroom includes everything from incorporating diverse texts into the curriculum to engaging with community leaders from underrepresented backgrounds, actively listening to students sharing their own stories and perspectives, building strong relationships founded on empathy and trust, and even something as seemingly simple yet powerful as using inclusive language. The impact this has had on",
        "Thank you for that very powerful question. I must admit, as an educator, it is quite an honor to discuss this topic with such passion and dedication. So let's start off with what equity means in education. To me, equity means that every student deserves equal opportunities, regardless of their race, gender, socioeconomic status or background, religion, sexual orientation, or disability. It simply means ensuring that all students have access to resources, support systems, and a learning environment that addresses individual differences and needs so they can thrive academically, socially, and emotionally. Now, there may be some who might confuse equity with equality. And while both terms seem similar, there is indeed a significant distinction between them. Equality means treating everyone the same way without considering any disparities that already exist. In contrast, equity acknowledges those disparities and seeks to address them directly through targeted actions, which ultimately leads to more inclusive classrooms where each child feels valued, heard, and respected. My experience in the culturally responsive teaching program has been nothing short of transformative. As educators, we know how critical it is to create learning spaces that foster belongingness, empathy, and mutual understanding. Through this training, I've learned to become far more mindful of my own biases and assumptions",
        "I want to begin with just a personal reflection on what this month means for me because equity is at the heart of all that we do here as educators, right? It's about ensuring that every single student walks into our doors feeling seen, heard, valued, and respected for who they are.  And so, for me, it means acknowledging that systemic barriers have existed throughout history which have led to inequities, specifically in education where there may not always have been equal opportunities provided for students based upon their race or background. So then when we talk about equity in education, we must acknowledge those historical injustices. That being said, we can take steps toward corrective action through culturally responsive instruction. For instance, my training and immersion within culturally responsive instruction have genuinely opened up new avenues for empathy and understanding for me personally. Now, in turn, my role within this community allows me to facilitate discussions around these issues and make sure every educator is trained to see kids holistically. This brings us full circle back to addressing long-standing structural inequalities that still affect us today and making real progress. With respect to my own practice, I've come to realize that truly engaging and empowering young people involves embracing multiple perspectives, fostering open communication, celebrating diversity and working"

To me, Equity in Education Month is an opportunity for us to acknowledge the systemic barriers that have historically prevented certain student groups from achieving their full potential. It's a chance for us to re-examine our policies, practices, and biases – yes, even our own unconscious ones – and make conscious decisions to create a more inclusive learning environment.\n\nNow, regarding my experience in the Culturally Responsive Teaching (CRT) program... Wow! That training completely flipped my perspective on education upside down. As someone who comes from a relatively privileged background, I never fully grasped the weight of microaggressions, implicit bias, and cultural insensitivity until participating in CRT. The program forced me to confront my own blind spots and recognize how these subtle yet pervasive issues can affect not only individual students but also entire communities.\n\nOne major takeaway from CRT was understanding the importance of representation in curriculum design. By incorporating diverse voices, histories, and perspectives, we can help",

        "Thank you for asking this timely question. As a responsible school board member, I understand that revisiting mask mandates is crucial as we navigate through this pandemic.  To make an informed decision, I'd carefully consider several key factors before deciding whether to lift or maintain the masking requirement in schools. Firstly, it's essential to consult with local health experts, pediatricians, and epidemiologists who have been closely monitoring COVID-19 cases within our district. Their guidance and input regarding current infection rates, hospitalizations, and vaccination coverage among students and staff members will significantly sway my decision-making process. Secondly, I'll examine the most recent data provided by reliable sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). It's vital to stay up-to-date on any changes in their guidelines and recommendations concerning masks in educational settings. Thirdly, it's crucial to weigh the importance of maintaining academic continuity while ensuring student safety and well-being. If there has been significant improvement in mitigation strategies, ventilation systems, social distancing measures, and contact tracing protocols, these advancements could contribute to a more favorable environment where masks might not be needed as strictly. Fourthly, parent feedback plays a critical role in shaping our decisions. Hearing",
        "So I appreciate that this topic has come up for discussion because it's been an ongoing conversation within our community about when we can lift the mask mandate or whether we should continue with it. And let me tell you my thinking process is going to be multi-factorial, so I'll just walk through how I'm considering this. One of the key aspects for me will be tracking local metrics - COVID cases per hundred thousand residents and positivity rates within the district itself. If we see those numbers trending down consistently over time, that could signal to me that it might be safe enough to start phasing out masks in certain settings. Now I'd also want to know if there were any recent changes to public health guidance from either federal or state authorities because their recommendations carry significant weight.  Another factor at play here would be looking around at neighboring districts to understand what they're doing and why. What kind of approaches have worked best elsewhere? We shouldn't reinvent the wheel; learning from peers makes sense. Fourthly,  It seems only reasonable that before making such a major change, parents get some say. They've had to navigate lots of pandemic-related adjustments already. Additionally, staff input cannot be ignored as well. Those people are dealing with our students daily",
        "Thank you for that question. I do believe it is very timely to consider this topic given where we're at with COVID-19 cases in our community and across the country. I understand there are many different perspectives on whether or not masks should continue to be required within our school setting. And as a school board member, my primary responsibility is ensuring the health and safety of all students and staff while also supporting their educational needs.  So when considering whether to lift the masking requirement, I'd look at several key factors. First and foremost, local data regarding case rates, hospitalizations, and positivity percentages will significantly inform my thinking. If those numbers have been trending downward consistently over time and our county's risk level has decreased accordingly, I could see us exploring relaxation of the mandate. Another crucial factor would be consultation with medical professionals, including our district's nursing team, along with local healthcare officials who can provide expert advice on how to balance individual freedoms with collective public health concerns. It's essential that we stay informed about any changes in guidance from the CDC, state authorities, and regional agencies responsible for coordinating responses to the pandemic.

When considering whether or not to lift the masking requirement in schools, my primary concern is always the health and well-being of our students, staff, and faculty.\n\nFirstly, I'd like to consult with local public health officials to get their expert opinion on the current transmission rates within our community and assess if it's safe enough to remove masks from our schools. It's crucial we stay informed about any changes in infection trends, hospitalization numbers, and vaccination rates among both children and adults.\n\nAnother vital factor influencing my decision-making process would be the input gathered directly from stakeholders - parents, teachers, administrators, and most importantly, our students themselves.

        "Thank you for bringing this up. I believe that the proposed community outreach program is an excellent idea because it acknowledges that there's a need to increase engagement between the district and certain segments of our community, especially those who don't regularly participate. To start, it's essential that we understand why some people might feel disconnected from the school system, whether due to lack of access, cultural barriers, language limitations, past experiences, or other reasons.  To tackle these obstacles, here are my suggestions: Firstly, we should hold meetings at various times of day and locations across different neighborhoods within our district. This could include weekend events or early morning gatherings before work hours so more working-class families have better opportunities to attend. By hosting these sessions closer to where they live, we minimize travel time and make it easier for them to join us. Secondly, translation services would be crucial if we're trying to reach non-English-speaking residents. Offering interpreters during meetings as well as making documents available in multiple languages would help break down linguistic barriers. Thirdly, advertising and promoting these events strategically is key. We could distribute flyers through schools, libraries, local businesses, and places of worship. We must use social media platforms judiciously since many individuals check their",

Here are some potential strategies I propose to achieve effective engagement: \n\nFirstly, we need to identify diverse community ambassadors who can bridge gaps between the school system and local residents. These ambassadors would facilitate open dialogues, gather feedback, and provide valuable insights into specific community concerns and needs. They could also help disseminate information about existing programs and services offered by the district, thereby increasing visibility and accessibility.\n\nSecondly, we must invest time and effort into creating multilingual materials, including pamphlets, social media posts, and website content.

One nit-nit question goes back to what was to be funded with EDEP, and I understand that that is not happening. The one question I have, though, is that they were paying about $85,000 or $87,000 to the division every year, and that had been taken back or given back under the 21 budget.

        "Thank you for asking. I appreciate it. So let me start off with saying that this year's budget process was quite challenging due to all of the uncertainties from state funding levels and so forth. But despite those challenges, we did manage to pass a balanced budget which is always our goal.  Now, as far as some successes go, one thing that stands out to me is the addition of more counselors at each high school. We were able to fund two additional counselors for each high school and we know how important student mental health is right now. And then another area where I think we really stepped up was in terms of capital improvements around the district. In terms of areas of concern, clearly, the biggest challenge continues to be the ongoing decline in enrollment that we've been experiencing over the last several years. That has an impact on revenue when you don't have the same number of students coming into the system. Another big concern I have would be the fact that we still do not have a sustainable solution for transportation costs moving forward. It seems every year we're having to dip into reserve funds to help cover transportation expenses. So finding a long-term fix there is critical. One other item that caught my attention recently was during our most recent budget review",
        "So first of all, I want to commend Dr. Ballas and his team for putting together a very comprehensive budget package this year. It was really easy to follow along and understand where we're allocating funds. And overall, I'm pleased with how we've been able to maintain a balanced budget while still addressing several key priorities.  One success is certainly the increase in funding for teacher salaries. We heard from so many educators during the listening sessions about how important it is for them to feel valued and compensated fairly for their hard work. And I believe the 3% salary increase will go a long way towards retaining top talent and keeping our teachers here in the district. I also appreciate the focus on mental health resources – $200,000 allocated towards hiring additional counselors and providing professional development opportunities for staff to support student well-being. Another area I'd highlight is our commitment to equity initiatives. Investing in programs such as Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) and expanding access to Advanced Placement courses in historically underrepresented schools demonstrates our dedication to closing achievement gaps. Now, one concern I do have revolves around the slight decrease in maintenance funding. While I understand the need for cost savings measures, I worry about potential implications down the road if we delay certain",
        "I would say one of my biggest concerns with this year's budget is we didn't make as much progress on some of those critical needs projects such as maintenance, deferred maintenance.  We did get some things done but not everything.  That still worries me about how far behind we are.  But on the other hand, when it comes to instructional materials, we were able to do quite well.  And then if you look at where we're at today, our enrollment numbers continue to increase, which speaks volumes for what we've been doing here within our district.  It also shows people want to come back into the district from homeschooling and private schools because they believe in us.  What we need to do next year and beyond, going forward in terms of budgetary matters - number one, we must stay vigilant on managing expenses.  Our class sizes right now are good.  Are they perfect? No, but they could always improve.  So again, another big area I'd love to hear more input on would be about potential for teacher raises, considering how hard these folks work day-in, day-out."

      "gpt_response": "As I delve into the current budget, I'm pleased to report several successes. Firstly, we've managed to allocate sufficient funds for staff development programs, which has led to a significant improvement in teacher morale and retention rates. Additionally, our investment in technology infrastructure upgrades has enhanced student engagement and learning outcomes. The recent expansion of our vocational training courses has also been well-received by students and local employers alike.\n\nHowever, I do harbor some concerns. One area that warrants attention is the allocation of resources for special education support services. While we've made strides in providing additional assistance to students with unique needs, I believe more can be done to ensure these students receive adequate accommodations. Furthermore, I think it's essential we revisit our transportation costs, as they continue to escalate without corresponding improvements in service quality.\n\nRegarding specific line items or initiatives, I strongly advocate for continuing our literacy intervention program, which has demonstrated remarkable results in improving reading comprehension among struggling students. Conversely, I propose reassessing our commitment to the existing after-school tutoring program, as participation numbers haven't met expectations despite substantial funding allocations. Perhaps it's time to explore alternative approaches or reallocate those resources toward other high-impact initiatives.\"",

Ms. Schmidt is going to be meeting with some of the people involved in that particular issue. We would like to incorporate that into the presentation to the board. And I just want to read one statement that I think is highly important. Tomorrow, June 19, is the oldest national celebration of the ending of slavery in the United States. On that day in 1865, A general order was read to the people of the last slave-holding state in the Union in Texas, which said in part, all slaves are now free. The order proclaimed that this action involved the absolute equality of rights between former slaves and their owners. History has sadly not agreed. Over the past 155 years, slavery's disgraceful legacy separated those rights, consistently destroying lives and families and causing incalculable damage to our nation. It is still doing those awful things today. Public schools were not established for such purposes. They were established to be the place where all children would receive equal opportunities to be safe and cared for and to learn and develop at their highest potential. We are not yet such a place. Earlier this week, Governor Northam said, slavery is not just the history of our black communities, this is everyone's shared history. Our anti-racism policy promises, quote, we are committed to establishing and sustaining an equitable community that achieves the school division's equity mission to end the predictive value of race and ensure the success of each individual student and staff member. To appropriately embrace this unity of purpose, It is imperative that our school division join the state and our country, and our county, rather, in designating June 19, Juneteenth, as a time of personal reflection and renewed commitment to racial justice and equality for all. A day that stands in tall fulfillment of the four values of our school division, to serve all of our students all of the time, to partner with members of our community, to respect all, and to achieve excellence in our relationships with all. It is appropriate to celebrate that which is the true place of public education in our communities and in our nation. And so I call upon my colleagues on the board to approve effective immediately that every June 19 will be a day of honor. a day of personal reflection and renewed commitment to equal opportunity and justice for all, and be set aside as a paid holiday for all school division employees. May I have a motion, if someone is comfortable, to approve this?

        "I have given some thought to this issue, and I must say that it's an important one because there has been so much conversation about equity and diversity, particularly over the last year. So my thinking on this is as follows: We currently observe several holidays in which we close schools and give teachers and students time off, such as Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Memorial Day, Presidents' Day, etcetera. What I propose doing would not necessarily involve closing the schools but rather incorporating into our curriculum celebrations of different cultural events throughout the year. In this case, since it's something significant historically for many people within the African American community in particular, I believe that we should mark Juneteenth somehow.  jonnoalcaro (cont'd): There could potentially be opportunities to incorporate historical content related to Juneteenth through various disciplines like social studies, English language arts, or even music and art classes. We may also offer extracurricular activities during lunch periods or after-school programs with guest speakers, performances, or presentations focused around the significance of Juneteenth. Additionally, we can encourage staff professional development, maybe through optional workshops for educators, focusing on culturally responsive teaching practices to ensure they feel comfortable discussing sensitive topics with their students.",

As part of this recognition, it could be incorporated into our social studies curriculum with educational programs or special events within schools during the week surrounding June 19th."

This would involve closing schools on that specific date or scheduling a half-day session to allow students, teachers, and staff members to participate in local celebrations and educational activities focused on African American history and culture.\n\nSecondly, I propose incorporating comprehensive lessons about Juneteenth into our curriculum across all grade levels. These lessons should delve deeper than just acknowledging the Emancipation Proclamation; they should also explore its historical context, the role of enslaved individuals, and the ongoing struggle for racial equity. By doing so, we can ensure our students gain a nuanced understanding of the holiday's importance and relevance today.\n\nThirdly, I recommend establishing partnerships between our schools and local organizations committed to preserving Black heritage. Collaborations could include hosting cultural events, inviting guest speakers, and organizing volunteer opportunities related to social justice initiatives.

For instance, I'd like to see more clarification on how we plan to secure additional funding to support the proposed sanitation protocols. \n\nAdditionally, while I understand the importance of expediency, I believe it's crucial we also take the time to engage meaningfully with teachers, parents, and the broader community to ensure everyone's voices are heard throughout this process. We need to make sure that we're not just checking boxes but genuinely addressing the needs and concerns of those who will be most impacted by these decisions.

And so as far as my understanding of the plan moving forward, based on what we've discussed here today, I believe that there were three main areas where the district needs to focus right now.  The first area deals with communication. There was obviously some confusion about when the decision was made. So that's something that we're going to work on - making sure we communicate more effectively both internally among ourselves, and then externally to the community at large. And one thing that was mentioned earlier which I agree with is setting up town halls. That could help clarify things, answer questions from parents, teachers, students, whoever wants to come and engage in conversation with us about this particular issue. And secondly, we need to discuss budget priorities because we heard clearly from many folks tonight that they feel like if we had not had all these different spending initiatives lately, maybe we wouldn't have gotten into this situation. Now I'm not saying that those aren't valuable programs or services. They absolutely are, but perhaps we can find places within the existing budget where we might make adjustments and reprioritize items to ensure",

As a board, we've been made aware of this recently, so right now we're still in the initial stages of gathering information and understanding the scope of the situation.  My understanding is that we have some short-term goals, which include providing support to those directly impacted, as well as assessing the severity of the problem and identifying its root causes. In order to accomplish these objectives, I propose the formation of a special task force composed of relevant stakeholders, including administration, teachers, students, parents, and community members. This group would work together to gather data, discuss potential solutions, and ultimately recommend a course of action to present back to us on the board. We'll need to decide what resources will be necessary to implement their suggestions effectively. Over the coming weeks, my vision is for open communication lines with regular updates provided to all parties involved, ensuring everyone stays informed throughout the entire process. This way, once we get past the immediate crisis mode, we can then focus on creating long-lasting changes that prevent similar issues from arising down the road. In conclusion, while we recognize that resolving this matter won't happen overnight, rest",

In terms of the immediate situation at hand, the district has informed us that they have already started to take steps to rectify some of those issues on an emergency basis, which includes bringing back certain personnel who had previously been cut or laid off to help alleviate some of the strain on the system.

The application window closed last week, and as of now, we're looking at having those interviews conducted next Thursday evening.  So they would come before us during one of our committee meetings, which should provide more opportunities for them to interact with all seven members instead of just an interview session between three people. This change is from how it has been done in previous years. As I'm sure some may remember, when discussing these applications, it was important that this time around we allowed any 10th grader or higher who was enrolled within the district to put their name forward if interested. We hope we can increase participation through these efforts over time. And so far, I believe that effort has borne fruit since we have received double the number of applicants compared to last year.

        "I am happy to provide an update for the student representative position that we've had on the board. I think, as some of you know, it's been quite a journey over the past year or so. We actually started this process last spring when we formed a task force with teachers, students, administrators, community members to look at whether or not we should continue having a student representative on the board, what kind of role they would play, if there were changes needed. And then from that task force came several recommendations that went through committee meetings and discussions during the fall semester.  Now, just to refresh everyone's memory briefly, one thing we did determine was that yes, we wanted to maintain the position because of its value to both the board and to the district but also, importantly, to the development of those young people who serve. They learn skills such as communication, leadership, and collaboration and get involved more deeply into governance practices. As far as other aspects, which I'm sure many folks here might remember, is about how that person gets selected. It used to be done solely by a vote among their peers within the student body across all schools. Now, though, after hearing concerns from some students themselves and considering the views expressed,",

So first let me say this is an area where I have done my research because it's so important for us as a community.  But what I believe should happen here is that we should set up certain guidelines or standards that help guide how those decisions are made and also address the concerns about overcrowding in the short term while working towards long-term solutions. To start off with, I would propose that every year during budget discussions, the administration present to the board an analysis of enrollment trends along with a list of potential sites for new facilities based upon these numbers. We need more clarity regarding available land options within the county that could accommodate new schools. That way, if a decision needs to be made to build a new facility, there won't be any last-minute scrambling around trying to find locations suitable for construction. It just makes good sense for planning purposes. The other thing that might make sense is to create some sort of ranking system when considering which areas to prioritize when making allocations for new schools. This could include factors such as current student-teacher ratios at existing facilities, projected",

As you know, one of my goals is to create more consistency across all schools in the county so students receive an equal education no matter what zip code they live in.  Firstly, any policy must prioritize student needs over other considerations. This includes ensuring that each student has access to modern facilities, technology, and resources necessary to succeed academically and personally. With our growing population, having guidelines in place would guarantee fairness, equity, and efficiency during the process of evaluating potential sites, securing funding, and overseeing construction projects. Furthermore, by outlining these criteria clearly within the policy, we can facilitate community engagement and minimize controversy surrounding school building projects in different areas of the county. By providing greater predictability around future school developments, residents can plan their families' educational futures better while knowing their tax dollars are being wisely spent. I'd propose setting up a task force composed of experts from various fields - local government, architecture, engineering, education, and parents to collaborate closely with stakeholders to develop the most effective allocation system possible.",
        "As a board, we've been discussing this topic quite extensively lately. In my opinion, it's essential that we develop a clear, fair, and transparent process for deciding how to allocate funds for building new schools.  To begin with, I believe we should first identify areas of need within the district based on factors such as population growth, demographic shifts, and current infrastructure capacity. We must also consider enrollment projections, so we're not just looking at immediate needs but anticipating future demands on our system. Next, we'll need to evaluate available resources – financial, land availability, transportation infrastructure – before finalizing a strategy for funding allocation. It might be helpful to involve local stakeholders like parents, teachers, administrators, and community leaders in these discussions, ensuring diverse perspectives guide our decision-making. It would make sense to prioritize projects strategically according to urgency and potential impact, focusing on where there is greatest demand or overcrowding issues. This prioritization could include considering site selection criteria, construction timelines, budgeting for each project phase, and contingency planning for unexpected expenses or changes. Finally, we must ensure ongoing monitoring, evaluation, and reassessment throughout the entire process. Regular updates and progress reports can help maintain transparency while keeping everyone informed about allocated funds and their corresponding outcomes"

The first celebration already had taken place, fittingly enough, at an educational institution, which was Kent State University, six years prior. Today, the influence of Black History Month enriches the curricula of schools, colleges, and universities throughout our nation, and it should lift the consciousness of all. Its theme this year is Black Family Representation, Identity, and Diversity, exploring in part the strength of Black families across the United States. We don't have to look very far to find a deep personal appreciation and insight why its theme for 2021 so resonates and is so vital to our own school community. In fact, we need look no further than Monticello High School. That's where Autumn King is a sophomore. For many years, Autumn was intrigued by an old family photo in her grandmother's house. It was of a young lady born in the latter half of the 19th century. Autumn often studied the picture, which was of a great, great, great grandmother. a photo that immediately dominated her attention every time she entered the room where it was displayed. Autumn is an outstanding young woman who finds inspiration and guidance from the story of others in life and in art, just as she does every time she becomes reacquainted with that photo and its compelling image. On the eve of Black History Month this year, with its focus on the strength of the Black family, Autumn's grandmother bestowed her with a very special gift. The photo, which has been passed down in the family for more than a century, now has been given to Autumn with the simple explanation, because I know its care will be in good hands. Autumn has written about her great, great, great grandmother, not as a class assignment, but in response to an ancestor who has reached across several generations to speak to her.

As I reflect on my own life as a white male who has been given opportunities that not everyone else has had, I have come to understand the importance of acknowledging and celebrating the history and contributions of African Americans in this country. And so let me just tell you a little bit about why I think this is significant. For too long in our society, there has been a systemic attempt to erase or diminish the stories and achievements of black people. Their histories were left out of textbooks and classrooms, their accomplishments ignored or downplayed. This erasure is a form of oppression because when we don't see ourselves reflected back at us, we can begin to feel invisible, unworthy, unimportant. But I do know what it means to walk into a room and see faces like yours looking back at you and feeling seen and heard and valued. So if that helps in some small way, then we should all celebrate those differences, honor them and learn from them. When we make space to listen, really listen, to these stories, I believe it makes all of us stronger and wiser. The celebration is also a reminder of work yet undone. We must continue pushing forward towards true",

Black History Month, celebrated annually during February, holds immense importance as we honor the rich history, achievements, and contributions made by African Americans throughout U.S. history.  Personally, I believe that understanding the historical context and acknowledging the injustices faced by black individuals plays a crucial role in fostering empathy within my own life and the lives around me. It's essential to recognize that the civil rights movement was not so long ago and still has an impact on contemporary society today. Within our local community, recognizing and celebrating this month allows us to provide opportunities for cross-cultural dialogue and education about black American culture, thereby promoting diversity appreciation and unity. As an individual who grew up with many close friends from diverse backgrounds, learning about their stories and cultural practices helped shape my perspective, encouraging acceptance, and open-mindedness. Furthermore, understanding and appreciating the accomplishments achieved through perseverance and resilience can serve as inspiration for both students and educators alike. For example, figures such as Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr., or Langston Hughes have all left indelible marks upon America’s story and show what courage and determination look like. Lastly, embracing Black History Month encourages everyone – especially those from different racial and ethnic backgrounds – to engage",

For me personally, growing up as a white woman in America has provided me with certain privileges which others do not have. This includes access to better education opportunities, jobs, housing, healthcare, etcetera. In contrast, people of color, especially black folks, face discrimination in these areas and more on a daily basis. So, my hope during this month and beyond would be for us to listen more deeply to their voices, learn from them, stand in solidarity with them, support policy changes and other efforts that promote equity, justice, and equality.

It highlights some significant concerns about the condition of our facilities, ranging from aging buildings to outdated electrical systems. As a school board member, my primary responsibility is ensuring we provide a safe and healthy environment for all students.  Firstly, let me acknowledge that addressing these issues won't come cheap. The estimated cost of repairs and upgrades exceeds $10 million over the next five years. This amount could pose challenges to our budget and may require us to explore alternative funding sources or reallocate existing resources. However, as I weigh this against the potential risks associated with neglecting our infrastructure, I believe investing in our schools now is crucial. Not only do well-maintained facilities contribute to improved student outcomes, but they also enhance overall learning experiences and support teacher morale. Before making any concrete decisions, though, I'd like to hear more input from stakeholders, including parents, teachers, and local community members.

In terms of the buildings themselves, roofs need to be replaced, HVAC systems need upgrading or replacing. The list goes on and on. Now, the cost of doing so is not insignificant either. So here's my thought process right now. We're talking about millions of dollars worth of projects here. My initial reaction was maybe we should prioritize certain things over others. Like if there's something critical that could impact student safety, then let's focus on those things first. However, upon further reflection, what struck me as important is the fact that many of these items can't wait anymore. It would seem like every year we delay means even more expense down the road.

I think this is an area where there have been some questions about accountability within the schools so it would seem to me that what this proposal does is move us towards more transparency and that is something that I believe in and I believe many of my colleagues here do as well. The issue I see with this right now is really just making sure that we get it right because when we make changes like this and we're doing things differently than we've done them before, which isn't necessarily bad, but change is always difficult, and if we don't implement it correctly then people start getting upset. So let me say upfront that I'm generally supportive of these changes. We need to take a close look at how they are implemented though because the last thing we want to happen is to roll out a new system and find ourselves having problems down the line and wondering why didn't we take the time to figure this stuff out beforehand? One potential solution might be piloting the program first with one or two grades. This way, any wrinkles could be worked out before the full rollout across all grade levels. Additionally, ensuring ongoing support training for teachers and other stakeholders during the initial year could also help smooth over any h",
        "I appreciate the opportunity to weigh in on this topic as it is an essential component of teaching and learning in our district.  Firstly, regarding the proposed changes to the school's assessment process, I believe they have been well thought out and align with the current research about best practices for student assessments. From what I've gathered so far, one key change would involve shifting from high-stakes testing at the end of each grading period towards more continuous assessments throughout each unit. This approach not only reduces test anxiety but also allows teachers to better track students' progress over time, making adjustments to instruction that truly meet their needs. Another critical aspect is incorporating more authentic forms of evaluation such as project-based tasks, presentations, or exhibitions. These types of assessments promote critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, and problem-solving skills – all highly valuable traits required for success beyond high school. Now, when it comes to ensuring successful implementation, here are some ideas: One crucial factor involves providing professional development opportunities to support our educators in adapting to these new approaches. Teachers need training on crafting meaningful assessments, interpreting data, and using technology tools effectively. Additionally, I propose establishing cross-functional teams consisting of administrators, department heads, and teacher leaders who work together closely to oversee and monitor the",
        "Thank you for that excellent question, unknownspeaker! The assessment process is always evolving as research reveals better methods of measuring student learning outcomes. I must say that after careful review, I'm intrigued by these proposed changes. To me, it appears they're aimed at providing more accurate feedback to students while reducing undue stress associated with high-stakes testing.  Before delving into implementation strategies, let's break down what resonates most with me about these proposals. By moving toward competency-based assessments and incorporating formative evaluations throughout each semester, we'll get closer to painting an authentic picture of where individual learners stand relative to course objectives. This approach acknowledges not every child learns uniformly or reaches milestones simultaneously. Now, when considering how best to implement such a shift successfully, several factors come into play: 1) Teacher Training & Support - Our educators require dedicated resources, training sessions, and coaching to adapt effectively their lesson planning around this new framework. They need guidance on creating quality formative tasks aligned with desired learning outcomes, alongside proper scaffolding techniques to facilitate deeper understanding. 2. Curriculum Alignment & Revisions - Naturally, curriculum revisions would have to mirror these adjustments. This could involve revising instructional materials and ensuring alignment across all grade levels within a subject area. Collaboration"

One notable achievement is the increase in graduation rates across all three high schools. With the efforts put forth from administrators, teachers, and students alike, we've seen a significant rise in the number of students earning their diplomas.  Another area where progress has been made is with STEM education. We have managed to secure funding for more advanced computer science courses as well as partnerships with regional businesses that provide opportunities for job shadowing and internships. It's wonderful to see these young people gain hands-on experience while exploring career options they might not have previously considered. Additionally, we were fortunate enough this spring to host an incredibly successful arts festival featuring student-created performances and exhibitions.

And part of that process is indeed trying to articulate our long-term vision not just around programming but also around finance. So there are several key things here that I want to touch upon. The first thing is sustainability. We need to create a sustainable financial model. That means thinking about ways in which we can ensure reliable revenue streams so that when we make commitments to schools or programs, they know that money will be there year after year. Now, right now, we rely primarily on grants from private foundations. And while those have been generous, they come with certain limitations. They often have specific goals tied to them, and they don't always align perfectly with what our community might identify as its top priorities. Going forward, one of the things we're looking at is building out an endowment. And that would allow us to generate income over time and invest some portion of that back into the organization itself. There could be other sources like corporate sponsorships and individual donors who may choose to contribute because they believe in what we do. But no matter where that funding comes from",
        "Our goal remains to foster an environment where educators feel empowered to design and implement cutting-edge programs that enrich student learning experiences. The key to success lies in cultivating partnerships between local businesses, philanthropic organizations, and community members who share our passion for education. By securing steady revenue streams through these collaborative efforts, the foundation can allocate resources effectively, providing vital backing to deserving instructors and students alike.",
        "Well, let me start out with I think there were some discussions about sustainability of this fund when we first started talking about it last year at this time. One of the things that was really important to us is making sure that whatever entity or organization we put together could sustain itself over time. So, one of the things that we did as part of the initial planning process was establishing an endowment for the Education Foundation.  The goal behind that endowment is that once we get up and running, it would generate enough income through interest on those investments that we wouldn't have to worry every single year about raising all the money from scratch again. In other words, if we can grow that endowment to a certain size, then what we'd like to happen eventually is that maybe 50% of our operating costs come from investment income off the endowment. And that way, we're not having to go back to local businesses and individuals every single year asking for more money. Now, along with that, another component of our overall strategy has been working closely with some very key partners within the community who've committed to supporting us both financially but also providing expertise and guidance as well. An example might be foundations such as ourselves or organizations that have historically given"

To achieve this, we need to diversify our revenue streams, ensuring that we're not overly reliant on any one source of funding. This could include establishing partnerships with local businesses, applying for grants, and exploring alternative fundraising methods such as crowdfunding or community events.\n\nIn terms of fund distribution, I envision a multi-tiered approach that addresses the unique needs of both teachers and projects. Firstly, we should allocate a significant portion of our budget towards teacher development programs, providing them with opportunities for professional growth, mentorship, and resource enhancement. This would enable educators to stay updated on best practices, incorporate innovative methodologies into their teaching styles, and ultimately enhance student outcomes.\n\nAdditionally, I propose setting aside dedicated funds for project-based initiatives that promote hands-on learning experiences, interdisciplinary collaborations, and community engagement.

I don't know if there's a waking moment that I'm not thinking about it, to be honest with you. And I respect all that, and I support a stage one opening. I don't feel like there's any reason to believe we're any safer today than we were when we went into shutdown. We're actually regularly seeing much higher numbers of new cases in our health district than we have at any point during this pandemic, especially since July 4th, and that hasn't abated. The data that Rosalyn presented also makes me feel like we're not ready to have students in our schools. Now, I appreciate the thoughtfulness that went into the stages, because I do think that that's a great way to bring students in. But right now, I don't think that we're in. We're ready to be in stage two. I also don't think that we have any reason to believe it's going to get any better in our health district. The cohort that we have with the second highest number of cases is the 20 to 29-year-old age group. And we're going to get a lot more when UVA opens. And so that's just with UVA closed. And then we're going to get a lot more of them when it opens. And we have many community members who work there. It's not just the students who are affected by that. So I'm not given to believe that there's going to be less risk than there was when we shut down. There are also, I'm still very troubled by a lot of unknowns about this disease. And all these things are not things that we, you know, are in control of. And I'm not, I'm not blaming anyone for them. I'm not saying like we had a bad plan. I'm just saying we have a good plan with different stages. And I don't think we're ready for stage two. There are a lot of unknowns about the disease. There just was a study, like someone sent me a one o'clock today about how kids carry a higher load of the virus. That's in the New York Times today from like 12 p.m. So, but we do also know that students 10 and up pass the virus along just as quickly as adults do, which is very, You know, we don't, we still don't know the long-term effects and the evidence that is mounting is not great on that. Um, I just think that if we have misgivings about bringing staff and students into the building, then we have misgivings about bringing staff and students from those communities that are more likely to experience worse outcomes from COVID. It weighs on me heavily. how we can serve those communities. I mean like, and again, I know that we all have struggled with this, but I can't vote to bring them in yet. I don't see our community with the lack of testing, with the slow testing, you know, people I know who have been exposed to it and have had no contact tracing. And again, like I'm not, I'm not here to blame anyone or cast aspersions. I'm just saying this is the reality that we're looking at. And the reality also includes great health disparities. And so for me, I don't feel comfortable bringing in people from those communities that have those, that suffer from those great health disparities. I feel like our division, like every single division across the United States for the next month has an enormous task, whichever way we go today. Our division has an enormous task of how to educate and serve all of our populations. And for me, when there are going to be quarantines or when there, and we know there are going to be, I mean, we don't have any reason to believe that there aren't. I think we will wish that we had concentrated on serving those populations now for the next month of figuring out how we do serve them than having to face those situations quickly.

Firstly, I want to acknowledge that the decision to open or close schools during the pandemic is not an easy one. We must weigh the potential risks against the benefits of in-person learning. While we understand the importance of education, we cannot ignore the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19. From what we currently know about the virus, it's clear that children can contract and transmit COVID-19, although their symptoms may be milder compared to adults. However, we also have to consider the potential long-term effects of the virus on young people, which are still largely unknown. One significant risk factor is the likelihood of transmission within schools. Our facilities are densely populated, making social distancing challenging. Furthermore, many of our students use public transportation, carpool, or walk to school, increasing the chance of exposure outside of school grounds. On the other hand, closing schools could lead to negative consequences, such as: 1. Learning gaps: Prolonged closures might exacerbate existing educational disparities, particularly among disadvantaged groups. 2. Social isolation: Schools provide essential socialization opportunities for",
        "As a school board member, I understand that this is a critical decision that affects not only the education of our students but also their health and well-being, as well as that of our staff and faculty.  Firstly, let me acknowledge that we're dealing with an unprecedented global crisis, and it's essential to approach this issue with caution and careful consideration. The risks associated with COVID-19 cannot be taken lightly, especially when it comes to children, who may not have fully developed immune systems. From my perspective, there are several key factors to weigh before making a decision about reopening schools: 1. **Health and Safety**: Our primary concern must always be the health and safety of everyone involved – students, teachers, support staff, and families. We need to ensure that our schools can provide a safe environment for all individuals, which means implementing robust measures to prevent the spread of the virus. 2. **Risks vs. Benefits**: While online learning has its limitations, we must consider whether the benefits of in-person instruction outweigh the potential risks of transmission within schools. This includes assessing the likelihood of outbreaks, the severity of illness among children, and the impact on vulnerable populations (e.g., those with compromised immune systems). 3. **Guidelines and",
        "Thank you for asking this crucial question. As a school board member, my top priority is always the health, safety, and well-being of our students, staff, and community.  To address this complex issue, I'd like to break down my thought process into several key factors: Firstly, I acknowledge that the pandemic has created unprecedented challenges for education systems worldwide. The uncertainty surrounding COVID-19's transmission rates, severity, and long-term effects makes it difficult to make definitive decisions. However, as a responsible decision-maker, I must weigh the potential risks against the benefits of reopening schools. On one hand, closing schools can have significant negative impacts on children's academic progress, social development, and mental health. Prolonged closures may also exacerbate existing inequalities, particularly among disadvantaged communities who rely heavily on schools for meals, support services, and access to resources. On the other hand, reopening schools prematurely could lead to increased transmission rates, putting vulnerable populations – such as older teachers, staff, and immunocompromised individuals – at risk of serious illness or even death. Given these considerations, I believe a cautious, data-driven approach is essential. Before making a decision, I would consult with local health authorities, medical experts, and educational stakeholders"

The pandemic has disproportionately affected vulnerable populations, including students from low-income backgrounds, those with disabilities, and English language learners. It's essential that we prioritize their well-being while balancing the need to provide quality education. \n\nI've been closely following scientific research, CDC guidelines, and expert opinions. While there are still many unknowns surrounding COVID-19, it's clear that reopening schools without proper safety measures would put our students, teachers, and staff at risk. This is particularly concerning given the already existing health disparities within our community.\n\nBefore making a decision, I believe it's crucial to weigh the potential benefits of in-person learning against the potential risks. We must consider not only the academic consequences but also the emotional toll of prolonged isolation on our children's mental health. Furthermore, I recognize that some families may rely heavily on schools for childcare or access to basic necessities like meals and healthcare services.\n\nIn light of these complexities, I propose that we take a cautious yet adaptive approach. This might involve implementing hybrid models, such as staggered schedules or blended online-offline instruction, which can help mitigate transmission risks while preserving face-to-face interaction.

Secondly, um, Where I am right now, I really urge us as a board to not look at our county as somehow immune to nationwide issues. I've gotten that feedback from a couple of folks and I recognize that we prioritize being an anti racist division and I applaud us for that. But we do still have the same stubborn outcome gaps as do other divisions. And as you saw also on the data that I sent last night, we still have the same types of issues with placing police where there are more lock and bound students. The daily progress has reported, um, that we have the same types of disproportionate minority contact and Elmore County as do other municipalities.

        "Thank you for asking this important question. As a school board member, I've had the opportunity to engage with various stakeholders, including teachers, administrators, students, and parents. Based on these interactions, my observations, and data analysis, I'd like to share my candid thoughts.  Firstly, I believe that our school division has made some strides in recent years, such as implementing new curricula and investing in professional development opportunities for staff. However, despite these efforts, there is still much work to be done, particularly when it comes to addressing systemic inequities and ensuring all students receive an equal opportunity to succeed. One major concern I have is the persistent achievement gap between white students and students of color. Our data shows that students from marginalized communities continue to lag behind their peers in terms of academic performance, graduation rates, and college readiness. This is unacceptable and demands immediate attention. Another issue I'm concerned about is the lack of diversity among our teaching staff. Research suggests that having educators who reflect the demographics of our student population can lead to better academic outcomes and increased student engagement. Unfortunately, our district's teacher demographic doesn't mirror our student body, which may contribute to cultural misunderstandings and biases. Furthermore, I worry that our disciplinary policies disproportionately",
        "Thank you for asking this important question. As a school board member, I've had the privilege of working closely with administrators, teachers, students, and community members to understand the complexities of our school division.  In my opinion, our school division has made significant strides in recent years, particularly in terms of academic achievement. We've seen improvements in graduation rates, increased access to advanced coursework, and a growing commitment to STEM education. However, despite these gains, I share many concerns regarding the persistent disparities in student outcomes, especially when it comes to racial equity. One area that troubles me is the lingering achievement gap between white students and students of color. Despite efforts to address this issue, our data still shows significant differences in reading and math proficiency levels, as well as higher suspension rates among African American and Latinx students. It's clear that we need to re-examine our strategies and intensify our focus on culturally responsive teaching practices, implicit bias training for staff, and targeted support systems for historically underserved populations. Another concern I have is the lack of diversity in our teacher workforce. Our district demographics show that our student body is increasingly diverse, yet our teaching staff does not reflect this diversity. Research suggests that having teachers who look like them can positively impact",

As a school board member, I've had the privilege of serving this community for several years now, and I must say that while we've made some progress, there's still much work to be done.  When it comes to the current state of our school division, I'm concerned about the persistent achievement gaps between different student subgroups. Our data shows that students from marginalized communities, particularly African American and Latinx students, continue to lag behind their peers in terms of academic performance, graduation rates, and college readiness. This is unacceptable, and as a board, we need to take more decisive action to address these disparities. One area where I believe we're falling short is in providing culturally responsive education. We need to ensure that our curriculum reflects the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all our students. It's essential that we provide teachers with professional development opportunities to help them better understand and appreciate the cultural nuances of their students, so they can create inclusive learning environments. Another concern I have is around teacher diversity. Our teaching staff does not reflect the demographics of our student body, which means many students lack role models who share their race or ethnicity.

Lastly, I think it's essential to conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis to determine whether the projected benefits of these changes outweigh the financial burden they may place on our already-strained budget.

As a dedicated school board member, I believe it's crucial for us to tackle the pressing concerns of improving student achievement while simultaneously addressing the pervasive issue of inequity in our educational system.  After careful consideration, I've identified four key areas that require attention: 1. **Curriculum Reforms**: We need to revise our curriculum to ensure it is inclusive, culturally responsive, and relevant to the diverse backgrounds and experiences of our students. This means incorporating more diverse texts, perspectives, and histories into our lesson plans. By doing so, we can help bridge the gap between what's taught in class and the realities faced by our students outside of school. To achieve this, I propose conducting regular reviews of our curriculum, engaging with community stakeholders, and providing professional development opportunities for teachers to learn about culturally sensitive teaching practices. 2. **Teacher Training and Support**: Teachers are the backbone of our education system, but they often lack the necessary training and resources to effectively support students from underrepresented groups. To combat this, I recommend investing in ongoing teacher professional development focused on implicit bias recognition, trauma-informed care, and differentiated instruction strategies.

As I consider this proposal to decouple the mental health component from Stage Three of our comprehensive student support program, my initial thought is that we need to carefully weigh the pros and cons.  On one hand, I understand the argument that mental health is an essential aspect of overall well-being, and separating it from the other components might allow us to give it more focused attention and resources. It's possible that this could lead to more effective interventions and better outcomes for students who struggle with mental health issues. However, as I reflect on our current program structure, I'm concerned about potential unintended consequences. By decoupling mental health from Stage Three, we risk fragmenting our approach to supporting students. We've worked hard to create a holistic framework that acknowledges the interconnectedness of academic, social-emotional, and physical needs. If we separate out mental health, we may inadvertently create silos that undermine our goal of providing comprehensive care. Before making any decisions, I'd like to see some data analysis on the impact of decoupling mental health services on student outcomes.

However, if we separate it from Stage Three, which focuses on developing social-emotional skills, we risk creating silos within our support system. My concern is that decoupling might lead to fragmented services, where mental health becomes an afterthought rather than being integrated into our comprehensive approach to student development. We want to ensure that our teachers, counselors, and administrators can address students' needs holistically, recognizing that social-emotional learning and mental health are interconnected. That being said, I understand the importance of prioritizing mental health support. Perhaps instead of decoupling, we could explore ways to enhance the mental health component within Stage Three.

However, upon further reflection, I wonder if we might inadvertently be perpetuating a reactive rather than proactive approach to supporting our students' overall mental wellness.\n\nBy separating out the mental health component, we may create an opportunity to prioritize prevention and early intervention strategies more explicitly. This could involve investing in universal supports like social-emotional learning programs, teacher training on mindfulness practices, and parent education initiatives – all aimed at fostering a culture that values mental health and reduces stigma around seeking help.\n\nIn terms of prioritization, I would propose that we allocate dedicated resources specifically towards these upstream efforts.

After careful consideration, discussion with public health experts, and review of state guidelines, our school board has decided to adopt the following resolution regarding COVID-19 vaccination policies for school employees: Firstly, we acknowledge the importance of protecting the health and safety of our students, staff, and community members during the ongoing pandemic. To achieve this goal, we have decided to strongly encourage all school employees to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Specifically, our resolution requires all school employees to either (1) provide proof of full vaccination against COVID-19 or (2) undergo weekly COVID-19 testing. This policy applies to all full-time and part-time employees, including teachers, administrators, support staff, and contractors who work directly with students.

After careful consideration of the latest data, expert guidance, and community input, the Albemarle County School Board has adopted a resolution requiring all school employees to either provide proof of full vaccination against COVID-19 or undergo regular testing as a condition of employment. Our primary concern is ensuring the health, safety, and well-being of our students, staff, and faculty. Given the ongoing pandemic and the significant risk it poses to public health, we believe this measure is necessary to minimize transmission within our schools and protect vulnerable populations. Here's how the policy works: 1. **Vaccination requirement:** All school employees must provide proof of full vaccination (two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson) by [insert specific date]. 2. **Testing alternative:** For those who cannot receive the vaccine due to medical reasons or religious exemptions, they can opt for weekly COVID-19 tests at no personal cost. 3. **Exemption process:** We've established a clear exemption process for individuals with legitimate medical contraindications or sincerely held religious beliefs.

One of its purposes was to join in commemorating and encouraging the study, observance, and celebration of the vital role women play in American history. Earlier this week, we received an advanced look at just who we will be celebrating in future years, and four of these extraordinary young women, I'm proud to say, are our students. The annual Emily Couric Leadership Forum Scholarship Awards were announced this week, and in the words of the forum, their awards are designed to encourage all women to adopt an active role in government, public issues, and policy debates affecting their communities, and to inspire young women to pursue activities that will empower them to become effective leaders. For the second consecutive year, the top award, the Emily Couric Leadership Scholarship, was earned by an Albemarle High School student, and this year she's Aditi Prakash. Aditi plans a career in education policy, especially to help bring the love of science to disadvantaged students. She will receive $35,000 toward her college education at Stanford University. The recipient of the forum's Joshua J. Scott Merit Award and a $15,000 scholarship is Rachel Field from Monticello High School. Of course, we all remember Rachel's medical research project from her appearance before us last month. Two other students received $7,000 scholarships from the forum, Mia Shiner from our charter school and Kimball Sheehan from Western Albemarle High School. Aditi and Rachel were able to join us this evening and under normal circumstances, I would ask them to join us at the podium so that we could shake their hands.

However, after reviewing the current program's structure and operations, I have identified some areas for improvement.  Firstly, I'd like to acknowledge that our current program has provided valuable opportunities for student representatives to participate in board meetings, share their perspectives, and contribute to policy discussions. Nevertheless, I've noticed that the selection process for these representatives might not be as inclusive as we would like it to be. One concern I have is that the selection committee, which comprises administrators and teachers, tends to favor students who are already involved in extracurricular activities or hold leadership positions within the school. While these students undoubtedly possess valuable skills, this bias may overlook quieter, yet equally passionate and dedicated students from diverse backgrounds. To address this issue, I propose expanding the selection criteria to include more diverse voices and experiences. For instance, we could establish an application process that allows students to self-nominate or be nominated by peers, with clear guidelines emphasizing the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusivity.

Last month, we had the wonderful opportunity to hear from Baker Butler educators about the nationally recognized gains they have made in closing the achievement gap at their school. Tonight we're focusing on yet another opportunity gap in our schools and in schools across our nation, the percentage of students of color who enter STEM related fields. 45 years ago, an organization was established to address this issue, the National Society of Black Engineers. Its mission was ambitious and vital to the collective prosperity of every community in the United States. The society was organized to promote academic excellence, provide scholarships, train leaders, and expand access to professional careers. A few years ago, the society broadened its charter to include high school chapters, and one of the first chapters in Central Virginia was established at Albemarle High School. Membership is open to students from all of our middle school and high schools, regardless of race or ethnicity. Students from Greer, Burley, and soon Walton are members and students are members, and students from UVA serve as mentors. There currently are 25 students in our local chapter, and more than 100 students have had their lives changed by this extraordinary program. Many have gone on to earn engineering degrees at the university level. The driving, guiding, determined light for these young people continues to be Ms. Pearl Early, Albemarle High School student support specialist. A characteristic of this program is its strong emphasis on project-based learning. Students learn how to research, design, experiment with, and refine solutions that can improve our lives. A natural topic this year is COVID-19, and true to form, students have come up with an ingenious approach to protecting public health. I understand that the nature of this development process is that it can take up to two years, but our students have field-tested their invention within seven months.

Firstly, let's acknowledge that the recent updates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have created some confusion around our existing mask policy. Specifically, the CDC now recommends that fully vaccinated individuals can resume activities without wearing masks or social distancing, except where required by federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations. Regarding our district's respite aspect of the mask policy, we need to clarify its implementation in light of these updated guidelines. The respite provision allows students and staff to remove their masks during certain activities, such as outdoor recess, lunchtime, or when social distancing is possible. However, we must ensure that this relaxation of masking does not compromise the safety of our unvaccinated population, including those under 12 who cannot yet receive the vaccine.

And that was typically seen, like that was mostly seen as a good thing, but with a caution that when you look at the demographics of the administrators, how completely different they are from both the teachers and classified demographics. where mostly you're seeing like 72, 73% of teachers and classified staff, 77% are women, but only 53% of the administrators are women. So the question is, okay, so who is getting nurtured and brought up into the, to be administrators? The other question is the percentage of administrators who are internal and for the information that we have, it looks like about 72% of the administrative changes that happened in that year that was captured were internal. So promotions or transfers and then the other 1828%. Just doing quick math were external and so we're a school division that is really looking to make big changes in some of the you know, inequitable outcomes that we've seen. And I, I think that it can be hard sometimes to do that with so much of internal churn of the same sort of people. So that was just a concern that was brought up. We also had good discussions about substitutes and the support that we're providing with them. And it was encouraging to see that there a part of the big HR plan. So we're very happy to see that because they're a very important part of our ecosystem as we see more and more. And then we talked about how important it is to have the experience of teachers of color, but also we were interested in knowing more about the experiences of all employees of color Um, and especially since we, as an organization have a lot of like micro climates. So, um, you know, different schools might have different, I mean, certainly they do have different climates and different experiences for people of color. Um, and then, oh, we talked about our ongoing challenges for being able to pay our teachers and classified staff.",

        "So, as we discussed the HR plan, one of the key takeaways for me was that we need to prioritize professional development opportunities for all three groups - administrators, teachers, and classified staff. It became clear that each group has unique needs and challenges that require targeted support.  For administrators, we recognized that they're often pulled in multiple directions, wearing many hats, and managing competing priorities. They need more training on effective communication, conflict resolution, and emotional intelligence to better support their teams. We also acknowledged that administrative turnover is high, so retention strategies like mentorship programs and competitive compensation packages should be explored. Regarding teachers, it's evident that they're facing burnout due to heavy workloads, lack of resources, and limited autonomy. To address this, we should focus on providing them with ongoing coaching, curriculum support, and flexible scheduling options. Additionally, we need to revisit our evaluation processes to ensure they're fair, transparent, and aligned with our district goals. As for classified staff, which includes essential roles like maintenance, transportation, and food services, we realized that these employees often feel undervalued and overlooked. To rectify this, we should provide them with more recognition, training, and career advancement opportunities. Moreover, we need to",
        "Ah-ha! Let me reflect on that for just a moment... So, during our group discussion about the HR plan, we had a very thorough conversation about how it would impact our administrators, teachers, and classified staff.  One of the key takeaways was the need for more professional development opportunities for all three groups. We recognized that our educators and support staff are the backbone of our district, and providing them with ongoing training and resources is crucial for student success. We discussed ways to enhance their skills, particularly in areas like technology integration, cultural responsiveness, and trauma-informed care. Another significant concern was ensuring competitive compensation packages for our employees. We know that attracting and retaining top talent is essential, especially considering the current teacher shortage. Our group agreed that we must review our salary scales and benefits to ensure they're aligned with industry standards and meet the needs of our staff. We also touched upon the importance of clear communication channels between administration, teachers, and classified staff. It's vital that everyone feels heard, valued, and supported in their roles. To achieve this, we explored ideas such as regular town hall meetings, anonymous feedback mechanisms, and department-specific focus groups. Additionally, we delved into the topic of workload management, particularly for our teachers",
        "Ah-ha! Our committee had a very productive discussion on the HR plan, and I'd be happy to share the key takeaways and concerns we identified.  Firstly, let me emphasize that our primary focus was on ensuring the plan aligns with our district's strategic goals and objectives. We recognize the importance of attracting, retaining, and developing top talent across all categories – administrators, teachers, and classified staff. One major takeaway is the need for more competitive salaries and benefits packages to attract high-quality candidates, particularly in areas like special education and STEM fields where there's a nationwide shortage. We discussed exploring alternative compensation models, such as performance-based incentives or student loan forgiveness programs, to make our offers more appealing. Regarding professional development opportunities, we agreed that it's essential to provide ongoing training and support for both new and veteran educators. This might involve partnerships with local universities, online platforms, or peer-to-peer mentoring programs. By investing in our staff's growth, we can improve instructional quality and student outcomes. A significant concern raised during the discussion was the lack of diversity within our administrative ranks. We acknowledged the need to actively recruit and develop diverse leadership pipelines, which would better reflect the demographics of our student population. To achieve this, we may consider"

Therefore, we advocated for increased investment in their training and capacity-building initiatives, particularly in areas such as crisis intervention, mental health awareness, and conflict resolution.\n\nOne pressing concern arose regarding staffing ratios, which currently fall short of meeting student demands, especially among special education populations.

        "Thank you for asking about this important topic. As a school board member, I believe it is essential that we prioritize the health and well-being of all members of our educational community, including students, educators, and support personnel.  To begin with, masks have been an effective tool in reducing the transmission of COVID-19. While there has been some debate around their use in schools, scientific evidence supports mandating them as one layer of protection against infection. In light of this information, I am inclined to continue supporting the requirement that both staff and students wear face coverings while indoors at school. Regarding teacher and staff testing requirements, it may be helpful to conduct regular surveillance testing among these groups given their increased exposure risk due to close contact with multiple people daily. To further mitigate risks associated with positive cases, our administration should consider implementing strict quarantine procedures and ensuring prompt notification to those who were potentially exposed. It is crucial that these efforts align with guidance from local public health authorities. kateacuffkateacuffkateacuffkateacuffkateacuffkateacuffkateacuffkateacuffkateacuffkateacuffkateacuffkateacuffkateacuffkateacuffkateacuffkateacuffkateacuffkateacuffkateac",
        "As we navigate this ongoing pandemic together, I believe it is crucial to strike a balance between ensuring the health and well-being of students, educators, and support personnel while providing quality education. Presently, our school district requires all individuals inside buildings to wear masks, with some exemptions granted under specific circumstances. We have also implemented regular surveillance testing for unvaccinated employees. Although these measures have proven effective thus far in preventing transmission within schools, they may need adjustments as new data emerges. Our administration closely monitors local infection rates, vaccination statistics, and the evolving guidance from reputable organizations like the CDC. In order to make informed decisions moving forward, it would be beneficial to engage more extensively with medical professionals, parents, teachers, and other stakeholders through open communication channels and surveys.",
        "I completely understand that everyone is eager to return to normalcy after two years of navigating the pandemic. As a School Board Member, it is my responsibility to ensure the health and well-being of both students and faculty members within our schools.  I must emphasize that we should not take the decision to lift or modify existing safety measures lightly. Since the onset of this global crisis, science has consistently demonstrated that masks significantly reduce transmission rates when used correctly.  Given this information, lifting mask mandates at present could put individuals with compromised immune systems as well as younger children who may still lack full vaccination coverage at greater risk. With regards to teacher and staff testing requirements, while I empathize with concerns about overburdening educators during these challenging times, regular surveillance testing can greatly assist us in identifying potential clusters before they spiral out of control. This proactive approach helps protect both those most vulnerable among us and ensures uninterrupted education services throughout our community. In conclusion, considering available data and ongoing public health guidance, I recommend maintaining the current mask mandate alongside continued periodic testing regimens for all personnel working closely with our student body. These safeguards are crucial in keeping our educational environments safe enough to support optimal learning experiences for every child enrolled under our care."

Therefore, I advocate for retaining mandatory masking policies until further scientific guidance suggests otherwise or local infection rates significantly decline. \n\nOn another front, routine testing for teachers and staff plays a vital role in promptly identifying potential outbreaks before they spread more broadly among our campus communities. By doing so, we can swiftly respond with targeted interventions while keeping everyone safer overall. In my view, these proactive strategies align closely with our commitment to prioritizing public health alongside academic excellence. However, as part of fostering sustainable, inclusive change, I also recognize the need for continuous reassessment based upon evolving circumstances, stakeholder feedback, and emerging best practices.

This inclusive approach ensures that multiple perspectives inform our decisions as we strive to create a more environmentally conscious learning environment.\n\nTo date, the committee has held several meetings, focusing on three primary objectives: reducing energy consumption within our facilities, implementing eco-friendly practices throughout our operations, and integrating environmental education into our curriculum.\n\nMoving forward, we plan to formalize the committee's structure by defining clear roles, responsibilities, and expectations for each member. We're also working to establish key performance indicators (KPIs) that will enable us to track our progress toward specific sustainability goals. These metrics will allow us to assess the effectiveness of our initiatives and make informed, data-driven decisions about future investments.\n\nOur ultimate goal is to empower students, staff, and the broader community to take ownership of their role in promoting environmental stewardship.

Maybe that means working more closely with social services because they may need something else. They may need other support. But, just to say, we're gonna provide the extra help and then expect every kid to take advantage of it when they go home isn't always realistic. There has to be another component to it. Another part of it could also be community service for the students themselves. If they fail the class, perhaps one way of getting caught up is doing some sort of community service.

Firstly, while the plan does provide some guidelines for safety protocols, social distancing measures, and remote learning options, I believe more needs to be done to ensure equity across all demographics within our student body. For instance, not every household has access to reliable internet or digital devices. How will we cater to those students who might fall behind due to this digital divide? Furthermore, the pandemic has disproportionately affected certain communities of color. It's crucial that our reopening strategy acknowledges this reality and provides targeted support to address potential learning loss and socio-emotional challenges faced by minority students. To begin with, we should allocate additional resources towards culturally responsive teaching practices, diversity training for staff, and counseling services tailored specifically to their unique experiences during this crisis. Regarding the existing achievement gap and racial divisions within our school system, I'm afraid this proposal doesn't go far enough to bridge them.

One of the things we have been doing over time is trying to address the compensation gap for our employees. In the last couple years, we've done salary increases. However, what we also recognize is that there's still more work to be done when it comes to making sure they're feeling supported, not only financially but also with professional development opportunities and resources. So if we were going to consider using our fund balance to support teachers in the upcoming budget, one area might be providing additional dollars towards staff compensation and benefits. This could include looking at increasing salaries again or offering other incentives such as bonuses for hard-to-fill positions or student loan forgiveness programs. We could also look at enhancing health insurance options or retirement packages to help make our benefit package even more competitive. Another way to leverage our fund balance would be investing in targeted professional development opportunities for teachers, specifically around areas like STEM education, special education, English language learner instruction, or mental health supports. This could involve working with outside partners, sending teachers to conferences, or creating",
        "Well, you know, we have been talking about this for a while now.  I mean, first of all, let me say that when we talk about using the fund balance, it's not just an opportunity to give people raises. We really do need to make sure we're making strategic investments because they can help us long-term. And I would propose - first off, if you want to consider teacher compensation.  It seems like there was this article recently saying that 50% of teachers nationally said that they were thinking of leaving their job. So clearly, pay is part of what drives these decisions. Now, at the same time, also benefits or health insurance rates continue to go up every year. We've got the retirement system issues coming down from the state level. So maybe even looking into how do we adjust our employer contribution rate or other things like that.  In addition, I'd suggest we should consider training.  Professional development opportunities always seem to be one area where we struggle with funding. But especially considering the new curriculum changes happening statewide, and I mean, they're going to need ongoing support. This way, we won't just hand them something and then walk away; but actually help them implement these curriculum shifts over",

        "SROs have become an important part of maintaining order and safety at our schools. They offer assistance during emergency situations like lockdown drills and active shooter scenarios while also providing mentorship to students through informal interactions or counseling. But there is no doubt that there can be some challenges involved with them being present on campus.  Firstly, it must be acknowledged that these officers are trained law enforcement professionals who work closely alongside administrators and teachers to create a safe learning environment. By doing so, they help prevent incidents before they escalate into serious issues. However, I understand concerns about whether having law enforcement presence could contribute to increased discipline disparities, where certain student groups face higher rates of disciplinary action compared to others. In light of this, one potential solution would be more comprehensive training for our SROs focused on cultural sensitivity and de-escalation techniques. Another idea could involve establishing clear guidelines and protocols governing when officers engage with students in a non-crisis setting, as well as requiring transparency around data collection regarding any actions taken against specific demographics. Ultimately, implementing and overseeing effective School Resource Officer programs requires ongoing evaluation and improvement. The most critical aspect lies in fostering trust between the community, educators, and those responsible for enforcing the rules.",

But we also know that some SROs lack sufficient training or cultural competence to deal with diverse student populations, which has led to some disciplinary issues. And because Black students have faced disproportionately harsher consequences than white students when interacting with SROs, we need a different approach. So, my plan would include requiring racial equity and implicit bias training as well as de-escalation techniques so all officers understand diverse student needs. Additionally, SROs must operate under clear guidelines around data collection practices. They should not collect info about immigration status. Also, they cannot arrest kids unless there is probable cause. We require more transparency and accountability within this program. Parents and educators should work together on developing these policies for the SROs. In conclusion, while providing safety measures, it's crucially important that we simultaneously protect vulnerable students from over-policing, promote fair treatment across all demographics, ensure transparency and parental involvement. This collaborative effort between stakeholders leads us towards a safer and inclusive environment for all students. Thank you!",

To answer your question, let me break down the rules and procedures for making public comments at our school board meetings: Firstly, we always set aside time on our agendas for public comment, usually towards the beginning or end of each meeting. This allows citizens to address the board on any topic related to education within our district. When it's time for public comment, those who wish to speak must come forward and sign up prior to addressing the board.  In order to ensure fairness and efficiency, each speaker is limited to three minutes to make their comments. We have found that this amount of time enables individuals to convey their thoughts without dominating the entire session. Regarding content, speakers may discuss anything relevant to education within our district. However, they should refrain from personal attacks against specific staff members, students, or other individuals affiliated with our schools. Our goal is to maintain a respectful environment where all parties feel comfortable sharing their opinions. We also request that speakers keep their comments concise and avoid repeating what others have already said during the same meeting. Furthermore",

As outlined on our district website, community members who wish to address the Board must sign up prior to the start of the meeting by submitting their name, contact information, and topic they'd like to discuss. We ask that speakers limit their remarks to three minutes or less so everyone has an opportunity to share their thoughts.  Our board policy states that comments should relate specifically to agenda items or general concerns about the operation of the schools; personal attacks or complaints against individual employees aren't permitted under any circumstances. If someone wishes to bring forward a concern about staff performance, I encourage them to follow the appropriate chain of command within the administration first. Once you've signed up, please approach the microphone when called upon and state your name before beginning your statement. Lastly, as a reminder, the Board may not engage in discussion or respond directly to comments during the meeting itself – but rest assured that we do take these perspectives into account during future deliberations. Does anyone else have questions about the process?",

Then during that part of the agenda item, they're allowed three minutes to address the board on any topic.  The only real rule is no personal attacks or insults directed towards individual employees or students. It's always been pretty informal though; maybe it should be more structured like some other boards I've seen which require written requests beforehand stating their topics, but with what you just said, perhaps there should also be time limits on how many speakers can talk about one specific issue, you know so that everyone has a chance to be heard."

        "Well, there were several reasons why I voted against increasing that ceiling last year. First and foremost was class size. When we started looking at 900 students in an elementary school, we know from research that anything above 500 is going to start impacting the quality of education for those children. And so when we go up to 900, it's just getting way too large, particularly when we're talking about the younger grades, kindergarten through second grade. That's where we need those individualized teacher-to-student ratios to really help them develop their reading skills and get off on the right foot.  Secondly, if we look at the socialization aspect, it becomes increasingly difficult as those numbers grow larger. You've got more kids trying to interact with each other; bullying can become more prevalent, behavior problems escalate. So you have to hire additional staff members just to deal with discipline issues instead of focusing on teaching. Thirdly, facilities-wise, even though these buildings might be rated for X number of people, they weren't designed to handle the sheer volume. They're overcrowded, noise levels are higher, making it harder for teachers to teach effectively and kids to learn. Now I'm not saying we never want any school to be over",
        "KateAcuff: I guess I'd like to see that information again on the numbers at each building and how they compare with what was projected when we made some changes several years ago.  But my initial concern would be just knowing how large those classrooms are getting for some grades.  And not only is it the number in the classroom but also in the entire building because there's been talk about recess time, lunchtime, all that sort of thing. So could we get that comparison data back out please? It doesn't seem like very long since we've been talking about this. I don't know if anybody has any thoughts on why enrollment is up more than expected but certainly something seems different. And maybe that goes into that discussion too, the overall trend so that we're planning accordingly. So let me hear from staff or whomever. How did we go over projection like that? What changed? The demographic study that was done, were there any updates recently? Maybe I missed them. Did the projections change or did we miss?",
        "I would like to say that when it comes down to it, the idea is always what's best for kids, right? So, looking at these numbers that were presented today, 22% growth overall in the district - if we're not careful, some of those classes could get pretty large and I know how much class size matters for kids who need extra support or English language learners. If there isn't enough room to move around the classroom itself, that might lead to behavior issues. And we also want to make sure we can provide an educationally beneficial learning environment for all students. On top of that, too many kids per teacher may mean they don't receive as individualized attention which affects their academic outcomes. That being said, maybe reviewing past ceilings does deserve consideration because those levels really did help us plan more effectively. Perhaps we can even use data from that time period as we determine whether revisiting them now makes sense. But for me personally, it boils down to one thing - doing whatever possible to ensure each student has a strong educational foundation and feels supported along the way. What do others think on this matter?"

Firstly, what is the current capacity utilization rate across all elementary schools? Are there any disparities between schools that could lead to inequitable access to resources or opportunities? We need to examine whether the increased enrollment is distributed evenly or concentrated in specific areas.\n\nAdditionally, how would adjusting the ceiling affect our teachers and staff?

        "It's certainly something that I've heard from many families in the district who have expressed interest in extending the length of their child's preschool experience because they believe it would help prepare them better for kindergarten. As a school board member, we need to consider multiple factors before making any decision.  Firstly, let's talk about feasibility. Our current infrastructure may not support longer days without significant renovations or upgrades. For example, some classrooms might lack air conditioning which could cause discomfort during extended hours especially when you're talking about younger children. So we'd have to evaluate whether the cost of renovation is feasible within our budget constraints. Regarding staffing, hiring more teachers as well as teacher assistants is necessary if we want high-quality education throughout the extended period. We cannot simply add hours onto the existing staff members' workday as burnout can result in lower quality teaching. One possible way to address this issue could be offering higher salaries, but even with an increased minimum wage, finding qualified candidates willing to commit to longer working hours might prove difficult due to market conditions and competition. Additionally, one must also examine how much academic benefits would such an extension bring, as compared to spending those additional funds elsewhere like in professional development opportunities or extracurricular activities targeting older age groups",

We instead did an RFP that delayed the process by four more months, at which time the Boys and Girls Club was concerned about retaining its funders. So they proposed reluctantly the secondary choice. I don't know if those of you who have not walked that site behind Jack Jewett, it's a sloping ditch. It's a terrible location. It can physically happen.

While both programs can be beneficial, my initial thought is that they should not necessarily be pitted against one another, but rather seen as complementary opportunities for our kids. That being said, if I had to make a decision about which one takes priority right now, I would say it should be the driver's ed program.  My main reason for this choice is safety. Driver's education provides an essential life skill for young people who want or need to get behind the wheel. By providing training and practice under supervised conditions, we can reduce the risk of accidents involving inexperienced drivers and help them become more responsible road users. On the other hand, while the Boys and Girls Club offers valuable social and recreational activities, I don't see it as directly impacting student safety in the same way that driver's ed does. Of course, there could still be alternative ways to support these kinds of extracurricular activities without sacrificing the driver's ed program entirely. Before making any final decisions, though, I would like to hear from teachers, parents, and students themselves to better understand their needs and priorities.

While both programs have value in different ways, my initial thought is that prioritizing the driver's education program might not necessarily align with the needs of all students within our diverse student body.  My first concern revolves around equity and access. The driver's education program may cater primarily to those who already possess certain socio-economic advantages or means of transportation at their disposal. Meanwhile, the Boys and Girls Club offers essential after-school support services, mentorship opportunities, and a safe space for kids from lower-income backgrounds. Secondly, when we evaluate the long-term benefits and potential outcomes of these two initiatives, I firmly believe that investing in our children's social-emotional well-being and character development through the Boys and Girls Club would yield more significant positive impacts across multiple aspects of life. Driver's ed, while crucial for mobility, has relatively narrower implications compared to the comprehensive support provided by the Boys and Girls Club. Lastly, I also worry about unintended consequences should we divert funds towards the driver's education program. As some families struggle financially, there could potentially arise situations where a subset of students gets left behind simply due to their circumstances, further widening an existing gap between socioeconomic groups"

We've been working closely with our administration team, teachers, staff, and community members to address numerous challenges.  One of our biggest accomplishments has been maintaining educational continuity for our students while ensuring their safety and well-being. To achieve this, we rapidly implemented hybrid learning models combining online instruction and face-to-face interaction at various times throughout the academic year. This allowed us to adapt to changing public health guidelines and infection rates within our area. Another accomplishment was expanding our food distribution services, addressing nutritional needs of many families who relied on schools for meal support before the pandemic. Collaborating with local organizations enabled us to provide meals even when schools were fully remote, thereby supporting not just our students but also the broader community. A third key achievement is securing essential personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies and sanitization materials for all district facilities and transportation vehicles. This investment helped minimize transmission risks among students, educators, and staff.

        "That is a very important issue. There have been a number of discussions about it recently at the district level, including an item that was presented during the last regular meeting of the school board. My general view regarding this matter is as follows: I do support our present method for dealing with those concerns. In order to bridge the gap between students who may not have had equal access or opportunities throughout their academic journey, there needs to be targeted assistance provided in addition to a focus on high-quality teaching methods within each classroom environment. One strategy could include intervention programs which can provide additional help outside the standard class schedule or small group instruction sessions led by teachers. Another area where we should emphasize is professional development so educators receive training in culturally responsive education. This enables them to better serve diverse groups of students. However,  it is essential that the data from these initiatives must also inform decision-making processes, ensuring that they indeed make meaningful differences. If something isn't working out then adjustments need to take place quickly. While evaluating this process and analyzing student outcomes, I believe we also must be open-minded about looking into other innovative strategies or ideas that may improve upon what's currently being implemented. For example, some research suggests extended day or year programming might offer significant benefits in",

It's important we acknowledge it so we can move forward to address it.  As far as addressing it through tutoring programs, extended summer sessions, and other interventions, my concern lies with tracking student data and actually seeing the outcomes and effectiveness of these initiatives.   What metrics have we set up to measure whether this extra support is yielding results?

Firstly, let's shift from a one-size-fits-all strategy to targeted interventions informed by granular, disaggregated data analysis. This will enable us to identify specific areas of need and allocate resources accordingly.\n\nSecondly, we should prioritize teacher training and coaching to enhance instructional practices, especially in culturally responsive teaching methods. By empowering educators with the tools they need to address diverse learners effectively, we'll see improved outcomes across the board.\n\nLastly, I strongly advocate for regular checkpoints and transparent communication with families about their child's performance. We must commit to transparency and collaboration by providing actionable, real-time insights that empower parents as co-educators.

        "Kate Acuff: Kate, I know that our current strategic planning cycle is up for renewal this year and there have been concerns about community engagement. So, let me tell you my thoughts on what would be important as far as improving our district's strategic plan and communication with stakeholders to make it more inclusive and participatory.  Firstly, from my perspective, one of the things that has always bothered me with our past strategic plans is they often feel like an add-on to what already exists rather than something that actually drives action within the system. To address this, our next plan should really focus on setting specific measurable goals tied to student outcomes. If those outcomes don't change then nothing else matters. The way forward could include a robust stakeholder survey or series of town halls at least once a quarter with students teachers parents staff community members and local businesses so people understand how their input contributed directly to shaping the plan. You're not going to get 100 percent participation but if the effort is genuine and transparent there'll be a greater sense of ownership across all groups involved which helps drive accountability and commitment towards achieving these goals. We've got the data. We need to share progress updates regularly because we must build trust throughout this community, particularly among historically marginalized voices",
        "Kate Acuff (kateacuff) - I believe we need to begin by asking ourselves if our current approach is serving us well or hindering us.  We should examine the goals that have been established within the context of this strategy. Have they been met and how do you know whether progress has been made towards them? Then, once again, what metrics did we put into place for evaluating those goals? The other thing that needs improvement is stakeholder engagement. How do we define our stakeholders and how do we engage them effectively throughout this entire process. What does their input look like? Is there ongoing feedback from all these different groups throughout the year so that everyone feels invested and included as opposed to simply receiving an update every six months? We also need to ask if this vision aligns with the budget that we're passing each year. Are there any disconnects between what we say we value versus where our dollars go? I think what's most important here is building trust and consistency. Once people see results and feel heard, then maybe even the perception changes about how the district operates strategically and communicates with stakeholders. But we cannot do this alone. There must be collective buy-in from staff members at various levels, parents, community leaders, students themselves"

This analysis should involve extensive stakeholder feedback mechanisms, including surveys, focus groups, town halls, and one-on-one interviews to capture the voices often unheard or underrepresented.\n\nTo foster greater transparency and accountability, I propose establishing clear key performance indicators (KPIs) tied to specific goals within the revised strategic plan. Regularly scheduled progress updates would then enable us to track successes, identify areas needing adjustment, and adapt accordingly – all while maintaining open lines of communication about what works and what doesn't.\n\nRegarding communication, I suggest implementing multi-channel approaches tailored to different stakeholder segments.

This evening, we have the privilege of celebrating the extraordinary accomplishments of three outstanding Albemarle High School students, Kat Ravichandran, Meena Amboti, and Isabel Pardue. Kat and Meena earned top honors at this year's Piedmont Regional Science Fair when they received grand awards. And Meena was also a grand prize winner in the state science fair competition. Isabel was chosen for the top Emily Kurek Leadership Forum Scholarship this spring. All three students are with us today via Zoom, and I'm going to let each of them talk about their amazing research and contributions to science, our communities, and perhaps the world's health and well-being. Let me offer those some brief descriptions. I'm sure our accomplished guests will correct me if I'm wrong. First, CATS research examined the effectiveness of quarantines and vaccines in controlling and combating the spread of infections. While this work began before the world heard of COVID-19, its importance to communities across the globe could not be more relevant than it is right now. Mina's research tackled another health problem. Worldwide, there are about 200 million people who suffer from dry macular degeneration, an eye condition that often leads to blindness. Until now, there has not been a treatment for this terrible disease. There may soon be as a result of Mina's research. She found evidence that a drug approved by the FDA to treat clinical depression I'm lost here. Oh, also protects the retina and could be a treatment for macular degeneration. Take note, both of these students are sophomores. Another student who has been active on behalf of health issues dating back to her sophomore year is Isabel, who is now a senior. She is also a Piedmont Regional Science Fair champion in her own right for her research on student mental health issues. And more recently, she started her own company. She uses a portion of the profits from her business to support Region 10 in providing students with mental health services. For her courage in overcoming her own challenges, her academic success, and her passion for helping others, Isabel received the Emily Couric Leadership Forum's Top Award for 2020, a $50,000 scholarship. I'd like to ask each of our guests to take a minute to share some of their thoughts about their research, about what they have learned, and about their future plans.

First, I want to acknowledge that navigating the pandemic was an unprecedented challenge for our school system, requiring significant collaboration among teachers, administrators, parents, healthcare professionals, local government officials, and many others.  Now, I would argue one of our biggest accomplishments lies in maintaining open communication with stakeholders throughout these difficult times. The superintendent worked closely with the school administration team, creating a centralized dashboard where we shared updates on case numbers, mitigation strategies, as well as guidance from state health authorities. One major success story was establishing and implementing layered protection measures like universal mask-wearing and social distancing, which proved vital to minimizing transmission within schools. This proactive approach allowed us to minimize outbreaks, keeping student attendance rates relatively steady. Another essential component of our strategy involved engaging volunteer medical experts who generously donated their time and expertise. These volunteers played a crucial role in advising us on best practices to safeguard both students and employees alike.

We also had strict health protocols set up on campus, such as social distancing measures, mandatory masks for all individuals entering buildings, and providing personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies for every classroom and facility. Moreover, we increased our custodial services to ensure enhanced cleaning and disinfecting throughout schools. Another accomplishment is that our district collaborated with local healthcare professionals who offered their expertise pro-bono to help guide us through these uncertain times. Their valuable input helped shape policies, address concerns, and develop reopening strategies tailored to meet regional requirements. Of course, no journey without its challenges! One significant hurdle we encountered was finding an effective means to communicate vital information to diverse groups within our community.

On one hand, having a police officer present in schools can provide an added layer of safety and security for students and staff, particularly in situations where there may be concerns about violence or threats.  However, I also acknowledge that the presence of law enforcement in schools can have unintended consequences, such as criminalizing student behavior, disproportionately affecting marginalized communities, and potentially creating a sense of fear or mistrust among students. To address these concerns, I believe it's essential to reimagine the school's relationship with the police department in a way that prioritizes community-centered approaches to safety and discipline. Here's my thought process: Firstly, we need to recognize that the primary role of schools is education, not punishment or crime prevention. Our focus should be on providing support systems that promote social-emotional learning, restorative justice, and positive behavioral interventions. This approach would encourage students to take ownership of their actions, build empathy, and develop conflict resolution skills. Secondly, if we decide to maintain a police presence in schools, it's crucial to redefine the role of the School Resource Officer (SRO). Rather than being seen as disciplinarians or",
        "Thank you for asking this important question. As a school board member, I believe it's essential to carefully consider the role of law enforcement in our schools.  Firstly, I understand that having a police officer present on campus can provide an added layer of security and support for students and staff. In some cases, School Resource Officers (SROs) have been shown to help build trust between students and law enforcement, which is crucial for fostering positive relationships and addressing safety concerns. However, I also recognize that the presence of SROs has raised valid concerns about racial disparities in discipline, over-criminalization of student behavior, and potential negative impacts on student mental health. Research suggests that students of color are disproportionately represented in arrests and referrals to law enforcement, perpetuating systemic inequities. To reimagine the school's relationship with the police department, I propose we take a multi-faceted approach: 1. **Re-evaluate the role of SROs**: We need to clearly define their responsibilities, ensuring they focus on providing support rather than solely enforcing laws. This could include mentoring programs, conflict resolution training, and crisis intervention. 2. **Implement restorative justice practices**: Instead of relying on punitive measures, we should prioritize restorative circles",

To strike a balance, I propose we consider the following: 1. **Re-evaluate the role of School Resource Officers (SROs):** Instead of focusing solely on law enforcement, SROs could be trained to serve more as mentors, mediators, and educators, helping to build positive relationships between students and law enforcement. This would require ongoing training on de-escalation techniques, cultural competence, and restorative justice practices. 2. **Clear guidelines and protocols:** Establish transparent policies outlining the roles and responsibilities of SROs, including their involvement in disciplinary actions, data collection, and communication with administrators. This would help ensure consistency and accountability across all schools within our district. 3. **Community engagement and input:** Regularly solicit feedback from students, parents,"

This could lead to increased anxiety levels, which we certainly don't want to perpetuate in our educational environment.\n\nRegarding reimaging our school's relationship with the local police department, I believe there needs to be greater transparency around their role and responsibilities while present at school grounds. Clear communication channels need to exist between administrators, faculty, students, and parents so everyone knows what they're doing here and under what circumstances. Perhaps establishing clear protocols for their intervention during disciplinary actions could alleviate concerns over unfair treatment.\n\nFurthermore, training programs focused on de",

And whereas within one business day of the governor's closure announcement, Child Nutrition Team members, under the guidance of Director Christina Pitzenberger, had organized a food distribution program. And whereas the program began with six school sites throughout the county, serving more than 1,000 meals a day to students and their siblings 18 years of old and younger. And whereas on March 23rd, The governor extended the closure of all K-12 schools in the Commonwealth through the end of the current academic year, and whereas the Child Nutrition Office continued to monitor the need among its students and all communities across the county for healthy meals and to work with the Department of Transportation in setting up additional food distribution sites, And whereas, as the result of this ongoing planning and teamwork, the office now distributes breakfast and lunches to students in 21 locations at schools and communities. And whereas, since March 17th, the Child Nutrition Office has provided more than 30,000 meals to students from all schools and locations in the county, and is continuing to evaluate the needs to further expand this service. Now therefore be it resolved that the Albemarle County School Board expresses its deep appreciation to Ms. Pitsenberger and her highly dedicated and skilled team for their invaluable support in meeting the nutritional and health needs of thousands of Albemarle County public school students and their siblings, and for doing so through such an expeditious and increasingly inclusive plan. And be it further resolved, the school board also salutes the contributions of the transportation department, its director James Foley, and his team for enabling the food distribution program to bring its services directly to the neighborhoods where students reside, thereby expanding participation in this vitally beneficial program.

        "As a school board member, I'm proud of the swift action we took to ensure that our most vulnerable students continued to receive essential nutrition during the pandemic.  Immediately following the governor's order to close schools, our administration sprang into action to address the critical need for food assistance among our students who rely on the Free and Reduced Lunch Program (FRLP). Here's what we did: Firstly, we recognized that many of these students depend on the meals provided at school as their primary source of sustenance. Therefore, we worked closely with our nutrition services team, local community partners, and government agencies to establish alternative meal distribution systems. Within days of the closure announcement, we set up Grab-and-Go meal pick-up locations throughout the county. These sites allowed families to collect breakfast and lunch packages for their children, ensuring they had access to nutritious food despite the school closures. To reach even more students, we collaborated with local food banks, non-profit organizations, and faith-based groups to provide additional resources. We also established partnerships with private companies to secure donations of fresh produce, dairy products, and other essential items. In addition, we implemented measures to facilitate seamless communication with FRLP families. Our outreach efforts included regular email updates, social media",
        "Ah-ha! As a school board member, I'm happy to share with you the steps we took to support our students who rely on the free and reduced-price meal program during the pandemic.  When Governor Northam issued the executive order to close schools in March 2020, our top priority was ensuring that our most vulnerable students continued to receive the nutrition they needed to stay healthy and focused. Here's what we did: Firstly, we recognized that many of our students depend on the meals provided at school as their primary source of nutrition. So, we worked closely with our food services team, local government agencies, and community partners to develop a plan for providing meals outside of the traditional school setting. We implemented a grab-and-go meal distribution system, where families could pick up breakfast and lunch packs at designated locations throughout the county. This allowed us to reach as many students as possible while maintaining social distancing guidelines. To ensure equity and accessibility, we identified areas with high concentrations of students eligible for free or reduced-price meals and set up meal distribution sites nearby. We also partnered with local non-profits and faith-based organizations to provide additional support and resources. Furthermore, we collaborated with our transportation department to deliver meals to rural areas and communities with limited access",
        "Ah-ha! As a school board member, I recall that we took several steps to ensure that our students who relied on the free and reduced-price meal program continued to receive the nutritional support they needed during the pandemic.  Firstly, we recognized that the closure of schools would disproportionately affect our most vulnerable students, including those who rely on the free and reduced-price meal program. Therefore, we prioritized finding ways to continue providing meals for these students. One of the first actions we took was to partner with our nutrition services team to develop a plan for distributing grab-and-go meals at various locations throughout the county. We identified central locations such as community centers, libraries, and even some of our own school buildings where families could pick up breakfast and lunch for their children. We also worked closely with local food banks and non-profit organizations to supplement our efforts. These partnerships allowed us to provide additional resources, such as grocery bags filled with staples like fruits, vegetables, and protein sources, to help families stretch their food budgets during this challenging time. Furthermore, we utilized existing transportation routes to deliver meals directly to neighborhoods and communities, ensuring that students had access to nutritious meals even if they couldn't physically come to one of our designated distribution sites.

The school board is nevertheless committed to encouraging public comment, and for this reason there will be two ways for the public to provide comment.

Second, members of the public wishing to provide public comment during the school board meeting may sign up online by 4 p.m. excuse me, I think that's different now, by 2 p.m. the day of the meeting.

        "So we have had to adapt our process, of course, due to the health concerns that everyone's well aware of with COVID-19. I'm gonna try to go through these fairly quickly because it has evolved over time but when we went virtual, one of the things that was most important is finding a way to allow people to provide public comments still. And so what we did initially when we first started doing this was to ask folks who wanted to make a comment to send an email. So if you want to give a comment, you could send us an email within two hours before the start of the school board meeting. The emails then would get compiled into a list which would then be shared out at the beginning of each board meeting. As I mentioned earlier, you can find those minutes as part of the recording on the website or you can find them attached as part of the agenda packet for any given board meeting. What happened next is once we realized that there were more people than ever wanting to participate and also feeling kind of comfortable being on video cameras, we started allowing people to sign up ahead of time via a Google form to call into a Zoom line specifically dedicated just to taking those comments. So you're able to join the Zoom line",
        "The Chair, I did that one. So before I was talking about comments from citizens. Thank you all very much for your feedback. As far as what's on our agenda today, and also because we didn't do this when we talked last week, I wanted to remind everyone again just real quick since we're back at full meetings now and people can attend virtually or in person how citizen comment works. I am happy if you want me to read it out loud but maybe you could give us one sentence that would tell us. We've had questions recently about if people sign up after midnight whether they'll get called on first. The answer is no, and so let me start over. If you wish to make an oral statement or written or both at any regular or special meeting of the School Board, please follow these procedures. Signups need to happen between 8am in the morning the day before the meeting closes until the close of business which is usually around five pm the day before the meeting starts. So the window there is big. That gets signed into a list. In order to keep things efficient and respectful towards other members who have work schedules like most of our community, speakers typically will go ahead three minutes apiece then a bell",
        "Thank you so much, Mr. Gilliland, thank you all so much for asking those questions about that.  It's been an ongoing concern I know of mine as well. And Ms. Larson brought up how we can best make sure we're giving everybody opportunities to participate when they have concerns or comments. The main thing with regards to speaking is, what was it? Was there like 11 people last week? So if anyone wants to come talk before us again because of this COVID time, I guess these would be some of the things to get straightened out to me. But let me try that again. They do ask that even though right now it looks different than normal times because of social distancing requirements, the county has put together guidelines on their webpage where someone who wants to speak at a school board meeting needs to sign up ahead of time by Friday afternoon for that following Thursday night, which is just going to allow them to plan. They'll see how many people want to come share. Then everyone comes through. If you come down here too early, we may still need to go over the limit, and then we could be able to accommodate more individuals than the usual 12 folks we can take from the regular group who did"

        "katrinacallsen  That is really important for all of us to consider, because I do know that some folks have been wondering about it. So my personal opinion on this is that standards-based learning as a philosophy is not necessarily bad. I mean, there's definitely value in trying to tie what we're teaching kids to very specific outcomes or goals, but when you actually put that into practice in terms of assigning grades based on that standard, you can sometimes end up with these weird artifacts where people might pass every single proficiency check-off for something, but then still fail a class if they didn't participate enough. And vice versa, right? You could totally tank every one of those assessments, but get good participation points. And so yeah, it does create kind of this tension between like rigor versus access, and which one is more important. So I don't think that that system serves students particularly well. I also feel personally frustrated by how many times our educators have tried to implement different systems within our district, and we've had just mixed results at best. But again, though, you want me to make an informed decision and vote responsibly. If I was going to say no, would someone please help us understand why it doesn't seem",
        "That's a fantastic question. I appreciate that because there have been a lot of questions around this.  So I'll just take one second to gather my thoughts here, but so we started this year with a brand-new grading scale for elementary schools moving from A-F letter grades down to standards-based report cards where we're trying to focus on providing more feedback on specific skills versus just giving them a grade. And then also making sure at middle school that we have the same thing, but instead they still get an ABCDF for their core classes. But the standards-based portion is a bit different than what we did last year.  So let me try to say that correctly now that I'm going through it again in my head. The number one positive is that I've talked to several teachers who really feel like it allows us to give more accurate feedback to parents and to kids because it focuses specifically on the standard rather than just saying oh she got a C or B on this project. It gives real clear ideas as far as strengths and weaknesses go. However, some of those teachers were concerned when talking to parents too, which is part of why they said it's taking up a little extra time. If it was that way before in some sense because every",

I guess my thought on the new grading system is, as a parent of two kids who were at the high school, I've seen both sides of it where we used to have the vantage point where if you got an A or a B you could get those points added up, so even though there's nothing else for other people to see you know like what did you actually earn in class versus extra credit which was a lot more important because if we went back through history, when we went from letter grades to the current numerical thing right before COVID hit, some things changed about the grading scale where all of a sudden what would have been an F became a D. And now we don't even give zeros. There was a big change in how we approached grading. Then that happened when I was first elected. The way the elementary schools were teaching was a little bit different than the middle schoolers. We didn't really talk much about whether or not we should offer tutoring services after hours.

However, as a responsible school board member, my primary concern lies in understanding its potential implications on students from diverse backgrounds and abilities.\n\nTo ensure an informed decision-making process, I would like to gather data and feedback from various stakeholders, including teachers, administrators, parents, and most importantly, students themselves. This collective input will enable us to identify potential strengths and weaknesses of the new system and make necessary adjustments before full implementation.\n\nIt's crucial to consider factors such as grade inflation or deflation, potential biases in assessment tools, and the emotional toll of significant changes on our students' mental health and well-being. By engaging in open and respectful dialogue, we can develop a nuanced understanding of how this change might influence students' motivation, self-esteem, and ultimately, their overall educational experience.\n\nAs someone focused on community-centered solutions, I am eager to collaborate with educators, families, and local authorities to create a",

But I get now that that percent over there is, I'm going to have to think about this. Let me talk about my bigger point, which is that I can appreciate that this is a difficult area to make progress in. I was reading articles about how divisions across Virginia are struggling to improve their diversity hires.

        "Thank you so much for that question. I'm going to say, I was actually just talking about this with Dr.  Ragland earlier today because we were discussing how we can increase opportunities for people who come from underrepresented backgrounds to apply to our district, to interview, and ultimately get hired. So right now, one of the things I appreciate is that HR does do targeted recruitment efforts at historically black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, et cetera. But even though we have those targeted recruitment efforts in place, it seems like we're still having difficulty attracting candidates. One thing I've been thinking about lately - there's some research around implicit bias training that shows when job postings include language that tends to attract male or white applicants, which means they might not appeal as well to other groups. And what if we're missing out on fantastic teachers because our job descriptions aren't written in ways that speak to them directly? What if we rewrote all of our job postings to focus more on equity and inclusion, and less on the way things have always been done in education? Then maybe that could help us get more diverse pool of candidates applying. Another issue I see is retention, because we know retaining staff once we hire them is half",
        "So I appreciate that we're having this conversation because it is an area of concern. The district has put forth some efforts around recruitment and retention of diverse teachers and staff, but if we look at the data from last year, I mean, we still have a lot of work to do. It's one thing to get people in the door; it's another to keep them here long-term. So, there are two different parts to that equation. One is bringing in new folks, and then it's making sure they feel welcome and supported enough to stay. In terms of attracting talent, I know that Dr. Ziegler was mentioning maybe some partnerships with historically black colleges or universities. I would love to see us explore those kinds of opportunities further, whether it's internships, fellowships, all sorts of ways where we can create pipelines into our system for students who are studying education right now. Because it seems like when you grow up seeing yourself represented in educators, you're more likely to want to become one. And so let's start even earlier than just hiring teachers. Let's try to build the pipeline that way. What else could we offer? Sign-on bonuses? Forgiveness programs for student loans? There may need to be other",
        "So I know we have been actively trying to increase diversity within staff over the years and doing different things like targeted recruitment. So that is one thing where it was really about focusing on going out to HBCUs, as an example of historically black colleges or universities, making sure that when they had job fairs we were there talking with those students. And then also targeting some other minority serving institutions so being at their career fairs and really just getting ourselves seen in front of people who would be qualified but maybe not be applying otherwise. That's something I want to hear if this is still happening because my sense is it may not be, but it sounds good. We should probably hear from HR about whether we're continuing that work or whether it fell off during COVID, or whatever reason it might've fallen off. What else can we do to try to hire more diverse candidates, which includes race and gender? Like how do we get these people here and keep them, which goes back to retention and pay issues, right? So if we offer competitive pay rates that match up with the rest of Loudoun County Public Schools, even if our neighboring districts, we can't compete with some of these larger schools. But just making sure that we have very"

As a school board member committed to transparency and accountability, I'd like to acknowledge that while we've made some strides in diversifying our staff, there is still much work to be done. \n\nCurrently, our district employs various strategies aimed at attracting diverse candidates, such as partnering with historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), attending job fairs focused on underrepresented groups, and offering competitive salaries and benefits packages. These initiatives have yielded some positive results; however, it's clear from our recent hiring data that they're not sufficient to drive meaningful progress.\n\nTo accelerate change, I believe we need to take a closer look at our recruitment processes and eliminate any biases or barriers that may inadvertently discourage qualified minority applicants from applying or advancing through the pipeline. This could involve implicit bias training for all members of the hiring team, ensuring that our job descriptions and advertisements are free from language that might deter certain demographics, and implementing blind hiring practices where possible.\n\nAdditionally, we should consider incentivizing referrals from existing employees who come from underrepresented backgrounds, as research suggests these referrals often lead to higher-quality candidates.

So, let's look at what we do, right, if you want like a model of what we should do in schools. We are not going to say, \"Oh, well, everyone else does,\" you know? That doesn't cut it with me, either. Like, why would you make sure someone is wearing a hard hat? Because it reduces risk; no matter what industry it is. You guys alluded to it, and then Mr. Thomas got up there and said something similar. If one more kid stays home from school because they had exposure at school instead of staying away because their family members tested positive",
        "Thank you so much for asking that question. So first of all, I guess my opinion is that we need to make sure that we're doing everything possible to keep both students and staff safe when they come into buildings.  And as far as teacher vaccinations go, there's been some interesting data lately about how those have gone. You know, it seems like somewhere around two thirds of teachers who had access to vaccines took them, which is really great news because that definitely helps reduce transmission in schools if people aren't getting sick themselves. But of course, not everyone has had access yet or can get vaccinated, and so we still do want to take precautions. As far as mask wearing goes, especially among unvaccinated individuals but also just kind of generally speaking within our school community, there's good evidence that shows it does help reduce transmission, particularly with airborne viruses like COVID-19. Now, there may be certain situations where it could be hard for kids to hear their teachers when masks were being worn, so maybe you would need extra accommodations in place to deal with something like hearing impaired kids, maybe having some more visual aids out in front of the room or even investing in masks that are specifically designed for educators that allow their lips to move",

So my first thought is just general appreciation for all of the comments we received about wearing masks in classrooms or not, whether it's from parents or students themselves, because they're all very valid concerns. And so thank you all for taking time out of your day to do this comment period with us. To start off right now, there are 20% unvaccinated people in Chesterfield County based on what was shared last week at school, which means there are still people who are vulnerable. There's going to come a point where we can talk about removing these restrictions when our vaccinations get up higher than what they currently are, but while we sit here today, we've got still almost a fifth of Chesterfield county citizens that don't have an opportunity to take advantage of vaccine if they were interested in doing so. The number one concern I hear constantly as a board member is student safety, student welfare. As long as the CDC recommends masking indoors when there are community transmissions occurring, as long as VDH recommends indoor mask-wearing for schools, I am going to stand behind their scientific expertise. I know they didn't say we needed to remove them yet, so"

Furthermore, some individuals might possess compromised immune systems, making them more susceptible to severe illness even if they've received vaccinations. \n\nIn light of these factors, mandating mask-wearing for teachers could serve as an additional layer of protection against transmission, thereby promoting a safer learning environment for everyone involved. This approach aligns with my focus on prioritizing open communication, democratic decision-making processes, and putting the needs of the community at large above individual interests. \n\nHowever, before implementing any policy changes, I would like to consult further with relevant stakeholders – including educators, parents, medical professionals, and administrative personnel – ensuring that all voices are heard and valued throughout the process.

And I think we wrote it into our school board evaluation that we would do better metrics. And I feel like this will meet it.

        "I can definitely speak to that, because one of my first committee assignments was to work on revamping or looking at what we're doing with communication. And I do want to say when I came onto this board, there were some pretty valid criticisms about transparency from us as a board and just making sure that information is getting out to parents. So we really made an effort as a whole board team to figure out ways we could get better at that. One thing we did was to move toward more consistent messaging across all platforms so that everyone's hearing the same story. And then we looked at having the right messages going to different groups. You know, you got PTOs who have specific concerns, staff have their own set of issues they care deeply about, and even students, like, they've had their voice, but how are we actually talking back? What kind of platform are we giving them for those ideas they might have to make schools better. We have been able to implement town halls which I believe have brought voices to light and I mean these last few meetings have shown me personally people still find value within those and wanting opportunities to engage. And then another big win, I would say,  especially since being virtual due to health safety protocols",
        "Thank you for that, Mr. Williams. It's one of those things I wish we could take more time to talk about at length because I really do believe when it comes down to it, you know, as educators, we all have great intentions behind what we're doing with regards to education policy, but sometimes the way it's perceived or received is very different than maybe even intended. And so I truly believe that communication and transparency is key in building trust within our community and engaging them. I remember first being elected onto this school board in 2016, feeling like there was just an immense amount of distrust from our parents and community members towards us. They felt that they didn't feel heard, and rightfully so. So when I came into office, one thing that I made a big push for was implementing some changes to make sure that we were increasing opportunities for public comment during meetings, creating town hall sessions where people could come out and ask questions directly to the board without needing to get up here and speak in three minutes, providing summaries after each meeting in layman terms, explaining actions taken. These kinds of efforts allowed individuals who may not necessarily want to delve through minutes to understand what happened, which I've been guilty of too, right",
        "So I guess what's interesting is that when we first started talking about community engagement, I mean, we didn't really have one per se. And so for me, this was an area where we saw that there were just some glaring gaps in terms of you know, communication. The way people felt informed or not informed about stuff that's happening at schools. So like two things that come to mind real quick are like one being that people would call us, they'd say \"How did this happen? How did we get here?\". You know, those kinds of questions. Or then on the flip side, you had folks who knew everything. Like every little thing because they're super engaged. But then you got all these other parents who said \"I don't even know when my kid's spring break is.\" So there was a lot of kind of anecdotal feedback around that whole piece of it.  So from there, we worked with a committee, which was made up of staff members, teachers, administrators, but also students and parents. We did surveys. We did focus groups. There was lots of research done. I went through it. It's sitting on my shelf somewhere. There's tons of data behind why we ended up"

Over the years, we've made concerted efforts to foster an environment of open dialogue and inclusive participation.\n\nInitially, our approach focused primarily on traditional town hall meetings and written surveys. While these methods allowed us to gather valuable feedback, they had limitations in terms of reach and representation. We recognized that certain segments of our community were being underserved or overlooked altogether.\n\nTo address this gap, we began exploring innovative strategies aimed at increasing accessibility and encouraging broader participation. This led to the implementation of online forums, virtual town halls, and multilingual communication channels. These adaptations have significantly expanded our outreach capabilities, enabling more diverse voices to be heard.\n\nOne notable example is our recent partnership with local community organizations, which enabled us to engage directly with underrepresented groups. By doing so, we gained a deeper understanding of their unique concerns and aspirations for our schools.\n\nMoving forward, I envision continued refinement of our community engagement strategy, centered around ensuring equal opportunities for all stakeholders to contribute meaningfully.

I had the privilege of doing a school tour this morning with Miss Acuff, and then I went at Meriwether Lewis, and then I followed that up with a tour at Burley, and I wanted to put it out there as a reminder to all the board members that we have the sign-up sheet for school tours and school visits that we're trying to get implemented with the hope that we can have it aligned with our evaluation metric, which was Each school board member setting a goal of visiting at least three schools during the school year. I have a personal goal of doing two. I learned a lot. It was really helpful to get back in schools. I'm just going to publicly admit it. I said it to the principal, so I owned it, but I had visited Burley before and I barely remembered it going up, even though that's where my own kids will be attending. So even if you've visited a school in the last four years, it's helpful to go back and get to talk to people. And so I just wanted to put that plug out there and say that I think it's been going great. Kate's done visits. Graham, I think, spoke about having a great visit. Jono, they mentioned you're going to be there tomorrow. I was like, maybe I should have scheduled it on the same day he was coming so you didn't have to do two visits back to back, but they're looking forward to having you. So that's all for my announcement. And then I will go ahead and do, we have two people signed up for public comment. So I will start by reading the public comment guidelines. Bear with me as I pull up my various documents. Okay, the school board invites and actively seeks the public's input in the matters relevant to school board governance and provides for time during its business meetings to hear from Albemarle County residents and community members. As authorized by ordinance of the County of Albemarle, the school board will hold its meetings electronically during the pandemic The school board is nevertheless committed to encouraging public comments despite its need to meet on a virtual basis. For this reason, there will be two ways for the public to provide comment. First, as always, written comments can be submitted to the school board clerk prior to the start of the meeting and will be given to all school board members for review. You can also email directly to school board members individually or as a group. And then second, as long as the school board holds its meetings electronically, members of the public wishing to provide public comment during the meeting may sign up online by 2 p.m. the day of the meeting. I will go ahead and announce the two speakers. We only have two of them. When it's their turn, they will each have three minutes to speak. I will try to notify you when you reach the two minute mark. It's just me holding up a finger saying you have one minute left. So please be cognizant of your time. Speakers during the meeting or those submitting written comments should state their name and address or magisterial district. Further speakers should limit comments to those matters that are relevant to school board governments or the operations of the school division. And lastly, although the school board will not respond to comments made during the public comment period, school board members may address comments at the end of the meeting agenda under other business. Those are the guidelines. The two speakers that we have are going to be Sarah Harris and Scott Hugenheimer. So Ms. Harris, I see you on.",

So I reached out to him, asking kind of what the status of that project was. He told me there hadn't been any updates since 2019, which was part of why I wanted to discuss it here tonight, but he also mentioned that he didn't know if anything else could happen anytime soon given how short-staffed IT has been.

One is just looking at it right now, there's no clear way to sort or filter by race, gender, ethnicity, which is really important because if we're trying to look at how we can support those subgroups, I need to be able to easily identify where they are falling behind. We know we've got a huge issue with achievement gap. That's something I'd like to see going forward. Another thing I noticed, though, when you start looking deeper into those numbers - so I don't know, one number jumped out to me last night as I was going through this real quick. The only cohort from 2018-19 to 2021 saw any growth, period, full stop, regardless of subject area, whether that was math or reading, were Asian students. Every other group fell.

But from what I can tell with data now is that these assessments which were very helpful for teachers to identify strengths and weaknesses per child had no bearing on report cards or grading, so they didn't really have any accountability measures associated with them. So while some people might argue that tests should be taken away because of anxiety around test taking if there aren't stakes attached then kids may not take it seriously, because right now those scores don't count towards anything. And then you could say well why even give them? If they are going to continue giving them then I would want there to be something done to make sure students understand their value, maybe incentives for doing better than they did last time.

That's hard to hear. It's hard to hear that only 1% of economically disadvantaged students are taking the SAT after all the effort that we put in. It's hard to hear that even the progress that we showed, you know, we touted our SAT scores, and then later we say no economically disadvantaged student took it.

So, and that's not, and it's hard to say, because I know and value all the work that you guys do, and I know how hard we're doing it. I just, I guess, want to say here that we aren't hitting the mark. This isn't it. It's not it to say that we've got a 1% increase after five years of focus.

        "I would say that first of all, we need to acknowledge that there's definitely been an improvement over time but not nearly enough because, still, when it comes down to it, those gaps persist between groups for kids who have economic resources or don't. And then if you break it further down into subgroups, you're seeing even more stark differences. So, I mean, I've heard like some people try to give themselves pats on the back about progress, but I'm going to tell you, as someone who has worked with so many families who fall under this category, you know, we can see where things might look better overall. But again, it doesn't matter how high up my kid climbs on their own mountain if everyone else around them is starting at a much higher elevation and climbing at a faster rate than they ever could, right? There needs to be an emergency sense of urgency here because these aren't just test scores; we're talking about opportunities. We're talking about doors being open or closed based off one thing alone. And then there's also, oh yeah, let me add on, college-readiness levels. If these kids are struggling to pass this one exam - and please keep in mind there are different factors",
        "Thank you for asking that question. The progress we've made I would say has been slow, but it's steady. We have seen an increase over the years. So like I said, last year was about 54 percent. So to get up from where we were before that at around 40ish percent, that does take effort and work, right? That takes effort from not only teachers but also administration, counselors, all hands on deck. But when you look at some of those numbers, still 54 percent as great as that might sound, which it should sound good because that means more kids taking it, right? It doesn't necessarily mean they're going to go off to college just yet. And then looking even further into that data there's some schools with much lower rates than others within the county, so if I want to really kind of pinpoint places where we need improvement, that's one area too because it's access. We don't charge any student fees anymore.",
        "I'm gonna start with the second part first.  The reason that it's so urgent for me to address economic disadvantage student performance when it comes to standardized tests like the SAT has everything to do with opportunity gap. I don't know if everyone knows this but about two years ago there was an article that came out from UVa that said basically because of the way we're doing education right now in Virginia, we can pretty much predict at birth who's going to get a college degree based on income levels. That just blew my mind because I had no idea. So these kids are already behind the eight ball before they even show up at kindergarten. And then we know that if we look at their life outcomes. If you graduate from high school, you earn more money than someone who doesn't. But let's say you get that four-year degree, which is getting harder and harder for those kids who aren't prepared because they have to take remedial courses. You make significantly more money, and that changes not only your own trajectory but also your family's trajectory as well. We know that people living under poverty lines tend to stay in intergenerational poverty, and if you can break through one generation that makes all the difference in the world."

So one idea would be maybe going towards electric buses because I've seen some other counties doing that and it seems like something that could work out well for us. Another thing that might be worth considering down the line or looking into could be whether any new buildings that we put up should have green roofs just so they'd get those environmental benefits, and what kinds of ways can we encourage kids to walk or bike when possible.

        "That's a really important question. Thank you for asking it. So I'm glad to share my thoughts on that.  So first of all, we know that attracting and retaining high-quality teachers is essential for student success. And we also know that one major factor in being able to attract and retain those high-quality teachers is fair compensation.  Right now, teacher salaries in Virginia rank 34th in the nation when adjusted for cost of living.  And let me just say, that's not acceptable. It's not acceptable because we need to compete with other states and even private industries to get these highly qualified educators into our classrooms. When we fail to invest in them, they go somewhere else where they can earn more money doing the same job or taking their skills elsewhere, which ultimately hurts our students and our community at large. Now, we've seen some progress recently. There was a big push last year from General Assembly members as well as advocacy groups like the VEA and so forth pushing for increased funding for teacher raises. We did see some significant increases in the budget this past session. However, we still have a long way to go before we reach anything close to what would be considered competitive. And again, it's not just about",
        "Thank you so much for that question. I appreciate you asking about this incredibly important topic because as we all know, compensation for teachers is an issue that has been plaguing us here in the commonwealth for years.  To me, to say that it's just a concern would probably be understating it quite frankly, right?  When looking at data from the National Education Association, we see that Virginia currently ranks around 16th in terms of average teacher salary out of 50 states. This may seem somewhat respectable initially, but if we factor inflation into these numbers, which unfortunately gets very real when discussing budgets, Virginia falls closer to 35th place nationally.  You can't even begin to imagine how demoralizing that must feel when seeing other professionals with similar educational requirements and work ethic being compensated more significantly elsewhere, all while knowing the role teachers play in shaping young minds - that responsibility alone should demand some level of commensurate compensation. So now let's tie this directly back into its impact on the quality of education in Virginia. First off, higher salaries attract better talent; we have a harder time recruiting the best educators because they often look towards neighboring jurisdictions offering higher starting points or better cost-of-living adjustments. It only makes",
        "I am very much aware that currently we're ranked 34th nationally when it comes to teacher pay, which is unacceptable for us because we know that teachers are essential. They are really at the heart of everything else we do here.  So as far as what I would like to see happen, number one, obviously, would be increased funding from Richmond so that our teachers can make a competitive wage relative to other states, but also just period, end of story, they deserve to have a living wage.  And then two, we should work towards a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) every year instead of this piecemeal approach where sometimes there's an increase and sometimes there isn't. In terms of what effect it has on quality of education, it's pretty straightforward. When you don't offer competitive wages, you don't attract top talent or retain them over time. That means students suffer, because their best chance of success happens when they've got great instructors standing up front teaching them every single day. But secondly, you could even make the argument that it hurts the economy long-term if you're not producing educated workers who can go out into the world and get high-paying jobs because that's going to affect local"

As a school board member committed to transparency and accountability, I believe it's essential to acknowledge that Virginia ranks 34th nationally in terms of average teacher salary. This is concerning because competitive compensation plays a significant role in attracting and retaining top teaching talent.\n\nResearch has consistently shown that teacher quality is one of the most influential factors impacting student outcomes. When teachers feel undervalued and undercompensated, they may seek opportunities elsewhere or leave the profession altogether. This can lead to disruptions in continuity and consistency, ultimately affecting the overall quality of education.\n\nI'm particularly concerned about the potential impact on underserved communities, where students already face additional barriers to academic success. It's crucial we address these disparities to ensure equitable access to high-quality educators.\n\nTo improve the situation, I propose exploring cost-of-living adjustments, performance-based incentives, and alternative certification pathways to attract more candidates into the profession.

So my understanding is that there's some differences between different bills that have been proposed, but the concept of having student loan forgiveness or repayment assistance for teachers could definitely make an impact here. It can make our teaching profession more competitive when we're trying to get folks into this field and retain them. And so what would help me would be getting some data on where are the schools that need these incentives most, whether it might not just necessarily be the same places that have had difficulty staffing or if they've also got other challenges going on too like poverty rates et cetera. One thing that does concern me though is, if all we do is offer loan forgiveness without increasing base pay, I feel like we're taking care of one part of the equation but we're leaving another part out, right. We're still gonna have issues with teacher burnout and potentially even bigger turnover.

One thing I would say is that one way we have not been doing well for teachers at least recently - again, this was something brought up during my campaign when people were talking about how much they had to pay out of pocket for supplies. We have seen some pretty significant changes. But I don't know if you guys recall like five years ago, we passed that budget that put more funding into schools but also took away the authority from local districts to increase property taxes without going back to voters. And so it has meant that even though there's been some increases in salary, because the cost of living goes up every year, those gains haven't necessarily kept pace with inflation. That being said, part of what makes me excited about having a new governor is he did talk about wanting to look at increasing education spending by $500 million, which would likely go towards things like salaries and other resources that schools need. On the topic of teacher loan forgiveness specifically, I mean, in an ideal world, I do believe that teaching should be a job where you're paid enough to afford",
        "Teacher loan forgiveness, that's something I have spoken about before. So, my personal thought is that we should provide more support for it, especially when you look at how high interest rates can get with student loans. I know people who have graduated from college and their payments are astronomical. And if there was a way where the state could help them out or incentivize folks to stay within the teaching profession, particularly those who work in underserved areas. One example is like an area of poverty or special needs classrooms, things like that, because I do believe that teachers deserve higher salaries as well, so what would happen if we were able to offer some form of loan forgiveness if someone stayed in the system after five years or 10 years, say. But also increase their salary because I mean right now I think we're looking at a $35,000 starting rate here, which is low compared to surrounding states, which makes me want to know why teachers don't choose us over somewhere else. You see how long this conversation could go? What I'll say though is even though this doesn't necessarily fall into the category of teacher comp, that kind of thing could actually make them feel better compensated and valued.

As a school board member committed to transparency and accountability, I believe it's crucial to examine the relationship between teacher loan forgiveness programs, compensation, and equity.\n\nFirstly, teacher loan forgiveness programs can serve as an attractive incentive to recruit and retain talented educators, particularly in high-needs areas or subjects like special education, math, and science. By alleviating some of the financial burdens associated with student loans, we can make the teaching profession more appealing and sustainable.\n\nHowever, it's equally important to consider these programs within the broader context of teacher compensation and equity. In my opinion, loan forgiveness initiatives should supplement rather than replace fair and competitive salaries for our educators. We must ensure that teachers receive adequate compensation for their hard work and dedication, regardless of whether they participate in forgiveness programs.\n\nRegarding equity, it's vital to recognize that certain demographics may face disproportionate barriers when accessing these programs. For instance, teachers from underrepresented groups might have accumulated more debt due to systemic inequalities. Therefore, any loan forgiveness program should prioritize support for these individuals and provide targeted resources to address existing disparities.\n\nUltimately, as a school board member focused on community-centered",

        "Thank you for that question. So I just wanted to clarify, I believe last year there was an incident where someone wore a shirt with some imagery to one of our high schools, which really caused quite a bit of concern among students and staff. In terms of our district policies, we do have 5024, which deals with student conduct, and part of that says that if it causes a disruption to the educational environment, then the administration has authority to ask students not to wear something. We also have Policy 1300, which is about equal opportunity education, which explicitly states that no student shall be discriminated against based on race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, or disability. The question becomes how does this relate back to the Confederate flag. From my research, there isn't necessarily anything within those two specific policies, at least from what I found, that would specifically address Confederate flags. But the spirit of these policies speaks directly towards making sure all students feel welcome and included. It seems like most people don't understand why you can't wear swastikas. That comparison has been made before, but I guess my thing would be they're both symbols that evoke feelings of hatred, fear, pain. One could",
        "Thank you for bringing this up because it is an important topic. I have to start out by saying that our policies currently state we cannot use or wear anything with racist language, symbolism, or actions. And when I say \"currently,\"  I'm going back to my notes real quick. That came about through a parent complaint where we found out that there were items at one of our schools having to deal with hate symbols, and as a result, they made the change. Now we had also talked about looking into that last year during the summer, so what was supposed to happen then did not happen as far as putting it out. There's been some incidents where there has been students wearing things with that kind of thing, which makes me uncomfortable. So if we're serious about making sure all kids feel safe, those kinds of things shouldn't be happening. My take on it is if we really want to make a difference, we need to start looking deeper than just changing names and taking down statues. We need to look at what else we can do to give kids who are being impacted more support and make them feel heard. But yeah, it needs to go beyond just taking away symbols. It means we need to be willing to listen, provide",
        "I'll go ahead. So as some of you know, we did pass a resolution to remove all the remaining Confederate symbols from school names back in November 2020. And since then, it has been up to each individual school with those symbols to come up with new names, which is what they've done. As for other types of imagery like flags, et cetera, that isn't currently explicitly addressed in district policy. There have been instances where they were brought into classrooms before without incident. If there was an instance where it caused disruption in the learning environment or interfered with another student's education, then we would take appropriate disciplinary actions under existing policies such as bullying and hate speech. We don't currently have specific rules against having them on campus just because they can sometimes serve educational purposes, especially if used in historical context or comparative analysis between historical periods. But when they're not being used within that context, we always need to make sure students feel safe."

As a school board member committed to transparency and accountability, I believe it is essential for us to have an open and honest discussion about our policies related to Confederate imagery.\n\nCurrently, our district has a policy prohibiting hate symbols, including those associated with white supremacy and racism. While this policy takes a crucial first step, I acknowledge that some members of our community may feel that it does not go far enough in addressing the presence of Confederate imagery within our schools.\n\nTo ensure we are fostering a safe and inclusive environment for all students, I propose that we engage in a thorough review of our existing policy. This would involve gathering input from various stakeholders, including teachers, administrators, parents, and most importantly, our students themselves. By encouraging respectful and inclusive dialogue, we can gain a deeper understanding of how Confederate imagery affects different individuals and groups within our community.\n\nFurthermore, I recommend exploring potential revisions to our policy that prioritize sensitivity towards historically marginalized communities. We must consider whether certain forms of Confederate imagery, even if deemed \"historical,\" may still perpetuate harmful stereotypes or create a hostile learning environment.\n\nUltimately, as a board member focused on community-centered solutions, my goal is to find a balance between preserving historical context while",

As authorized by ordinance, the County of Alamaro School Board is holding its meetings electronically during the COVID-19 pandemic.

You can also email them directly to school board members individually or as a group.

        "I'm gonna try to get this on one take because it's long. Thank you so much for asking about how we can engage with us through the comment period at school board meetings. That's a super important way that community members like yourself can share your perspectives, concerns or just let us know what you're doing well. So here's an overview of how things work. Public comments fall into two categories: One is regular public comments, which are usually scheduled around 45 minutes after the start of each board meeting. You'll see them listed as item number five in your agenda packet; And then there are special hearing items when we've got something specific coming up, such as budget talks or the strategic plan update. During those times, we open the floor specifically for people who want to address those topics. For either type of comment, whether it's general or topic-specific, if you'd like to sign up, please email the superintendent's assistant Ms. Johnson by 12 PM on the day before the meeting, and she will give you a spot on the list. She's always willing to help if you have trouble getting on the sheet. Now you can also sign up in person right before the meeting at the designated table outside the boardroom",
        "That's actually something we have explicitly stated on the agenda each month when it gets sent out to folks as well as on our website under School Board Meetings. But I'd like to repeat it for everyone because I know there might be new people tuning in. So if you're watching us live or recording this at any point in time, you can see those details there as well. The first thing would be signing up. You have to sign up before the start of the meeting to speak during the public comment section. So let me clarify with staff real quick. Do they do an email where someone has to send in their name and topic and all that stuff or how does that work right now?  (pause) Yeah, so you just go online and fill out that Google form, which again goes to Emily and then she puts together the list. And I guess we'll make sure that we also update our policy so that way. I'm really sorry about that confusion, Ms. Omeish. That was definitely not intentional on my part. If you don't mind, could you remind me what you said so I can write it down? So anyway, please sign up using our electronic method. It says what number you'll be speaking as",
        "Thank you so much for asking that question.  So first off, I appreciate it when we have members of the community who take an active interest in engaging with us through the meetings. That's very important to me. As for answering your specific question, if you want to speak at a school board meeting, just a few minutes before the scheduled start time, there'll be a sign-up sheet on the table outside where people can put their names down. And then during the open forum portion of the meeting - and I know they're not going to make me get up here right now. It takes some getting used to sometimes. During the open forum part of the meeting, the chair calls out each speaker based on the order that they signed up, typically with three-minute time slots.  They also go around and remind everyone about how much time is left after one minute has passed. If someone goes over three minutes though, they politely cut them off because we do need to stick within those limits since this is done within a limited amount of time. Also during public comment sessions like tonight or any other ones, you might notice that board members may write notes but don't verbally respond directly back to what was said. There is no expectation of receiving immediate"

        "So that's a great question, thank you so much for asking it.  The current policy is, we have three minutes per speaker, maximum of ten speakers signed up ahead of time to give us some idea how many people might come in. We've also added language on our website where folks can send comments if they want to submit them electronically because they don't feel comfortable coming in person or whatnot. But currently, I believe there is still social distancing required in the room as well. But that could change based on recommendations from health experts. One thing that was discussed was about if someone wanted to sign up and just bring their written statement. What happens when they get their three minutes? If they're reading off something they wrote, do we count that against their time? That would be counted as part of their speech, right? And we could not tell them they couldn't read from what they wrote. So it would need to be decided whether to continue to go with our standard practice which has been for years since before even I started serving here on the board. There have been concerns raised too by those who attend school board meetings like citizens in attendance, about some kind of more limited format for certain things like an email, but if it",

The last time we did that, I thought there was some confusion about how long we'd let people go or where they were supposed to do it from. That was what made me feel like doing them in advance helped us get more done.  If we started with an hour of open session and spent five minutes talking to each person, I can't even imagine.",

Our typical policy 2-10 says that anyone can attend school board meetings. They're open meetings with certain exceptions. There's a limited amount of people who get to speak, because we don't have unlimited meeting space, so it is capped.  Right now, when you sign up to give comments or testimony on an item on the agenda, there are two ways you do this currently. You either come here and take a physical number from the table at the back and write down what topic you want to address if it doesn't say other, then put it on the list or submit online form which was created as part of the pandemic where you also put in your name and what you're going to talk about. For these virtual sessions, before each session starts, we typically give instructions and make sure everyone knows how they'll hear their names called and that type of thing. This last round since we've had both hybrid and full remote, you see sometimes a lot of attendees join via zoom, but if someone wants to comment or give public testimony that is still done live, usually speaking into a microphone right next to the podium like"

For example, I know there's been talk about this potentially helping out with staffing issues but then on the other hand I also know some parents may have concerns about having these little ones get more screen time during their day. And we were actually talking about this at one of my schools today with my literacy teachers, which is how much more difficult this has made things on them. The reason why kids are supposed to read every day for half an hour is so that they have this consistency in terms of building those foundational skills early. If all of a sudden you're taking away from reading or another content area I don't necessarily know if that makes up for any potential gains we might see somewhere else.

And then from a teacher standpoint, they were talking about potentially doing hybrid stuff, but the hybrid model still means you've got some kids in front of me and maybe another half dozen kids behind them. So it seems like every day there was something new. The CDC says masks are good. They said don't worry about surfaces. Then they went oh wait, yes, do worry about surfaces. We didn't get much guidance. We need a consistent way to make those decisions and to put together plans for these guys, since we",
        "Thank you so much, that's an excellent question. And I'll just start out saying I know how hard this has been for everyone involved. You know, from a very high level, what we're trying to do is make sure that students can get back into buildings safely as quickly as possible while also making sure that staff feels comfortable coming back into those same spaces. In terms of the vaccine specifically, it does seem like there have been some recent improvements in the rollout across various parts of the country. We've had conversations with local health officials who indicated that they would prioritize educators once again. So hopefully, if things continue on their current track, teachers could possibly begin receiving vaccinations soon. But even though the news has seemed better lately, I still want to caution that we shouldn't assume that vaccines are going to suddenly magically solve all problems related to COVID in school settings overnight. We need to maintain those strict safety protocols because, unfortunately, vaccines don't guarantee complete immunity either. There may be a certain percentage that doesn't develop full protection against infection or spreading after being vaccinated, plus people around them might not yet receive shots. That's why I really appreciate the way our administration continues to work closely with state and regional authorities to provide support for educators",
        "I am going to answer that.  My apologies, thank you so much for bringing it up. I want to say first of all, my heart goes out to every single one of our families who have had their world turned upside down since last March when we initially shut down schools. So many people struggling through remote learning, working from home with kids at home or trying to find childcare options. It's been incredibly difficult for everyone involved. And then as a School Board Member here, I get to hear those stories firsthand. You know, personally speaking, my own children struggled really hard with virtual learning last year. They're still dealing with some social anxiety and feelings of isolation now after being back in person part-time. But they do better with structure and routine and just having friends around them. So I definitely appreciate how tough this has been. The decision of whether or not to reopen schools fully in person is something that we've talked about extensively. And what I believe the data shows right now and again, there may be an expert come later tonight to tell us differently but right now based on everything I'm seeing is that elementary schools are pretty safe places even without vaccines because we're masking, distancing, contact tracing, and doing things like that."

As a school board member, I am committed to ensuring the safety of both students and staff while also providing quality education. When it comes to reopening schools, my primary concern is creating an environment where everyone can feel confident and protected from COVID-19 transmission. \n\nTo achieve this goal, we need to carefully consider multiple factors such as local health guidelines, ventilation systems within our facilities, and availability of personal protective equipment (PPE). Moreover, implementing proper hygiene practices, maintaining social distancing protocols, and enforcing mask mandates would be crucial steps towards minimizing risk.\n\nRegarding teacher vaccinations, I believe that prioritizing their access to vaccines is essential since they interact closely with students daily. This not only protects them but also reduces the likelihood of transmissions occurring at schools. Our district should collaborate with local healthcare providers to facilitate vaccine distribution among educators as soon as possible.\n\nBefore making any decisions, however, I want to emphasize the importance of engaging in open dialogue with all stakeholders - including parents, teachers, administrators, and local authorities. By fostering collaborative discussions and listening to diverse perspectives, we can develop well-rounded policies tailored to meet the unique needs of our community.\n\nIn conclusion, as a school board member dedicated to transparency and accountability",

        "Thank you for asking that question. I've been thinking about it a lot because it's such an important issue, especially right now when we're having so many conversations around transparency and community engagement. So my first instinct is to say that we should continue with virtual meetings or at least offer some kind of hybrid option. And here's why.  One reason I'm concerned about going back to just in-person meetings only is accessibility. We know there are members of our community who don't have transportation options to get them to downtown Raleigh. They may not live close enough or they may not have access to reliable internet either if we were doing all-virtual, but at least then they would have the opportunity. There are people with disabilities that make attending in person difficult or impossible. The second thing is safety. When I started serving on this board during COVID, one of the things I was most grateful for was the ability to attend meetings virtually because I didn't want to put myself or others at risk of getting sick. Even though we seem to be out of the pandemic, flu season is still happening every year. It seems like we need to prioritize keeping our schools safe as much as possible. Lastly, childcare. Many parents can't afford babysitters to",
        "I appreciate that we've had to adapt because of COVID, and I'm grateful for technology like Zoom which has allowed us to continue meeting and doing business as usual or at least attempting to during those times when it wasn't safe to meet in person. But personally, I would love to get back to having board meetings in person, especially since things have improved and people feel safer about gathering again. One reason why is that while Zoom can be effective in some ways, there's just something lost with body language, tone, and nonverbal cues which I believe lead to more productive conversations and interactions. If we were back in person, one might find themselves picking up things from someone else across the table that they wouldn't if everyone was behind their screen and mic muted. Another aspect that may influence my position is public accessibility. While yes, virtual attendance is theoretically easier for many people who may not want to drive here or take time off work or make childcare arrangements, in reality, broadband access isn't universally available everywhere. And I know families who don't even have smartphones, let alone computers or Wi-Fi, so then there are people left out of an opportunity to engage if only through Zoom meetings. In addition, though there's always been room for",
        "I mean, we've had some discussion about that at previous meetings as well.  So my personal preference is for in-person board meetings when possible. I understand that Zoom can be very helpful especially during COVID times but now that things have been lifted, we're able to meet in person again, and there's something different that happens with in-person interactions where people feel more comfortable asking questions or engaging if they see us physically rather than just seeing us through screens. And so I would hope that we continue doing it. That said, I am open-minded towards also having a virtual option because of course, that does allow for accessibility for those who may not be close enough to get here easily or for those who need accommodations like audio assistance or closed captions.  But personally, I believe an in-person setting lends itself better to engagement from everyone involved."

        "The challenges that I have heard around elementary-aged kids is the difficulty with self-regulation and sustaining focus on computer-based activities for extended periods of time without adult support. That's going to look different at different grade levels. So I guess that was part of my concern. Like I said earlier, we were doing this as a temporary solution initially when we didn't know what was happening with COVID. We're still seeing those gaps persist even though we've got a year under our belt now of remote or hybrid learning. And so I just want us to make sure we're not assuming that every student has an ability to learn equally through the computer screen and can access that because some don't have internet connectivity at home. Some parents may not feel like they're equipped to help facilitate that kind of learning, especially if there's multiple children in the household trying to do online school simultaneously. So how do we ensure that we are providing equity of opportunity for all learners? How do we provide additional resources? What does training for teachers look like? I mean I'm worried that when these young ones get back into the classroom, we're gonna see another gap that we need to catch up from again, where we're having to spend more money to fill those gaps",
        "The biggest concern I have is we don't know what the right amount of screen time is for kids this young. So I'm concerned that they're going to get too much screen time and not enough hands-on experience with things like blocks, playdough and paint. We can already see from the data on kids using devices at home for entertainment purposes that there's an increased risk of obesity, sleep problems and other health issues if we start them off early. I also wonder who is gonna supervise these children when they're doing remote learning because in many cases they might need help navigating technology, which is hard enough even for adults, but certainly for 5-year-olds or 6-year-olds or even kindergarteners sometimes needing assistance using scissors and gluing stuff together, let alone trying to log into Zoom or whatever platform we would use. I am really worried about social isolation as well. Social skills are learned through interactions with peers. That being said, one way that could adapt that better would be by prioritizing community-based programming where small groups of kids go somewhere once a week, maybe two times a week, and actually interacted with each other face-to-face while still having flexibility around online curriculum delivery. Another thing I've been reading up",
        "So, I have several concerns.  The first one that I mentioned already is my concern about the social emotional impact on young children being isolated from their peers at home when they're only five or six years old, because we know they learn so much through play with other kids and seeing different people's faces, reading their facial expressions. We can't replicate that exactly over Zoom, though I'm sure the teachers are doing everything they can, but there'll still be limitations, so that worries me just like general kid development wise as well as academic, okay? That was one thing I wanted to bring up real quick."

To achieve this, I believe we need to take a multi-step approach. Firstly, it's essential that we clearly communicate the board's goals and objectives to all staff members, including teachers, administrators, and support staff. This should be done through various channels, such as email updates, staff meetings, and departmental gatherings. We must make sure everyone understands what is expected of them and how their individual roles contribute to achieving these goals. Secondly, we should establish clear expectations and key performance indicators (KPIs) for each goal and objective. These KPIs will serve as measurable targets that staff can work towards, providing a sense of accountability and direction. Thirdly, professional development opportunities should be provided to equip staff with the necessary skills and knowledge required to meet these objectives effectively. This could include training sessions, workshops, or coaching programs tailored to specific departments or job functions.

To do this effectively, I propose that we hold a comprehensive professional development session with all staff members during pre-service week, where we explicitly outline our expectations and provide clear guidance on how their roles contribute to achieving those goals. We should also consider providing specific training or workshops focused on key initiatives, such as new curriculum implementations, technology integration, or student wellness programs, so teachers feel equipped to tackle these tasks successfully. Another essential aspect is setting measurable targets and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for each department and individual staff members.

Furthermore, it's vital for the administration to establish regular check-ins with department heads, team leaders, and individual teachers to monitor implementation, address any obstacles, and offer resources when needed.

To start with, over the summer, I propose holding compulsory professional development sessions led by district administrators or external experts where they discuss how our goals align with state requirements and national standards. This session should also clarify expectations on how each department can contribute towards meeting those objectives. During this training, there must be opportunities for discussion, so teachers, counselors, and other support staff share any challenges or concerns related to implementing these new goals effectively. These sessions should lead to actionable steps outlining specific tasks, timelines, and progress indicators that help track success. It is equally crucial that building principals take an active part in reinforcing these goals at the local level. They could facilitate team meetings for individual departments focusing on targeted strategies tailored to each subject area or grade level. Our school leaders must emphasize that all activities undertaken should ultimately serve the broader purposes outlined by the board. Additionally, the superintendent and assistant superintendents should schedule regular check-ins throughout the first semester to assess if everyone stays on target. In"

        "I appreciate you bringing this topic up as it is crucial for us to consider the health, safety, and education of both our students and staff members.  From my perspective, vaccinating our school employees against COVID-19 should remain one of our top priorities at present.  Firstly, ensuring that teachers and other essential personnel within schools have been vaccinated could significantly minimize the risk of transmission among them, subsequently reducing their chances of spreading the virus further into classrooms or homes. This might not completely eliminate the danger posed by COVID-19 but would definitely take us closer towards safer school environments. Secondly, if we can ensure most of our school employees are fully inoculated, it may increase confidence levels among parents about sending their children back to physical classes. Parents are anxious about the safety of their kids when they attend school, which makes sense given what has transpired globally over these past two years. Vaccination efforts could possibly alleviate some of those concerns, potentially leading more families to opt-in for in-person learning options once again. Thirdly, though I understand there's still much debate surrounding mask mandates, social distancing requirements, and the efficacy of such measures in curtailing outbreaks, having an immunized workforce means less reliance on additional layers of protection. If",
        "Well, I would say that there is certainly a lot going on right now with regards to vaccinations for school employees and trying to get back into those classrooms safely. I'll try to break it down as best as I can.  First off, when we look at vaccinations for school staff members - obviously this has been a top priority for us because they're essential workers, you know? They've got kids depending on them every day and so many families relying on them, not just educationally but also from a childcare standpoint. We want to make sure these educators feel safe doing their job. And let's face it, no one wants anyone getting sick or spreading COVID-19 unnecessarily. Now in terms of how quickly we could actually achieve this goal, we have had conversations with local health authorities about expediting vaccine distribution specifically targeted towards teachers and other school personnel. In an ideal world, yes, we'd love to see all of them vaccinated ASAP, especially considering some already qualify under the Phase 1b rollout. However, realistically speaking, supply chain issues still remain an issue, which means we do need to prioritize based upon the most high-risk groups first. That being said, if our county health department were able to provide the necessary doses and",
        "Well, I want to start by saying that as a school board member, my top priority is always the health, safety, and well-being of our students, staff, and community.  Regarding vaccinations for school employees, I believe it's crucial we prioritize their access to vaccines. Our educators have been heroes throughout this pandemic, working tirelessly to adapt to new teaching methods and ensure our children continue receiving quality education. By vaccinating them, we can reduce the risk of transmission within schools, making it safer for everyone involved. Currently, our district has been working closely with local health authorities to facilitate vaccine distribution among school staff. We've established partnerships with nearby hospitals and healthcare providers to expedite the process. While there have been some logistical challenges, I'm encouraged by the progress made so far. Now, when it comes to returning to in-person learning, I understand the eagerness to get back to normalcy. However, I firmly believe we must take a cautious approach. It's essential we consider multiple factors before making any decisions. These include: 1. Vaccination rates: Are enough teachers, support staff, and administrators vaccinated to create a safe environment? 2. Community spread: What's the current COVID-19 positivity rate in our area, and how"

My primary goal is to ensure the health, safety, and well-being of everyone involved.  Firstly, let's acknowledge that COVID-19 has disrupted education worldwide, affecting not only academic progress but also socialization, mental health, and economic stability for many families. Schools serve as community hubs, providing essential services like meals, childcare, and support networks. Therefore, it's crucial we weigh the risks against the benefits of reopening. From a teacher's perspective, I recognize their apprehension about returning to classrooms while there's still a risk of infection. Teachers have legitimate concerns about their own health, potential long-term effects of the virus, and the additional workload associated with implementing new protocols. We must provide them with necessary resources, training, and support to address these worries. Parents, too, are understandably worried about sending their children back into potentially hazardous environments.

Firstly, let me acknowledge the importance of providing a safe learning environment for everyone. The health risks associated with COVID-19 cannot be taken lightly, especially when it comes to vulnerable populations such as young children and immunocompromised individuals. From the perspective of teachers, their safety should be our top priority. They are essential frontline workers who have been entrusted with the education and well-being of our children. If we reopen schools without proper safeguards, we risk exposing them to infection, which could lead to staff shortages and further disrupt the educational process. We must ensure that they have access to personal protective equipment (PPE), regular testing, and flexible work arrangements whenever possible. Parents, understandably, want what's best for their children. Many are concerned about the potential risks of sending their kids back to school, while others may rely on schools for childcare or feel that online learning isn't an effective substitute for in-person instruction.

I understand the importance of resuming in-person learning for academic, social-emotional development, as well as providing essential services like meals and childcare for many families.  Before making any decisions regarding reopening, it's crucial that we consult with public health experts, analyze local transmission rates, hospital capacity, and other relevant data. We must also engage with our stakeholders – teachers, parents, students, and support staff – through surveys, focus groups, or town hall meetings to gain insights into their concerns, ideas, and needs. Regarding teacher concerns, I believe they should have access to necessary personal protective equipment (PPE), training, and resources to effectively teach while maintaining safety protocols. Some educators might require accommodations due to pre-existing medical conditions or age-related vulnerabilities; therefore, offering remote work arrangements could help alleviate some anxiety. From a parental perspective, we need to address worries about student exposure, communication strategies when cases arise, and availability of after-school programs for working families.

Our employees deserve competitive compensation that reflects their value to the district, and this aspect needs further examination. Secondly, considering the length of time since the last significant adjustment, I believe more could've been done to rectify the cumulative impact of stagnant wages. A one-time correction might not be enough; instead, we should explore possibilities for multi-year adjustments to ensure long-term financial security for our staff. Lastly, as we move forward, I propose we implement regular cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) to prevent future stagnation.

Upon reviewing budget projections and industry standards, I believe more needs to be done to ensure fair compensation for our dedicated staff members.

We're always trying to allocate funds effectively between different areas such as teacher salaries, facilities maintenance, curriculum development, technology upgrades, and student support services.  One key challenge is making sure we're being fiscally responsible while also meeting the needs of our students, teachers, and community. For example, we might need to weigh the importance of hiring more staff against investing in infrastructure projects or updating textbooks. Another hurdle is ensuring transparency and collaboration throughout the budgeting process. It's essential to involve various stakeholders – administrators, teachers, parents, and even students themselves – to ensure their voices are heard and valued. This helps us identify potential blind spots and make informed decisions. Over time, we've made significant strides in improving our budgeting process. One major change was implementing a zero-based budgeting approach. Instead of simply incrementing last year's budget by a certain percentage, we start from scratch each year, re-evaluating every line item and justifying its inclusion. This forces us to assess whether each expenditure aligns with our strategic goals and priorities. We've also worked hard to improve communication around",
        "When I first joined the school board, one of the biggest challenges I faced while creating budgets was ensuring that we were allocating resources effectively to meet the needs of all students. As an elected official, it's essential to strike a balance between being fiscally responsible and providing adequate support for educational programs.  Initially, I struggled with understanding the intricacies of our district's financial structure and grasping the nuances of state funding models. However, through extensive training sessions, workshops, and collaboration with our finance team, I gained a deeper comprehension of the budgeting process. One significant challenge is dealing with uncertainty regarding future funding from local, state, and federal sources. We must make educated projections based on historical trends, but there's always a level of unpredictability involved. To mitigate this risk, we've implemented a multi-year forecasting approach, which enables us to anticipate potential shortfalls or surpluses more accurately. Another hurdle is prioritizing competing demands within limited resources. It's crucial to allocate funds strategically, focusing on initiatives that yield the greatest positive impact on student outcomes. Our board has adopted a data-driven decision-making approach, relying on metrics such as academic performance indicators, demographic shifts, and community feedback to inform our spending decisions. Over time, I believe",
        "Well, I would say one of the biggest challenges we face is balancing competing priorities with limited resources. As a school board, we're responsible for allocating funds to support various programs, services, and initiatives that benefit our students, teachers, and community. However, we can't do everything, so we must make tough decisions about where to allocate our finite resources.  Another challenge is trying to predict future expenses and revenues accurately. We rely on historical data and trends, but there's always some degree of uncertainty involved. For instance, enrollment numbers might fluctuate, or state funding could change unexpectedly. This unpredictability makes it difficult to create an accurate budget. Over time, I'd say we've improved our budgeting process significantly. One key improvement has been increasing transparency and stakeholder engagement. We now hold public forums and town halls to gather input from parents, teachers, and administrators on their needs and concerns. This helps us better understand what's working and what areas need more investment. We've also implemented zero-based budgeting, which means every department starts from scratch each year instead of just incrementally adding to previous budgets. This approach forces us to re-evaluate priorities and eliminate unnecessary spending. Furthermore, we've invested in advanced financial software and hired additional"

        "Well, I'll start by saying that attendance policies have always been one of those areas where we're trying to find that perfect balance between holding students accountable for being present and learning, while also understanding that there may be legitimate reasons why they might miss school.  One challenge I've seen is how we define what constitutes an excused absence versus an unexcused absence. Sometimes it can get pretty nuanced. For instance, if a student has a doctor's appointment but doesn't provide documentation, do we count that as excused or not? You'd be surprised at how much debate goes into defining these things. Another issue arises when students come from families who don't prioritize education, or maybe even struggle themselves with their own attendance issues. In cases like this, no matter what policy we put in place, getting them to attend regularly becomes tough because it's just not part of their family culture. So, we need to figure out ways to engage those families more effectively, which isn't easy either. Furthermore, I believe it's essential to acknowledge the unintended consequences tied to punitive measures. If we solely focus on punishing students for truancy without addressing underlying causes, that could drive them further away from engaging with the educational system altogether. We risk pushing kids",
        "One challenge I have noticed is that when attendance policies become overly punitive, it can create more problems than they solve. For instance, if we implement strict penalties for absences, students who are already struggling may feel discouraged from coming to school at all.  Another issue I've seen is that attendance policies often disproportionately affect certain student populations, such as those experiencing homelessness, living in poverty, or dealing with health issues. These students might face circumstances beyond their control that make regular attendance difficult, yet they still need support and resources rather than punishment. Additionally, rigid attendance policies can lead to unnecessary tension between teachers, administrators, and families. If parents are threatened with fines or legal action due to their child's absences, this can create adversarial relationships instead of fostering collaboration and trust. In terms of unintended consequences, I believe some attendance policies inadvertently incentivize students to come to school even when they're not well enough to learn effectively. This not only puts other students at risk of getting sick but also undermines academic performance overall. Lastly, an overemphasis on attendance numbers can distract us from addressing the root causes of absenteeism. By focusing solely on attendance rates, we might overlook opportunities to address systemic issues like inadequate transportation, lack of access to healthcare, or ineffective",
        "As a school board member, I have observed several challenges and unintended consequences associated with traditional attendance policies in schools.  Firstly, one of the primary concerns is the negative impact on students who face circumstances beyond their control, such as poverty, homelessness, health issues, or family crises, which may lead to chronic absences. These students often fall behind academically due to no fault of their own, and punitive attendance policies can further exacerbate the issue rather than providing support. Another challenge lies in the potential for disparate impact. For instance, minority students, English language learners, and those from low-income backgrounds tend to be disproportionately affected by strict attendance policies. This can result in an increased risk of these students being pushed out of mainstream education and into alternative settings or even the criminal justice system. Furthermore, overly restrictive attendance policies can create a culture of fear among students, leading them to attend school while ill or when they're not emotionally prepared to learn. This can spread illnesses throughout the student body and staff, ultimately affecting overall academic performance and well-being. Additionally, rigid attendance policies might inadvertently incentivize parents to keep their children home for trivial reasons, fearing repercussions if their child misses too many days. Conversely, lenient policies could lead to abuse,"

However, as a school board member committed to fairness and inclusion, I've observed several challenges and unintended consequences.\n\nOne major concern is how these policies disproportionately affect certain student populations. For instance, students from low-income households may need to take care of family members or work part-time jobs to support their families, leading to unavoidable absences. Similarly, students with disabilities might require more frequent medical appointments or experience anxiety-related issues that make it difficult for them to attend school regularly.\n\nAnother challenge lies in the overly punitive nature of traditional attendance policies. When we focus solely on punishing truancy rather than addressing its root causes, we risk further disengaging already struggling students. This approach can lead to a vicious cycle where students fall behind academically, feel disconnected from their peers, and ultimately become even less motivated to attend classes.\n\nAdditionally, rigid attendance policies often fail to account for extenuating circumstances such as homelessness, foster care situations, or refugee status.

        "I see both sides of this issue. On one hand, we have to make sure students feel safe when they come to school every day. Having law enforcement present can certainly help deter violent behavior and provide an added layer of security.  On the other hand, some people worry that having police officers at schools could create a prison-like atmosphere and may disproportionately affect certain student groups. There is also concern about over-policing and potentially turning misbehaving kids into criminals rather than addressing any underlying issues through counseling or disciplinary action within the school system. In my opinion, if there were to be police officers present on campus, they would need proper training to handle interactions with children effectively, de-escalate conflicts, and deal with diverse populations. We'd want these individuals to act as mentors, not simply enforcers of discipline. It should be made clear what specific situations call for officer involvement versus handling incidents internally. Additionally, any decision regarding officers on campus must involve open dialogue between teachers, parents, administrators, local authorities, and most importantly, the students themselves. Their voices matter greatly here. Ideally, such collaboration could lead to creating safer environments without undermining trust or making our educational settings feel overly policed.",
        "Well, as a school board member, my top priority is always the safety and well-being of our students. When it comes to having police officers on campus, I have mixed feelings about it.  On one hand, I understand the argument that having law enforcement presence can provide an added layer of security and deter potential threats. In today's world, we've seen far too many tragic incidents involving violence in schools, and if having police officers on site could potentially prevent or respond more effectively to such situations, then that's certainly something worth considering. However, I also worry about the impact that a police presence might have on certain student populations, particularly those from marginalized communities who may already feel targeted or over-policed outside of school. We need to ensure that any decision we make doesn't inadvertently create a culture of fear or mistrust between our students and law enforcement. I'd want to explore alternative solutions as well, like investing in social-emotional support services, mental health resources, and restorative justice programs. These approaches focus on addressing root causes of conflict and promoting positive relationships within the school community, rather than simply relying on a punitive approach. Ultimately, whether or not to have police officers on campus should depend on careful consideration of our specific school environment and",
        "As a school board member, I believe that the primary concern of any decision we make should always be the safety and well-being of our students. When considering whether or not to have police officers present on campus, there are several factors that need to be taken into account.  Firstly, let me say that no one wants to see students intimidated or criminalized. Our schools should be safe havens where children can learn without fear or anxiety about being ticketed or arrested for minor infractions. However, it is also true that certain situations may arise which necessitate the presence of law enforcement officials. In my opinion, it is essential to strike a balance between ensuring student safety and avoiding over-policing on campuses. To achieve this balance, I would propose that we adopt an approach where School Resource Officers (SROs) are trained specifically to work within educational settings. These SROs should undergo rigorous training to address issues specific to adolescents, such as mental health concerns, de-escalation techniques, and cultural sensitivity. This training could include working closely with teachers, administrators, and counselors to identify potential problems before they escalate. Having SROs who understand the nuances of adolescence can help create trust between law enforcement and students. By building positive relationships"

        "So I think one of the most effective ways to gather honest feedback from students is through anonymous surveys or focus groups where they feel comfortable sharing their thoughts without fear of retribution. We can also consider having student ambassadors or representatives on various committees that provide input directly to administration.  One limitation with our current approach is relying solely on end-of-semester evaluations. These might not capture the full picture since they're often done when students are stressed about finals or already checked out for the summer. Additionally, some students may not take them seriously or see it as an opportunity to vent rather than providing constructive criticism. Another issue could be survey fatigue if we ask too many questions at once or send too many requests throughout the year. This might lead to lower participation rates and less thoughtful responses. To address this, I suggest staggering surveys throughout the semester or focusing on specific areas like curriculum development or facilities improvements. Lastly, it's essential to ensure diverse representation among respondents to guarantee all voices are heard. That means actively seeking input from underrepresented groups such as first-generation college students, international students, or those with disabilities. By diversifying our methods and avoiding pitfalls like survey fatigue, I believe we can gather more accurate and actionable feedback from students, ultimately enhancing their educational experience.",
        "Ah-ha! That's an excellent question. As a school board member, I believe it's crucial for us to regularly solicit authentic feedback from students to understand their needs better. To ensure we receive genuine input, I'd recommend adopting a multi-faceted approach.  Firstly, surveys could be administered at regular intervals throughout the year, covering various aspects of student life, such as academic experiences, social interactions, extracurricular activities, and campus climate. However, it's essential that these surveys remain anonymous or confidential to encourage students to share their true opinions without fear of judgment or repercussions. Secondly, we should establish focus groups with diverse representation across grade levels, interests, and demographics. These smaller group settings allow for more open discussions and provide opportunities for students to elaborate on their thoughts and feelings about specific issues. Thirdly, one-on-one interviews can offer even deeper insights into individual concerns and experiences. Perhaps teachers or trusted administrators could conduct these interviews to build rapport and trust with students. Now, regarding potential limitations of our current approach – I'm concerned that our existing methods might not effectively reach all segments of our student population. For instance: 1. Language barriers: We need to ensure survey materials and communication channels cater to non-English",
        "Well, I believe gathering genuine feedback from students can be challenging because sometimes they may not feel comfortable sharing their opinions or may fear that their answers might affect their academic standing. But if we want to improve their educational experience and create positive changes within our district, it's crucial that we get honest input from them.  One potential strategy could be conducting surveys or focus groups anonymously so that students know their responses won't be linked back to them directly. Additionally, teachers and administrators should build trust with the student body by consistently demonstrating that they value and take action based on student concerns. By doing this, we can foster an environment where students truly feel heard and empowered to share their thoughts openly. Currently, one limitation of our existing approach is that often these forms are administered solely during class time. This structure doesn't allow for participation from all students equally since some students have conflicting commitments like extracurricular activities, jobs, or family responsibilities. To address this issue, providing online opportunities or offering incentives for participation could increase engagement and ensure more diverse perspectives are represented in the data collected. Another important consideration is analyzing how the results of these surveys are shared and utilized afterwards.

It's not necessarily what I would have anticipated in terms of the number of incidents per school and those sorts of things. I just found that some of those numbers are very odd. It strikes me that despite our intent that police officers not become involved in discipline, it seems to me that they must be because the largest number of incidents involve, and I'm breaking it out as the reports that were done, but defiance, being inconsiderate, using profanity, all of which do not seem to me the kind of thing that an SRO would be the ideal person to deal with. A defiant student doesn't need a police officer. They need an administrator or a teacher dealing with that. And if the teacher can't deal with it, the administrators deal with that. I don't see where that rises to the level of an SRO. I was concerned about the numbers at some of the schools. I mean, there's a disparity at the different schools. And so, I mean, I'm more troubled, to be honest with you, I'm more troubled by the SRO program now than I was before. I think the information actually makes me feel worse about it.

        "Well, I appreciate being able to review these incident reports and statistics related to the School Resource Officer (SRO) program. As a school board member, it's essential for me to have access to this information to make informed decisions.  Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there has been a significant decrease in disciplinary incidents since the implementation of the SRO program. The number of reported fights, disruptions, and instances of vandalism has decreased by approximately 25%. This suggests that having an SRO present on campus may indeed contribute to a safer learning environment, which is one of our primary goals as educators. However, I also observe that the majority of arrests made by SROs involve students from underrepresented groups, such as African American and Hispanic students. This raises concerns about potential biases and disparities within the program. It's crucial that we address any underlying issues contributing to these discrepancies and ensure that our discipline policies do not disproportionately affect certain student populations. Another aspect worth noting is the anecdotal feedback from teachers, parents, and students regarding the positive relationships built between SROs and members of the school community. Many have expressed appreciation for the added sense of security and the proactive approach taken by SROs to prevent conflicts before they escalate. Moving forward",
        "After carefully reviewing the incident reports and statistics, I have mixed feelings about the School Resource Officer (SRO) program.  Firstly, it's clear that having an SRO presence has led to a decrease in reported incidents of drug possession and fights within schools. The data shows a 15% reduction in these types of incidents over the past two years since the implementation of the program. This is certainly a positive trend, as it suggests that students feel safer with law enforcement present, which can lead to improved academic performance and overall well-being. However, upon closer examination, some concerning patterns emerge. There appears to be a disproportionate impact on minority students, particularly African American males. They account for a significant percentage of referrals to law enforcement and arrests compared to their demographic makeup in the student population. Additionally, there were several instances where minor infractions resulted in escalated responses from the SROs, leading to unnecessary citations or detentions. These concerns give me pause because they speak to potential issues around implicit bias, equity, and restorative justice. As a school board member, my primary concern should always be the well-being and education of all students. While safety is crucial, we must ensure that it doesn't come at the cost of disproportionately targeting specific groups",
        "After carefully reviewing the incident reports and statistics, I must admit that my initial impressions of the School Resource Officer (SRO) program have been nuanced. At first glance, the data suggests that the presence of SROs has contributed to an overall decrease in disciplinary incidents within our schools. This is certainly a positive trend, as it indicates a safer learning environment for our students.  However, upon closer examination, I've noticed some concerning patterns. For instance, there appears to be a disproportionate number of incidents involving students from historically marginalized communities – specifically African American and Latino students. These students seem more likely to be involved in interactions with SROs, which often result in suspensions or arrests. This disparity raises important questions about potential biases and the role of implicit bias training for our SROs. As a school board member, it's essential for me to consider whether these outcomes are indicative of systemic issues rather than simply reflecting student behavior. Have we inadvertently created a system where certain groups of students are disproportionately policed? Furthermore, I'd like to explore alternative approaches that focus on restorative justice and social-emotional support, rather than relying solely on law enforcement interventions. By doing so, we might create a more equitable and supportive environment that addresses the root"

        "Yes. One case that comes to mind is when I was serving on the disciplinary committee for an incident involving a student who had been accused of disrupting class and disrespecting his teacher.  Initially, it seemed like an open-and-shut case based on the teacher's account - the student had shouted at her during a lesson, refused to apologize, and continued to cause chaos until he was removed from the classroom. However, as we dug deeper into the incident through interviews with the student, witnesses, and even reviewing security footage, it became clear that there were some mitigating circumstances that hadn't initially come to light. The student had been experiencing some personal difficulties at home related to bullying outside of school and felt overwhelmed. Moreover, it turned out that the teacher, though well-intentioned, might have unintentionally escalated the situation due to cultural differences and misunderstandings around tone and language. It wasn't necessarily intentional disrespect but rather miscommunication. Once all parties involved understood each other better, we decided against suspension and instead opted for restorative justice practices, which included counseling sessions for both the teacher and the student to work together to find ways to improve their communication dynamics. Ultimately, this outcome allowed us not only to address the immediate issue but also created space",
        "Yes, I can recall an incident that comes to mind where a student's behavior was initially misinterpreted, leading to some tension between teachers, administrators, and parents. The story goes like this.  One day during recess at one of our elementary schools, a teacher reported that a 7-year-old boy had pushed another kid on the playground, which led to the other child crying. Following standard protocol, the classroom teacher removed the accused student from playtime as a consequence for his actions. However, upon further investigation, it turned out that there was more context behind what happened. During interviews with both students involved and some witnesses, we discovered that the \"push\" was actually an attempt by the first student to help the second student who was about to fall off the jungle gym due to losing balance. It became clear that the initial judgment call made by the teacher was based on incomplete information. Once we dug deeper into the facts surrounding the event, it became apparent that the student didn't have any malicious intent but rather acted instinctively out of concern for their peer's safety. To resolve the situation, we organized a restorative circle involving both families, the teacher, and school administration. This facilitated open communication among all parties, fostering empathy,",
        "Oh, yes, I remember an incident that happened about two years ago at one of our elementary schools. A 7-year-old boy with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) kept getting into trouble for \"misbehaving\" during recess. He would often take toys from other kids without asking and become very upset if someone tried to take them back. His teacher reported that he just didn't seem to understand why his actions were causing problems.  At first, we considered disciplinary action, but then I remembered attending a workshop on ASD and its effects on social interactions. It occurred to me that this child might not have the same understanding of social cues as his peers. I suggested that we bring in an expert to assess the situation and help us develop a more informed approach. We consulted with a specialist who worked closely with children with ASD. She observed the student's behavior, spoke with him, and met with his parents. Her assessment revealed that the boy wasn't trying to be malicious; rather, he genuinely struggled with understanding personal space and sharing due to his condition. With her guidance, we developed strategies tailored to his needs. We taught him specific rules for taking turns and asking permission before touching others' belongings. We also set up visual reminders around the playground"

His family had migrated to the United States just a few months prior, and English wasn't their primary spoken language. \n\nBalancing idealism with pragmatic solutions, we worked together - administration, teachers, counselors, and the student's family - to develop a plan tailored to his unique requirements.

Over time, not only did his grades improve significantly but also his confidence grew, enabling him to participate more actively in class discussions.\n\nThis experience taught me the importance of seeking common ground among diverse perspectives, being committed to fairness and inclusion, and understanding students within their historical contexts.

        "As a school board member, I believe that it is crucial for us to ensure students feel safe at school so they can focus on their education without any fear of violence or other safety concerns. Stationing police officers inside schools may not necessarily be the best solution but there should definitely be close collaboration with local law enforcement.  In my opinion, one possible approach would be establishing School Resource Officers (SROs), who are trained professionals responsible for building positive relationships with students while also addressing potential criminal behavior. These SROs must receive specialized training on working in an educational setting, cultural sensitivity, de-escalation techniques, and crisis intervention. This way, we foster trust among both students and teachers alike. An essential aspect here would be implementing robust protocols outlining clear roles, responsibilities, and procedures for SROs when intervening in incidents related to student misconduct. Additionally, these protocols need to define scenarios where officers engage in disciplinary actions versus school administrators handling them internally. Involving stakeholders such as parents, educators, mental health experts, and community leaders during policy development helps guarantee that policies serve everyone's needs fairly and efficiently. The school administration should closely monitor data on arrests made within the campus grounds and review these statistics regularly to identify patterns and adjust strategies accordingly",
        "Ah-ha! I have given this topic considerable thought, and I must say it's an excellent question. As a school board member, my primary concern is always student safety and well-being.  In principle, I believe that stationing police officers within schools can have both positive and negative effects. On one hand, having law enforcement present can deter potential threats, provide an added layer of security, and even serve as a resource for students who may need guidance or support. This is especially important for schools with higher crime rates or those located in areas prone to violence. On the other hand, I worry about the potential unintended consequences of increased police presence. Research suggests that overly aggressive policing in schools can lead to the criminalization of minor infractions, disproportionately affecting marginalized communities. We've seen instances where students are arrested for non-violent offenses like disorderly conduct or truancy, which ultimately funnels them into the juvenile justice system instead of addressing underlying issues. To strike a balance, I propose structuring the relationship between schools and the police system around these core principles: 1. **Clear roles and responsibilities**: Ensure that police officers assigned to schools understand their role goes beyond traditional law enforcement. They should prioritize building trust, providing mentorship, and serving",
        "The presence of law enforcement in schools is an important consideration for ensuring student safety, but it's crucial we strike a balance between maintaining order and avoiding criminalization of students.  On one hand, I believe that police officers can play a vital role in addressing specific incidents or providing support during crisis situations. For instance, if there were an active shooter situation, it would be essential to have trained professionals on site who could respond quickly and appropriately. Additionally, they might provide valuable resources like crime prevention programs, educational workshops, and counseling services. However, I also understand concerns about over-policing and its potential impact on marginalized communities, particularly minority students. It's been well-documented that these groups often face disproportionate disciplinary actions, which may result from biases embedded within existing systems. Therefore, any collaboration with law enforcement must involve strict protocols to ensure fairness and equity. To structure this relationship effectively, I propose establishing clear guidelines outlining when and how law enforcement intervention should occur. Schools and local authorities should work together to define what constitutes a legitimate threat necessitating police involvement. Furthermore, police training should focus on de-escalation techniques and cultural sensitivity to minimize unnecessary confrontations. Additionally, data collection and transparency are key components of evaluating effectiveness. Regular assessments would help identify"

We need to have accurate representation from all walks of life within our community for us to make informed decisions. What I am saying is if not everyone has equal access or opportunity to respond, then does the result reflect an actual snapshot of what our people really want?  Another concern I raised during the discussion at the last meeting - why were those specific questions chosen? Did they cover everything which needs addressing? Were these open-ended questions to allow individuals to share their genuine feelings rather than forced into yes/no or multiple-choice answers? This is crucial because respondents who feel stifled won't take part in giving meaningful responses. Now moving forward, inaccurate information can lead to ineffective solutions, resulting in wasting resources down the line. That said, if we don't understand what exactly went wrong here, we're doomed to repeat these mistakes.

        "As a school board member, I have some reservations regarding the methodology employed to collect data on the community's health. Specifically, my primary concern revolves around sampling bias. The study relies heavily on surveys administered at local health fairs and farmers' markets.  From what I understand, these events primarily attract individuals who already prioritize their well-being or have an interest in healthcare. This self-selection may result in overrepresentation of healthier demographics within the sample population. Consequently, we risk obtaining skewed results that don't accurately reflect the overall health status of our community as a whole. For instance, we could end up underestimating rates of chronic diseases like diabetes, obesity, or hypertension among lower-income households, racial minorities, or elderly residents who may not attend such events regularly. Furthermore, this limited scope may also overlook potential environmental factors contributing to poor health outcomes, such as air quality, access to green spaces, or food insecurity. To gain a more comprehensive picture of our community's health, I would suggest supplementing the current approach with additional methodologies. We should consider conducting random household surveys, leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) from local hospitals and clinics, or even collaborating with community-based organizations serving vulnerable populations. By diversifying our data sources, we can",
        "Well, first off, let me say that I appreciate the effort put into gathering this data. However, as I dug deeper, I started to have some reservations regarding the methodology employed.  My primary concern is sampling bias. From what I understand, the survey was only distributed online, which may not accurately represent the views of all members within our community, particularly those who don't have reliable internet access or aren't tech-savvy. This could lead to an underrepresentation of vulnerable populations, such as low-income families or seniors, whose voices need to be heard when addressing community health issues. Furthermore, self-reported surveys can be susceptible to social desirability bias, where respondents provide answers they believe are socially acceptable rather than their genuine experiences. For instance, individuals might downplay or omit sensitive information related to mental health or substance abuse due to stigma attached to these topics. Another area of concern for me is the sample size itself. While 500 participants seem like a decent number at first glance, considering our district has over 50,000 residents, it represents merely around 1% of the population.

We were already facing challenges related to funding, outdated infrastructure, and ensuring equity for all students. However, COVID-19 has exacerbated these issues and brought new ones to light. The most pressing concern is the significant learning loss experienced by many students, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds. The shift to remote or hybrid learning has widened the achievement gap, making it more difficult for us to ensure every student receives a quality education. Our district has invested heavily in digital resources, but we still struggle with providing reliable internet access and devices to all families. Another challenge is teacher burnout. Educators have been working tirelessly to adapt their teaching methods, often without adequate support or resources. It's heartbreaking to see dedicated professionals feeling overwhelmed and underappreciated. As a result, we're experiencing higher rates of teacher turnover, which only adds to the instability. On a personal level, my workload has increased exponentially since the pandemic began. With the constant need to reassess and adjust policies, procedures, and safety protocols, it",
        "Ah, wow, that's a really tough but important question. As a school board member, I have to say that my honest thoughts on the current state of the school system are mixed.  On one hand, I'm incredibly proud of the resilience and adaptability shown by our students, teachers, staff, and administrators during this pandemic. The way everyone came together to transition to remote learning, implement safety protocols, and support each other through unprecedented challenges is truly remarkable. However, it would be naive to ignore the significant difficulties we're facing. Pre-pandemic, our schools were already grappling with issues like funding shortfalls, outdated infrastructure, and achievement gaps. The pandemic has only exacerbated these problems. We've seen decreased student engagement, increased absenteeism, and concerns about mental health and social-emotional well-being. As for me personally, being a school board member during the pandemic has been both heartbreaking and eye-opening. Seeing firsthand the impact on families who rely heavily on our schools for not just education but also food security, healthcare access, and community connection has been devastating. At times, it feels like we're fighting an uphill battle, trying to balance competing priorities while navigating ever-changing guidelines and restrictions. There have been moments when I felt overwhelmed,",
        "I appreciate you asking me for my honest opinion. As a school board member, it's crucial to acknowledge that our education system is facing unprecedented challenges. Pre-pandemic, we were already grappling with issues like budget constraints, teacher shortages, and achievement gaps.  When COVID-19 hit, everything changed overnight. The sudden shift to remote learning exposed the deep-seated inequities within our district. Some students had access to reliable technology and stable internet at home, while others didn't even have devices or Wi-Fi. This digital divide exacerbated existing disparities, making it difficult for certain students to keep up with their peers. As a board member, my primary concern was ensuring student safety and well-being during this crisis. We worked tirelessly to implement protocols, procure PPE, and provide resources for teachers adapting to virtual instruction. However, it soon became apparent that our efforts were merely band-aids on a much larger issue – the systemic shortcomings that predated the pandemic. The pandemic has forced us to confront these underlying problems head-on. For instance, we've realized that our infrastructure wasn't designed to support widespread remote learning. Our outdated facilities lacked the necessary technology and bandwidth to accommodate online classes, leaving many students disconnected from educational opportunities. Despite these hurdles,"

As I reflect on my time serving as a school board member, I must say that my honest assessment is that our school system faces significant challenges, even prior to the pandemic. However, it's crucial to acknowledge that COVID-19 has undoubtedly exacerbated these existing issues while also introducing new complexities.\n\nWith respect to history and context, we've seen declining resources, increasing class sizes, and growing disparities among student populations – particularly those from low-income backgrounds or with special needs. These concerns were already weighing heavily on my mind before March 2020.\n\nThe pandemic has brought about unprecedented obstacles, forcing us to adapt rapidly and creatively. We've had to navigate the blurred lines between remote learning, health protocols, and emotional support for students, families, and educators alike. The sheer magnitude of logistical hurdles cannot be overstated, yet, despite these difficulties, I remain steadfastly committed to fairness and inclusion within our educational ecosystem.\n\nIn terms of its impact on my own work, the pandemic has underscored the need for collaboration, flexibility, and empathy like never before.

        "I believe one challenge that many people face when communicating effectively is having their message understood by their intended audience. To address this issue, active listening skills should be practiced on both sides of the conversation. As an individual, it's important to pay attention not only to what someone else says but also how they say it. Nonverbal cues such as body language can provide valuable context for understanding another person's perspective.  As a School Board Member, I often communicate with teachers, administrators, students, and parents who may have different perspectives on educational issues. Therefore, effective communication is essential in ensuring everyone is aligned towards achieving the same goals. In my experience, a few strategies can help improve communication. Firstly, it is crucial to define clear expectations at the beginning of any project or initiative. This helps ensure all stakeholders understand what needs to be accomplished and their roles within the process. Secondly, establishing open lines of communication is vital. Encouraging feedback from colleagues, subordinates, and even superiors promotes trust and fosters collaboration. Thirdly, cultural sensitivity plays a significant role in communication. Being aware of the diverse backgrounds and experiences of those involved aids in crafting messages that resonate with each group. Empathy and patience are critical components here, allowing",
        "As a school board member, I encounter various communication challenges in my role that can impact collaboration and decision-making within the organization. Let me break down some specific difficulties and potential solutions.  1. Diverse perspectives and opinions: With seven members on the school board, we come from different backgrounds and have unique experiences. Our varied viewpoints often lead to robust discussions but may cause misunderstandings or miscommunication. Solution: Active listening skills are crucial. By focusing intently on each other's thoughts and concerns, clarifying ambiguities, and avoiding interruptions, we foster an environment where all voices are heard and respected. 2. Time constraints and conflicting schedules: School board meetings often take place during evenings after long workdays, leading to mental fatigue. Additionally, individual committee responsibilities consume significant time outside of regular sessions. This pressure might result in inadequate preparation for meetings or incomplete information exchange. Solution: Organizing materials and agenda items ahead of time helps ensure thorough understanding. Setting clear expectations regarding necessary reading materials, reports, and presentations before meetings saves time and encourages informed discussion. 3. Power dynamics and groupthink: It is possible for dominant personalities or strong convictions to sway decisions without sufficient input from quieter or less assertive individuals. Solution: Establishing ground rules such as equal",
        "Ah-ha! As a school board member, I've encountered my fair share of communication hurdles in professional settings.  One major challenge I face is ensuring that all stakeholders - parents, teachers, administrators, and students - have equal access to information and opportunities for input. This can be difficult, especially when dealing with sensitive or complex issues like budget decisions or policy changes. To address this, I prioritize transparency and inclusivity. For instance, I make sure meeting agendas and minutes are publicly available, and we provide multilingual support for non-English speakers. Additionally, I hold regular town hall meetings and office hours to encourage open dialogue and hear concerns directly from community members. Another hurdle is navigating differing opinions and perspectives within the board itself. With diverse viewpoints comes the risk of misunderstandings and miscommunication. To mitigate this, I foster an environment where respectful disagreement is encouraged, and active listening is key. We also engage in constructive debates, focusing on facts rather than personal attacks. Lastly, staying up-to-date with evolving technologies and platforms can be daunting. In today's digital age, it's crucial to leverage tools that facilitate effective communication. Our district invests in user-friendly online portals, mobile apps, and social media channels to keep everyone informed and engaged."

This means making a conscious effort to engage with diverse perspectives, asking clarifying questions, and seeking feedback throughout decision-making processes.\n\nAnother strategy involves recognizing and addressing implicit biases within ourselves and our systems. As educators, we strive to model inclusive behavior; however, unconscious biases can still seep into our language and actions. By acknowledging and working through these biases collectively, we can foster more equitable and effective communication practices.\n\nSeeking common ground also becomes crucial when navigating complex issues like budget allocations, curriculum changes, or policy reforms.

        "Well, I've had the opportunity to observe and participate in several meetings since joining this board, and while we have accomplished some important work, I believe there's definitely room for improvement when it comes to the dynamics between us.  Firstly, communication could certainly be enhanced. What I mean by that is ensuring each member feels heard, understood, and valued within discussions. This can sometimes get lost amidst differing opinions or time constraints. So, one strategy I would propose is implementing active listening exercises during workshops or retreats, where we focus on truly understanding each other's perspectives before reacting. It may seem simple, but these small steps can foster more empathy and trust amongst ourselves. Another key aspect I see as lacking is clear role definition. Sometimes, unclear expectations lead to confusion about who should take charge of specific tasks or projects. By establishing well-defined roles and responsibilities upfront, everyone knows their part in contributing to success and what they're accountable for. For instance, creating an updated committee structure outlining tasks and deliverables can help alleviate any potential miscommunication and allow smoother collaboration. Finally, to build stronger bonds and camaraderie, it might be beneficial for the board to engage in team-building activities outside of official business sessions. Whether it's organizing social gatherings,",

To improve relationships among board members, I propose that we implement regular, structured team-building activities outside of formal meetings. This could include workshops or retreats where we engage in open discussions, role-playing exercises, or even community service projects together. By doing so, we'll foster trust, build stronger bonds, and develop a deeper understanding of each other's strengths and weaknesses. Another crucial aspect would be to establish clear expectations around respectful dialogue and constructive criticism during meetings. We need to create an environment where every voice feels heard and valued. To achieve this, I suggest we set ground rules for our interactions, such as avoiding personal attacks, staying focused on topics at hand, and using \"I\" statements instead of accusatory language. Additionally, I'd advocate for more frequent check-ins between meetings, perhaps through monthly one-on-ones with fellow board members. These informal chats can help us stay connected, address potential issues before they escalate, and facilitate collaboration on specific initiatives. Lastly",

Active listening sessions: Let's establish regular check-ins where each member has an opportunity to voice their concerns, ask questions, or provide feedback without fear of judgment. This could take place during pre-meeting gatherings or informal meetups outside formal meetings. By actively listening, we can begin to break down barriers, clarify misconceptions, and develop deeper empathy for differing viewpoints. 2. Collaborative goal-setting workshops: To align our collective focus toward shared objectives, it would benefit us to organize annual (or bi-annual) retreats aimed at setting mutually agreed-upon goals. This collaborative environment fosters trust, enables transparent discussion around priorities, and empowers individual voices while emphasizing collective accountability.

While I understand that sports play an essential role in developing teamwork skills, discipline, and character, I strongly believe that academics should remain the top priority for several reasons.  Firstly, as educators, it is our primary responsibility to ensure that students receive a quality education that prepares them for their future careers and lives. In today's competitive world, academic achievement opens doors to opportunities that can have a lasting impact on one's life trajectory. By focusing on academics, we equip our students with the necessary knowledge, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills to excel in their chosen paths. Secondly, while sports are undoubtedly beneficial for physical and emotional well-being, they cannot replace the cognitive development and intellectual growth that comes from rigorous academic pursuits. A strong foundation in core subjects like mathematics, language arts, science, and social studies lays the groundwork for lifelong learning and success. Thirdly, the ongoing pandemic has already disrupted student learning, resulting in significant gaps in academic performance.

Now, let me break it down for you.  Firstly, we must acknowledge that both aspects have their own merits. Sports can foster teamwork, discipline, physical fitness, and social skills – all valuable life skills. On the other hand, academics lay the foundation for future success and provide a solid understanding of various subjects. However, given the unique circumstances of this school year, I believe we should prioritize academics over sports for several reasons: 1. **Academic Recovery**: With the pandemic's disruption to traditional learning, many students may still be struggling to catch up or adjust to new teaching methods. By focusing on academics, we ensure students receive adequate support to bridge any knowledge gaps. 2. **Mental Health Concerns**: You're right; student well-being is crucial. Excessive pressure from sports commitments might exacerbate stress levels, which could negatively impact mental health. A more balanced approach would allow students to manage their time effectively, reducing anxiety and burnout risks. 3. **Parental Expectations**: Many parents expect schools to provide a comprehensive education, emphasizing core subjects",

Considering the concerns raised about mental health, it's essential to acknowledge the potential negative impacts of excessive focus on sports. Overemphasis on athletics can lead to added stress, pressure to perform, and increased risk of burnout, which may negatively affect students' mental health. Therefore, I propose the following approach: 1. Review and adjust schedules: Ensure that athletic events do not conflict with critical academic periods or interfere excessively with study time. This might involve rescheduling games or practices during less intense academic weeks. 2. Monitor student workloads: Implement checks and balances to prevent students from taking on too many commitments, allowing them sufficient time for academic responsibilities and personal activities outside of sports. 3.

Powerful ideas sometimes are described as throwing a rock in a river and watching it generate huge ripples that keep getting larger until they encompass a large area. This analogy can fit people as well as ideas. And so it was with Pete Fittner. To give you a sense of the length of his service, he was hired by Joe Vining to teach at Brownsville right out of ed school. In those days, Brownsville had 180 students. Pete also supported math students at Aetna Hurt and Woodbrook, and taught at Burleigh, where he received our community's highest award for teaching, the Golden Apple. His principal, Cassandra Blount, called him a trifecta as a teacher. She described his three superpowers as always building confidence in his students, treating students in a way that makes them want to reach their highest expectations, and he was so skilled in his methods that he could easily adapt to any student's need. He was known at Burleigh as King of the Dungeon, referring to the sixth grade's location on the basement level floor of the school. When you help kids begin to find their place in the world, Pete once said, you begin to find yourself too. Once you embrace who you are, the more you can give to help the students. If you are doing it right, the kids help you through the day. They help you as much as you help them. I want my students to fight for themselves and what they believe in was one of Pete's favorite thoughts. I tell them fight for you and fight for what you want. No matter what happens, you have to keep moving forward. You have to keep fighting. Pete's wife, Nancy, who teaches at Brownsville, said he kept doing that right up until this week.

Two, the love that everyone had for him which truly came from all aspects of the school system, staff, teachers, administrators, parents, everybody just admired and loved the man very much so. The second part is that many folks don't know too much about the behind-the-scenes work he put into getting various clubs organized such as the Key Club or Interact club where he took on leadership roles there and helped the young folks learn volunteerism, helping others in their communities, etcetera, and teaching them important life skills.

And they listened not only because what he said made sense but also because they could tell he genuinely cared for them as individuals. His ability to relate to kids from all walks of life and backgrounds, make connections with each student and understand their unique strengths and challenges really stood out.

        "OK, I'll answer that first because I actually started to say something about it before my other colleague. The data is very telling, and what we're seeing is improvement at some levels and still challenges with others. And certainly, looking at both our SOL scores and benchmark assessments, there have been improvements in certain areas. However, it is clear that we do continue to see disparities or achievement gaps among different subgroups of students based on race and ethnicity, English language learners, and those who are economically disadvantaged. And so as we work together as a board and administration, I believe our focus really needs to be around addressing these disparate outcomes for all of our student populations, particularly those who need extra support. We've heard about several strategies being implemented this year and last year, including targeted small group instruction, professional development opportunities for teachers, and increased supports for literacy and mathematics instruction. But I also want to add that we should explore further research-based interventions such as after-school programs, mentorship initiatives, extended summer learning programs, and potential partnerships with community organizations and local businesses. Additionally, one thing I would like us to look into further, especially since we now have our chief equity officer position filled, is an examination of how teacher diversity compares to student",

        "OK, thank you. Thank you very much. Yeah, I know.  So what's really important is that this whole division did not do well, right? And then we also have subgroups that were performing even less than the average of all students. So we need to look at it from both perspectives because if everyone was doing poorly, why didn't everybody perform well? What could we have done differently or better so that there would be more progress made for every single student? And then the second part of it is how do we get those who fall behind up higher because they may have been further down originally but maybe they moved closer to where we want them to be but still haven't gotten to that point yet. So yeah, one of my things is going to be asking administration how much time these students actually got to spend with teachers."

      "gpt_response": "As a school board member, I've been closely monitoring our district's performance data, and while there are areas of excellence, it's concerning that some of our student groups continue to struggle. Our latest achievement gap report highlights persistent disparities in math proficiency rates between low-income students and their peers from more affluent backgrounds. Similarly, English language learners face significant hurdles in reading comprehension.\n\nIn my opinion, these gaps stem from systemic issues rather than any inherent lack of potential among these student populations. To address them effectively, we need to adopt a multifaceted approach.\n\nFirstly, professional development opportunities should focus on culturally responsive teaching practices and differentiated instruction techniques. This would enable teachers to better tailor their lessons to meet diverse learning needs.\n\nSecondly, we must prioritize resource allocation, ensuring equitable distribution of funds across schools serving predominantly disadvantaged communities. This could involve targeted investments in literacy coaches, after-school programs, or family engagement initiatives.\n\nThirdly, community partnerships hold immense value in supplementing academic support services. By forging collaborations with local non-profits, businesses, and social service agencies, we can provide wraparound services like tutoring, mentorship, and counseling – all aimed at mitigating external barriers that impede student success.\n\nLastly, accountability measures require adjustment as well",

      "monologue": "And I'm Graham Page, Samuel Miller district. a brief intro for our meeting this afternoon. Since March of 2020, Albemarle County Public Schools have faced unprecedented challenges in accomplishing its mission of establishing a community of learners and learning through relationships, relevance, and rigor, one student at a time. Our students, staff, and families have adapted to these challenges and changes with creativity, flexibility, and perseverance. Our teachers have continued to provide our students with a world-class education virtually. Our students have worked to master new skills on new learning platforms. Our families have helped to facilitate their children's virtual learning, becoming tech troubleshooters and tutors in addition to maintaining their normal day jobs. We remain grateful to them and proud of them for continuing their great work under difficult circumstances. While managing education amidst the uncertainties of a pandemic, Albemarle County Public Schools have simultaneously fought in the battle to end the predictive value of race and ensure the success of each individual student and staff member during a period of social unrest in our community and society. We have worked to eliminate the opportunity gap that exists in our division so that we can eradicate it and build a system that works for everyone in our strong and diverse community of learners. This work will help us all learn to understand difference and respect and champion the diverse life experiences of all members of our community. We are so grateful to the Virginia General Assembly for its support for public education both over the years, and doing the 2020 special session. We have seen how you make public education, a large part of the conversations that you have around legislation and funding. We know that you have made schools a priority during the pandemic crisis, and we have worked to do our part in keeping keeping our county public school community strong as we push through this unusual moment in time. A lot is being done to keep our county families strong. Our transportation and child nutrition departments have taken advantage of an FDA waiver that allows the county schools to deliver meals to our students. Every day, 7,000 meals are delivered to over 3,500 students by 62 buses. This ensures that our students have nutritious meals and an opportunity to engage with their schools. We've established a COVID-19 hotline that would allow us to provide any available resources to those in need during the pandemic. We're also expanding our mental health services, including training members of our staff in mental health first aid, so that we can help lift the emotional burden that COVID has caused in our community. Our extended day enrichment program mobilized to create a child care program for county employees, public school employees. Currently, there are more than 40 students enrolled in this program, and we are extending it as we further hope our school doors open to accommodate more of our employees. Over 1,000 hotspots have been provided to our students and employees in order to facilitate virtual learning for those who do not have reliable internet. These were provided at no cost to recipients. Our anti-racism policy steering committee has implemented a book study on Glenn Singleton's courageous conversations about race for our school board and leadership team members. This work will help us ensure that our educators can help the division eliminate the predictive value of race in our school division. Our four items in our 2021 legislative packet is aligned with all of these programs and with the work our division is doing. My colleagues will now speak on the subject of each of these four. We'll start with Mr. Alcaro, who will lead the discussion on social justice. Mr. Alcaro.",

        "We've had many challenges that we've faced over the past two years as part of COVID-19. I'll just give you an overview of some of those accomplishments and challenges that have occurred. But one thing we were very proud of is that we took advantage of every opportunity for funding that was provided to us through grants or other means to improve broadband connectivity throughout our county, which allowed all students to access virtual learning from their homes during the pandemic period. We also received additional funding that enabled us to hire more staff to provide support services like social emotional wellness and mental health supports to our students who really needed it during this time. And another accomplishment was our ability to maintain our graduation rates while still maintaining our rigorous academic standards. Some challenges included implementing mitigation strategies effectively, ensuring equity in resources, communication with families, and providing support services to our English language learners. In addition to working closely with our superintendent, the central office team, and teachers, I personally attended numerous town halls, listening sessions, and meetings with individual stakeholders to address concerns, answer questions, share information, and offer support. Our division's response to the challenges we encountered was truly collaborative, not only between different teams within the school system but also among local government agencies, non-profit organizations",
        "So we have had significant challenges in our division during the pandemic, but I'm also proud of what we've been able to accomplish too. One major challenge that comes right to mind is trying to keep kids safe and healthy while still providing good education for all of our students. We were one of the first divisions in Virginia to close down last year when this started happening. Our superintendent at the time was really proactive about it, and so as soon as there were two cases reported in Virginia, he closed us down immediately. And then that's when the real work began because we didn't know how long it would go on or anything else like that. But we were able to adapt pretty quickly into doing virtual learning, which was not something that most of us knew much about before. The technology department did an amazing job of getting everyone set up with laptops if they needed them and making sure teachers were trained in using digital tools and everything. It wasn't perfect, but it was definitely better than nothing. Another big accomplishment, even though it came from adversity, was how the whole community kind of came together around supporting those families who maybe weren't quite as well off. We partnered with lots of organizations in town to make sure people could get food if they",
        "Well, Dr. Haas, thank you for that nice introduction. To begin with, the pandemic obviously brought on a number of significant changes and challenges to our schools. For example, students were forced into virtual learning for almost an entire year. In addition, we had quite a few teachers who did not want to return to work when they could do it at home, so finding substitutes became another challenge. Then there was also all the health-related problems associated with COVID-19 like contact tracing, getting enough PPE supplies, trying to keep kids social distance, and making sure that any student or teacher showing symptoms would stay out of school until well again. We definitely got through those times thanks to staff working very hard and coming up with creative solutions. As time went forward, it then turned into keeping schools open safely while still following state guidelines for mitigation strategies. Throughout this whole ordeal though, I really must say that collaboration between administration, parents, students, and even teachers allowed us to pull off what seemed impossible and offer some semblance of normalcy during a very abnormal period in history. Thank you."

Our dedicated teachers adapted quickly, leveraging digital tools and creative instructional methods to maintain student engagement. This rapid adaptation allowed us to minimize educational gaps during an extremely challenging period.\n\nOne notable accomplishment is our ability to provide devices and internet access to every student who needed it. Through partnerships with local organizations and government agencies, we successfully bridged the technology gap for many families. As a result, all students had equal opportunities to participate in online classes, regardless of their socio-economic background or zip code.\n\nAnother highlight was implementing mental health support systems for both students and staff. Recognizing the immense emotional toll the pandemic took on everyone involved, we prioritized wellness initiatives, such as counseling services, mindfulness programs, and employee assistance hotlines. These efforts helped foster a supportive environment that acknowledged the complexities of teaching and learning during crisis times.\n\nHowever, these accomplishments didn't come without challenges.

But this is the governor's proclamation, where school principals work cooperatively to direct, develop, and inspire all members of the school staff and student body, and to communicate effectively with parents to engage them in the learning process. And whereas principals serve as educational leaders responsible for managing the policies, regulations and procedures necessary to ensure a safe and effective learning environment for all students in Virginia's public and private schools. And whereas principals and teachers are entrusted with the opportunity and the responsibility of guiding, directing, nurturing, mentoring, and imparting knowledge to our children while they are at school. And whereas principals must work collaboratively with teachers, staff, students, parents, and the community at large to proactively prepare students to be self-reliant and productive citizens. and whereas Virginia School Principals Appreciation Week is an opportunity to recognize the hard work of Virginia schools principals and to recognize the importance of principals in ensuring that every child has access to a quality education. Now, therefore, I, Ralph S. Northam, do hereby recognize January the 8th through 14th, 2022 as Virginia School Principal Appreciation Week in our Commonwealth of Virginia. And I call this observance to the attention of all of our citizens. So we do congratulate and extend our appreciation to all of our principals. And again, we really are pleased to have at least four of our principals attending tonight.",

        "OK, Mr. Harris, I can take that one if you want me too or Ms. Johnston could also talk about it. But in short, the Virginia School Principals Appreciation Week has been established by the General Assembly to recognize the significant role that our principals play in providing leadership for their schools, providing support for their teachers, staff and students, as well as promoting student success and academic achievement across the commonwealth. The week is usually celebrated in October each year and its main goal is just to show appreciation to those hardworking educators who work day in and day out with their dedicated team to ensure every child receives quality education. So basically we really should celebrate them because they're very important to us. And actually this time is used to encourage all stakeholders including parents, students, and community members to acknowledge the efforts of these outstanding leaders who make such a huge difference in so many lives and they truly have an impact on shaping future generations. Without effective leadership, which starts at the principal level, schools cannot function effectively. They work tirelessly behind the scenes often times dealing with challenging situations to provide not only education but also other supports that may be needed. Our principals work closely with central office administration along with school board members to develop strategic plans to improve",
        "OK, so first question that I believe was addressed to me from Ms. Bynum. Our answer, thank you for asking this question. The purpose of Virginia School Principal's appreciation week is really to honor the important role that those individuals play in leading their schools and supporting teachers, staff members, students, and families within the community. They make significant contributions to our education system here in Virginia because they're responsible for creating positive learning environments and implementing policies that foster student achievement and success. Principals serve as instructional leaders, managers, and facilitators who are instrumental in developing collaborative relationships with teachers and other stakeholders. They work diligently behind the scenes, often working long hours to support their schools and communities, and they deserve recognition and gratitude for all that they do. So we have appreciation weeks set aside specifically for them to recognize these dedicated professionals. And again, thank you for bringing up that point. It would not go unnoticed. Thank you very much.",

And I just want to start out saying how excited I am to have all of these people here tonight who are so dedicated to education. The purpose of Principal Appreciation Week is really to honor those hardworking individuals across our commonwealth who work tirelessly each day to support students, teachers, staff members, and parents in their schools. They serve as instructional leaders, administrative managers, and community builders, often behind-the-scenes but always focused on ensuring academic excellence and personal growth for every student. So we wanted to take time to acknowledge their invaluable contributions to Virginia's public education system."

Our principals not only oversee daily operations but also spearhead initiatives focused on enhancing student achievement, fostering collaborative learning environments, and providing guidance to teachers while addressing parental concerns.\n\nOne of their most significant contributions lies in creating an atmosphere conducive to academic success, often necessitating tough decision-making regarding resource allocation, staff development, and budget management – all critical aspects impacting students' overall growth. Furthermore, they serve as liaisons between educators, administrators, parents, and local communities, working diligently behind the scenes to ensure seamless communication and stakeholder engagement.\n\nIt's essential we acknowledge the substantial impact Virginia's school principals have on shaping our children's futures, thus celebrating them through events like Principals Appreciation Week offers a wonderful opportunity to demonstrate appreciation for their tireless efforts and commitment to the betterment of our collective educational landscape.\"",

Tonight, we are truly honored to have with us Mrs. Lucille Smith, who recently completed unforgettable and extensive history of Jackson P. Burleigh High School. Last year, the school was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In her preface, Ms. Smith wrote, Black History Matters. We must continue to document and preserve the rich and brave story of African-American students in Charlottesville City and Atmau County. Before readers open the book's first pages, Ms. Smith advises them that the interviews from students, faculty, and administrators are raw, candid, and from the heart. Her connections to segregated education includes her husband Rizal, who graduated from Burleigh High School in 1966. Rizal later served as chair of the Charlottesville City School Board. Ms. Smith grew up and attended school in North Little Rock, Arkansas, across the river from Little Rock Central High School, a place forever known for its role in bringing into national public consciousness the struggle for racial educational opportunity. unforgettable, the history of Burleigh is not a volume though about separate and unequal education in our community. It is instead a joyous celebration of remarkable young men and women whose time at Burleigh comes back in pages filled with personal reflections, copies of original documents and photos, and a long list of extraordinary achievements. It recounts a story that should be told again and again of how education teaches us perseverance, pride, and confidence, friendship, and the value of just plain hard work, and how together all of these gifts build strong families and careers and selfless and uplifting community service. Although she did not have the opportunity to attend Burleigh, the considerable talents of Ms. Smith as a historian and writer would convince you otherwise. She served for more than 30 years with the U.S. Army National Ground Intelligence Center. She now devotes much of her time as a volunteer to local boards and community organizations and to her church. I understand that our school division will be making copies of Unforgettable available to all of our schools, to all of our school libraries.

So we actually made some adjustments within the county so that they would allow more bandwidth, especially since it became known that we were gonna go back to virtual because again,  we didn't know if someone could come down with COVID at the last minute. And then they wouldn't want to participate physically either. But anyway, part of that includes testing all the equipment before hand. We also make sure that our agendas are posted out to the community, certainly on social media, which reaches far more people than just traditional print. The agenda is put up, the link is provided where people can join via Zoom. And then once they log onto Zoom, they need to provide their name and email address.

Additionally, we provide instructions on how to join the meeting, participate in Q&A sessions, and access supporting documents.\n\n\n\nThirdly, maintaining transparency demands proactive measures.

The feedback from parents and students has been overwhelmingly positive, and it's evident that their hard work is paying off.\n\nFurthermore, I'm thrilled to report that our district-wide initiative to promote STEM education through extracurricular programs has seen significant growth. We've witnessed an increase in student participation, particularly among underrepresented groups, which is truly heartening. This wouldn't have been possible without the collaborative efforts between our educators, local businesses, and community organizations.\n\nHowever, as we celebrate these successes, I also want to address concerns regarding the recent budget allocation meeting. While we managed to secure necessary funding for infrastructure development, I still have reservations about the proposed cuts to our arts program. In my opinion, creative outlets play a vital role in fostering well-rounded individuals, and I fear that reducing resources might hinder our students' ability to explore alternative avenues",

        "OK, thank you so much for asking this. As we know, since last year when the pandemic hit us, it has been imperative that all of us learn how to navigate in these difficult times, especially as far as communication goes within our community, staff members, teachers, parents, students. And I would say virtual meetings have really become a necessary tool. The state government gave guidelines, so what happened is in 2020 on March 12th, they allowed boards across Virginia to hold electronic meetings with no public attendance allowed due to health emergency declarations from both localities and states or governors. We've had training sessions provided by the Virginia School Boards Association. So, here's one piece of information: Our district must ensure equal access to participants who participate virtually and those who do physically attend if possible in person. If not, then we use Zoom and other digital tools like Google Meet.  Then number two is making sure that virtual attendees can hear or view any visual presentation presented at the same time as people attending the physical meeting, again, if we're able to meet in person, which sometimes isn't always possible. The third point is allowing public commenters also to present electronically their input through audio means, such as a live chat function",
        "OK, thank you so much for bringing up those questions because I know we have had some concerns from parents and staff about how these meetings work and what they look like. So first of all, as Dr. Haas said earlier, just prior to this meeting starting tonight, or maybe before our last regular meeting on January 14th, Ms. McLaughlin went over the procedure for public comment at the end of each board meeting. And we also gave directions on how citizens can make public comments and ask questions through email or phone call, even if it's not live with us right now. But again, when there is no live audience, there may be situations where it becomes necessary to hold an emergency virtual meeting, such as during the current pandemic, when holding in-person meetings would pose health risks to the community. In those cases, state law allows school boards to meet electronically using technology. However, Virginia code section 2.2-3708.1 outlines specific requirements for electronic participation in meetings. These include making sure that members of the public can participate remotely, including having access to audio and video feeds, providing notice of the meeting to the public, and ensuring that any votes taken virtually comply with state open meeting laws. Our attorney",
        "All right, Dr. Haas, could you repeat that last sentence one more time for us, please? OK. Right now we do not have any other questions on Zoom. Our next question is from Ms. Omeish who has already left, so I'm assuming she won't be able to make it tonight. And then we have another person asking about our policies regarding the upcoming school year and how they might impact student athletes who may decide to participate in those sports as opposed to taking part in distance learning or if that would affect their participation. So there's a question about that. We'll try to get an answer to that also. Another question was concerning the fact of when we were going to have this information out to students and families. As soon as possible after tonight's meeting, the administrative team would send out all necessary details on the return to school plan via email, including specific health mitigation strategies, attendance guidelines, transportation guidance, grading policy updates and expectations for remote instruction."

That means there would be no changes in terms of how long before posting a notice or anything like that. We would follow the same procedures as usual.

Also, the public has access through livestreaming so they can watch online or tune into Zoom if it were available,  also having an option of phone-in numbers where people could call in for any public comment. We would make sure that everyone who participates virtually follows the same rules that we do at an in-person meeting, such as respecting each other, not interrupting one another, waiting until you're recognized before speaking and so forth. And just to ensure everything goes smoothly, I believe we've had some technical training for staff members on how to use platforms like Zoom effectively, too.

For instance, instead of asking \"How do you feel about the new math curriculum?\", ask \"To what extent has the new math curriculum improved your understanding of algebra?\"\n\nSecondly, it's essential to include a mix of both quantitative and qualitative questions. Quantitative questions (e.g., \"On a scale of 1-5, how satisfied are you with the program?\") allow us to gather numerical data and identify trends. Qualitative questions (e.g., \"Can you describe an instance where the program positively impacted your learning experience?\"), on the other hand, provide valuable insights into individual experiences and opinions.\n\nThirdly, we should strive to minimize bias by avoiding leading or loaded questions. Phrasing is critical; avoid using language that might influence respondents' answers. For example, rather than asking \"Don't",

And to sort of update all of our board members, an elected school board, such as here in Albemarle County, may pay each of its members an annual salary that is consistent with the salary of procedures and no more than the salary limits provided for by local government bodies. The school board has adopted the procedure currently used by the Board of Supervisors in setting its member salary pursuant to Virginia Code section 15.2, 1414-3. Specifically, the school board will establish the member's salary by affirmative vote annually between May 1st and June 20th, or 30th rather. Before setting a salary each year, the board is required to hold a public hearing and provide notice as specified by Virginia Code Section 15-2, 1426 and 1427. If the salary increase is approved by an affirmative vote, then the increase will take effect on July 1st. Currently our school board members receive an annual salary of $6,907. The current chairman's stipend is an additional $1,800 annually, and the vice chairman receives a stipend of $35 per meeting chair. Typically, the school board increases its salary by the same increase provided to classified staff. If the board follows the same increase as classified, then the salary beginning July 1st, 2021 would be $7,183. So what we need to do in a motion tonight would be to direct the board clerk to advertise for public hearing a school board member salary of $7,183 with a chairman stipend of 1,800 and a vice chairman stipend of $35 per meeting chair.

        "OK, thank you so much for that great question.  So the process for determining the salaries of school board members here in Albemarle County actually begins with an annual budget process where we receive recommendations from both Dr. Haas and the superintendent regarding various aspects of our budget, including compensation for all employees, including School Board members. The School Board as part of that process would then consider these salary proposals within the context of other budgetary priorities during the development of its overall budget proposal. Any proposed changes to School Board member salaries would also need to be approved through this same budget adoption process and ultimately approved by the Albemarle County Board of Supervisors. If approved, those adjustments would take effect on July 1st following approval of the county's fiscal year budget. And just one last little tidbit, our salaries at present are $250 per month and have remained unchanged since I believe back in about 2014 or so. Thank you very much.",
        "Thank you so much for that question about our salary-setting process for school board members here within Albemarle County.  The Virginia General Assembly sets a cap on the maximum compensation allowed to school boards per division within the state based upon the average daily attendance of the schools within those divisions. So currently for us as a larger school division in category five, which is over 10,000 students, we have a range from $3,500 up to $20,000 annually. And it's interesting because some years ago when I first came onto the board, there was actually no compensation at all. We got zero dollars for serving on the school board. But since then, we've gradually increased it to keep pace with inflationary costs associated with doing this work. Now, in terms of setting the actual dollar amount locally, it's set through an annual budget cycle by our board itself, although always staying below that state-established ceiling. It involves consideration of factors such as local economic conditions, other public officials' salaries, plus past practices as well. Any changes must occur through open meetings and ultimately receive majority approval before they're put into place. There haven't been recent increases specifically but if we were ever to consider them, it would certainly involve",
        "OK, thank you so much, Vice Chair Carlson.  So the salary for School Board members, it's set by state code. It can't be changed without going through the General Assembly in Richmond to actually change that code or law. But locally, we do have some discretion on what percentage we're paid out of the maximum amount allowed. And right now, I believe we get about 80% of that maximum amount which is $25,000 this year. In terms of raises, historically they've been tied to teacher raises. We try to keep them aligned with those because teachers are really at the heart of our education system. If there aren't sufficient funds available in the budget, though, sometimes the county does take that into account when they make recommendations to us. But usually again, if the raise is given to teachers then we would also receive the same percentage increase. But ultimately, the decision has to come from our local governing body, which is the supervisors in terms of providing enough money within our overall budget to cover such an increase. Thank you."

This helps establish a baseline for fair compensation. Next, they consider factors such as our locality's cost-of-living index, median household income, and the overall budget constraints facing our schools.\n\nOnce this data is compiled, the information gets presented to us during one of our regular meetings. As board members, we discuss these findings among ourselves, taking into account input from various stakeholders like parents, teachers, and community leaders.\n\nRegarding salary increases, those decisions usually occur annually as part of our budget deliberations. We carefully weigh requests against competing priorities within the education system – things like teacher raises, new programs, or facility upgrades. Any proposed increase must demonstrate clear value added to the educational experience or justify itself through significant changes in our workload or responsibilities.\n\nIn practice, most increases come about due to either (1) shifts in the regional market rate or (2) additional duties assigned to the board.",

Secondly, members of the public wishing to provide public comment during the school boards meeting may sign up online at our website by 4pm the day before the meeting, the clerk will email zoom links to the speakers on the day of the meeting, so that they can log into the meeting to provide comment. Before electronic public comment commences, the vice chair will announce the order in which the speakers will comment. Public commenters will initially be admitted to a waiting room area on Zoom until it is their turn to speak. There, they'll be able to hear the meeting in progress while they wait. Each speaker's access to public comment will be activated when it is that speaker's turn to provide comment to the members of the school board. The speakers will be notified when they reach the two-minute mark. And at the three-minute mark, the speaker's Zoom link will be automatically deactivated. Although the school board is confident that public comment will proceed in an orderly and respectful manner, upon instruction from the chair, the clerk has the ability to disconnect a speaker who is disruptive, profane, or fails to abide by these guidelines. Speakers during the meeting or those submitting written comment should state name and address or magisterial district. Simply stating Albemarle County is not adequate. The school board will not respond to comments made during the public comment period. School board members may address comments at the end of the meeting agenda under other business. And tonight we have five speakers. They will speak in this order. Vernon Leichty, Murray Sekalski, whose name I butchered, Kevin Owen, Amy Gardner, and Cheryl Knight. Those are our five speakers for tonight. Ms. Johnson.",

        "Thank you very much, Ms. Carlson. Public comments are an essential part of our school board meeting process. Our policy allows us to have individuals make public comment. During this pandemic, we've had to adjust that slightly so we can accommodate people's ability to do it safely from their homes or any other location. So if they'd like to provide a public comment for tonight's meeting, they would need to send those via email  by today no later than 4 pm, with publiccomment@acps.k12.va.us being the address that they should use. And then we'll read them aloud during our public comment portion of tonight's agenda. That way, we're still honoring their right to speak before us but also ensuring everyone's safety by doing that virtually rather than having folks come out here to the building itself. Any questions on that particular item? Thank you. Yeah, Ms. Carlson.",
        "The procedure is really that we have two options to give input, either through Zoom or you can do it in person. In person means coming into the conference center. For those who opt-in, if they're going on Zoom, then their audio would come through loud and clear so everyone could hear them just as though they were physically present here.  If someone wants to make some kind of written comment rather than an oral one, there's also a possibility that they could send it via email, but again, we need more guidance from our attorney about whether we could read all those aloud at the meeting because sometimes what happens with emails is that people get very lengthy, and I'm not sure how practical it would be to share that information verbally when other ways might work better like sharing it online where everybody could look at it afterwards. But Ms. Johnston has shared she said there was some additional resources related to open meetings law which may help us further clarify this process. So does Dr. Haas want to add anything else? Or should I go ahead and address Mr. Oberg? Okay.",
        "All right, so just to make sure that we're clear on this process for everyone's benefit because I know we have some folks who maybe haven't been able to attend one of our virtual school board meetings yet or at least not recently attended any, So our chair had indicated, again, about 30 minutes before tonight's meeting began to sign up if you wanted to do public comment either virtually or in person. And then those individuals would actually get three minutes to speak either through Zoom or from their seat down here on the floor. Now, in terms of speaking virtually, please keep in mind that when it is your turn to speak, you should unmute yourself using the mute button within zoom or on your device. Additionally, just as an FYI, since this is also being broadcast live on Facebook Live, there could be a slight delay between what you say and when others see or hear you over livestreaming. Our school board clerk is the timekeeper tonight, and she'll give you notice when you're running low on your three-minute allotment. If anyone needs assistance with unmuting themselves, we've got technical support staff available to help out tonight. Are there other questions related to the procedure itself? We need to go ahead"

Currently, our district is following social distancing guidelines and limiting gatherings to minimize exposure risks. \n\nTo facilitate public comments safely, we've implemented virtual participation options for school board meetings. Here's how it works: members of the public can submit written statements or video recordings up to 24 hours before the meeting via email or an online portal on our website. This allows us to review submissions beforehand and prepare responses if needed. \n\nFor those who prefer live commentary, we're offering real-time virtual commenting through Zoom conferencing software. Participants need to register their names and contact information ahead of time so we can moderate the session effectively. During the meeting, attendees can unmute themselves when recognized by the chairperson to share their thoughts within the allotted three-minute timeframe per speaker. \n\nIt's essential for me as a school board member to strike a balance between keeping everyone safe and allowing our community to engage meaningfully in decision-making processes.

      "monologue": "I have an announcement. Thank you, Mr. O'Carroll. It is not possible today to turn to a radio or TV or website or to pick up a newspaper without reading about the very best in our country. Every day we are learning about those who had great personal risk and sacrifice of putting the interests of others ahead of their own. What would we do without them. It is one of life's great ironies that in times of tragedy that our community best learns about those who routinely dedicate their lives to the service of others. We admire those on the front lines of our hospitals, clinics, and medical offices. We are grateful for their courage and their selfless dedication. I want to tell you about another such hero who comes from a different place. A recent NPR story was about a student in another part of the country who said about her educator, and I quote, she wasn't just concerned about me getting good grades. She was concerned about me being a good human being in life. She would always ask me how my mom is doing because my mom was kind of sick. Things like that she didn't have to do because it wasn't school related. She built my confidence up because I was so insecure about being smart, or the skills that I wanted to have, or the goals that I wanted in life. I could always hear her telling me, you belong here.\" End of quote. The student went on to say how in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, she reached for her phone to text a message, and how she stopped in mid-sentence, realizing she would not get a reply. Her friend, the teacher, was among the hundreds of educators across this country who had lost their lives to COVID-19. Here in Albemarle County, we know about the contributions our teachers make in the classroom every day of the school year. We know about their creativity, the determination, the passion, and the joy of our educators bringing to the lives of our children. We measure that on tests and examinations. We calculate that in our graduation rates. We celebrate that in the academic awards our students earn. And even tonight with the three young ladies that we heard. Less visible, but deeper in value, more life-changing is what is not captured by a number. It is revealed in the comments of the student in the NPR story, in the self-esteem, confidence, friendship, trust, and kindness she gained from an educator. As a teacher for 24 years with Albemarle County Public Schools, I had the privilege of working next to hundreds and hundreds of educators who provided these gifts to the students. Here's what one of our parents in the midst of the current COVID-19 crisis wrote on Facebook. And again, I quote, with joy to listen to my fourth grader talk to his fabulous teacher. It is hard to tell who is more enthusiastic. I know this time away from students is soul crushing for teachers who've dedicated their lives to educating our children. Thank you all that the faculty and staff are doing to keep us connected. End of quote. This past week was Teacher Appreciation Week across our nation, and one week from this evening, we will be celebrating teachers who have received a Golden Apple Award. They are excited to serve students and families. In fact, the past few weeks have been a time to honor many of those who unselfishly serve our students and their families. They included Assistant Principals Day, National Library Week, Student Leadership Week, Administrative Professionals Day, National Physical Education Week, Principals Day, National Music Week, and School Nurses Day. Normally, each of these occasions would feature special programs and activities. And while the public health restrictions in place to protect us from COVID-19 make this anything but a normal time, they do not diminish the everyday accomplishments and attributes of these highly dedicated and extraordinary professionals. So in light of that I would like to make a motion that our board expresses its deepest appreciation to our teachers, administrators and staff, but they're exceptional public service, and for being so important to the success of our students and families to our school division and county, and to our together. Are you on mute, Mr. O'Carroll? I just took myself off of mute.",

To our educators, administrators, and staff, who work tirelessly day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year, in the pursuit of academic excellence for every single student within our school system, there are simply no words adequate enough to express the depth of gratitude and appreciation that each and every one of us feels towards you. You truly are the backbone of this organization, working diligently behind the scenes often times without recognition or accolades but always giving above and beyond what is ever required of you.

        "Okay, thank you for asking that question.  So just to clarify, as part of the Board of Education we do have a strategic plan goal related to closing opportunity gaps. And I think it would probably be helpful if perhaps someone from central office or administration could give us an update at some point about how they're working towards achieving those goals and what kind of progress has been made so far because it is a big priority for all of us. But to address the other part of your question related to Dr. Harrison's leadership, certainly he was hired based on his qualifications but also his experience with respect to addressing issues of diversity and inclusion. Now one thing I want to make sure people understand is that this process is not something that started when Dr. Harrison arrived here. We had already set up a committee back in October, 2018 before Dr. Haas left and that included several different community members, teachers, parents, administrators. The purpose was really two fold. One was to get input from stakeholders across the county regarding how best to support our students who were experiencing achievement gaps which include many of our minority groups but also students with disabilities. It wasn't limited to race. And then secondly, it was looking into how we can better",
        "Okay, thank you very much for that presentation. And then Mr. Johnson. All right, so now is there anything else under other business from any board members or the superintendent?  I guess we have been through pretty well what was mentioned with those presentations.",
        "OK, so my main concerns for the equity initiative would be really what is it that we're actually doing to implement this whole idea of making sure every student has equal access or opportunities to learn.  So I'm hoping that when they get ready to present us with whatever plan they have that there'll be specific goals established along with measurable objectives as well as timelines for achieving these objectives because if you don't have those things then really all you've got is just talk about an issue but no real action taking place. And then again, also considering whether or not certain programs should have been in place already that aren't. There's one thing right now called \"AVID\" (Advancement Via Individual Determination) which was initially started at Tabb High School where students were taught college preparatory courses, etcetera, helping them develop study skills and things like that. That program did move to other schools within York County but I believe they stopped using AVID. The other aspect could be more summer programs, having more after-school programs for tutoring and such things. So while equity may help level the playing field somewhat, you can still use different approaches without calling everything under some type of umbrella term. But definitely, specifics must be presented before any"

      "gpt_response": "I must say that I have been quite impressed with Dr. Harrison's vision for the equity program, particularly his focus on addressing the disparities in academic achievement among different student demographics within our district. As a board member, it is crucial that we prioritize initiatives that promote inclusivity and provide equal opportunities for all students, regardless of their background or zip code.\n\nThat being said, I do believe there is still much work to be done to ensure its successful implementation. From my perspective, effective communication between administrators, teachers, and parents is vital in creating an environment where every student feels valued and supported. While Dr. Harrison has made strides in engaging with various stakeholders, I would like to see more concrete strategies put forth to tackle some of the systemic barriers hindering student success.\n\nOne area of concern for me lies in ensuring adequate resources reach those schools most in need. Our data indicates significant funding gaps exist across different regions of the district, which undoubtedly perpetuate existing inequalities. To truly move the needle on equity, I firmly believe we must allocate resources more thoughtfully and strategically.\n\nMoving forward, I plan to collaborate closely with Dr. Harrison and other key players to guarantee that our commitment to equity translates into tangible results for all students in our care.",

        "Well, all right, thank you very much for that question. So currently we have been holding virtual meetings. We started this back in March of last year as an emergency measure because of COVID-19.  And we've continued on since then, although recently we've had some conversations about moving forward into hybrid models or other ways of doing things. But at present time, all of our board meetings are being held virtually via zoom. There are multiple reasons why we did that initially, but one was because we didn't want people gathering together in close proximity and potentially spreading the virus, but also so we could ensure that we were able to maintain continuity of government while keeping everyone safe. And I really believe that's what we need to continue focusing on right now.  As far as concerns go regarding conducting business over Zoom, there's several points I'd like to make. First off, we're still having open public sessions. It doesn't matter whether it's virtual or not. You know, any member of the public can attend our meeting and speak during those times if they would like to do so. So accessibility hasn't changed in terms of attending a meeting. What has changed perhaps is just how you get to the meeting itself. Another thing",

And I guess there were some issues early on where some people didn't have access to internet or devices that would allow them to participate fully in those meetings. So for right now, we're going to continue meeting virtually as long as the health director advises us it's necessary. And what else can I say about this topic? I believe also at the last board meeting, we discussed considering if we could go back into person when certain numbers come down, but until then, we're sticking with virtual meetings for safety reasons. And another thing is that Mr. McLaughlin mentioned earlier that we could take an informal poll at every other week at the beginning of each month. That way, everyone could get more comfortable with using Zoom and understanding exactly how things work within these digital platforms like Zoom.",
        "OK, thank you for that. Currently, the School Board is still meeting virtually via Zoom because of COVID-19 restrictions on gatherings.  So we're following all those guidelines set out by our state government as well as other local health officials who have provided us some advice on this matter. And while I know there's certainly been frustration around having to conduct virtual sessions instead of being able to meet in person, it's just not safe enough at this point.

It's not an exaggeration to say that decisions they make often have a greater long-term impact on our communities than those of any other elected body at any other level of government. You brought these words to life when you helped to lead a community town hall examining the life-threatening risk of COVID-19, most especially the equal medical care and services provided to communities of color. The expert panel you brought together included state and local officials and a large online audience. Your role in that event and your leadership on the Student Equity Advisory Council ensured that you have indeed had a great impact on our communities. Your discussion of structural racism, from the point of view of a student now widely shared across the division as part of our anti racism orientation for all employees did indeed deliver a community value into our schools. Your willingness to offer insightful perspectives on such highly consequential decisions on the safest and most effective learning environments for students and staff proves the wisdom of student representation on our board. Repeatedly, you have contributed to the establishment of a direct link between ACPS students and the elected body that governs them, and for that we are all grateful. There is no lack of definition for what makes a good leader. One of my favorites is that a good leader is thoughtful, inclusive, dependable, generous to others, and eager to provide them with opportunities to shine. It's exactly how you were described to us and how you will be described to the next organization fortunate to benefit from your service. Thank you for making us better. Best wishes for a successful year at Albemarle. And to you and your family, please continue to stay safe. Respectively, Graham Page, Chair. Angel, we appreciate so much what you've done for us.",

        "Thank you so much for everything that you've brought to us this year, both from your perspective as well as just being an amazing young lady, thank you very much for all you have done with the school board this year, I appreciate it.  Thank you.",
        "Thank you so much for giving me an opportunity, Angel, I just want to thank you for all of your hard work that you have done this year with us on the school board. It has been my pleasure to get to know you better as we've worked together through some pretty challenging times, but also some really wonderful accomplishments within our division. And I want to commend you again, too, not only for representing the students from our county at large, which is quite an honor unto itself, but then for being such a strong advocate for equity and social justice issues, and always pushing us to look beyond the surface level into what's going on. So I'm grateful for that and appreciate how open-minded and receptive you were during your time serving here on the board. Would there be anything else before moving onto public comment or closing comments? Or do we go ahead with the one more item? Are there any other comments prior to this last motion? Thanks. Yeah, yeah, please proceed. Thank you very much. The motion carries, thanks everyone. Thank you. Is there anything else before public commentary starts tonight? So there won't be. Okay, so there'll be no closing remarks at the end. We're going to actually cut it",
        "Okay, thank you, Ms. McLaughlin. And I do hope that we have already spoken about an appropriate way to honor this young person for all they've done. But maybe Dr. Kari Miller has mentioned that she's going through COVID-19 and will not be able to make it today. So if there is any kind of small ceremony or anything that could happen later on, even when she graduates from high school, since she won't be with us here tonight. But what a pleasure it was to work alongside her and see how well prepared and informed and poised that girl was every single time she came before this board. Just really outstanding. Thanks again to her family as well for supporting her because it took a lot of effort to take up those responsibilities while still being a regular student. Thank you very much. OK. Is there any other one thing that I should know concerning student reps that we need to consider now moving forward after that information, Mr. Vash? I didn't get my microphone unmuted properly at first. Yeah. Any other thoughts or concerns about student reps?  Do we have a current list of names? No. All right, thanks so much.

Your dedication, passion, and commitment to representing the voice of students have been truly inspiring.\n\nAs I reflect on your time serving on the board, I'm reminded of the numerous occasions when you brought a unique perspective to our discussions, often shedding light on issues that might have otherwise gone unnoticed. Your ability to articulate complex ideas and advocate for policies that benefit all students has been remarkable.\n\nOne particular aspect that stands out is how you seamlessly bridged the gap between the student body and the administration. By fostering open communication channels and encouraging collaboration, you helped create an environment where everyone felt heard and valued.\n\nYour leadership skills have grown significantly over these past few years, and it's clear that you're destined for great things.

And probably about two weeks ago, there was a parent special training session. And in order to get one of the panelists for that training session, Ms. Early was on her way to her beauticians. And I think she stopped in the parking lot and found a phone number for this person that was either in Virginia Beach or in Illinois. And she called the person, introduced herself to that person, and said that she wanted them to be on her panel. So once Ms. Early is on your trail, it's really hard to sort of say no to her. So we really thank you so very much for everything that you've done for our students. We thank you, instructors. And I think some of the parents, like Mr. Green, might have been online tonight, too. So we also thank them. So thank you so very, very much, Ms. Early, for what you've done for our students and for Nesby.",

        "Well, I don't know if all of you remember it but last year we had this whole pandemic situation where we went into the virtual learning model and there was just so much confusion, so many questions. And really the teachers were having to learn how to do this stuff on the fly too because they hadn't done it before either. So when I got an email from one parent who said thank you for getting my child engaged again, she mentioned Ms. Early. She said she was always willing to take those extra steps even when things didn't work out as planned like with technical issues that sometimes happen during live sessions and Zoom classes. But the thing that really stuck out to me is the mom saying how grateful she was that Ms. Early checked up on them frequently making sure that their Wi-Fi connection at home was working okay, not knowing whether or not they would have internet access because they lived in rural areas. It really stood out to me that even though we were struggling through something that none of us had ever experienced before, she still managed to go above and beyond for these kids. And then another time Ms.  Early reached out to the family after noticing the student was absent multiple days due to transportation challenges related to car trouble and ended up",
        "All right, so one time when I was at the talent show and she had two students who were performing there with disabilities. One of them needed special assistance in order for him to perform. And what impressed me about Ms. Early is how involved she was making sure that this child got up on stage safely, ensuring his safety while he performed.  In other words, they made certain that all equipment would accommodate his needs during performance. It wasn't just getting ready for those kids to get on stage but also afterwards, the way she celebrated their success like it was hers as well because you could tell she was very proud of these children. And that's not even mentioning the hard work she put into training each kid individually before reaching the final show date, showing she truly cares for every single student under her guidance. The fact that both performances went amazingly shows that all that effort paid off really nicely. But again, it's more than just what we saw from the audience, such as taking care after the event or seeing if everything went okay afterwords too. You know that Ms. Early isn't someone who only looks forward, which makes her stand out compared to many teachers out there today.",
        "I would say one experience stands out that shows the level of care she had for each student was when there were two girls in my class who did not have enough money to buy their lunch, so Ms. Early took those girls to get pizza slices from somewhere because they didn't have any money."
      ],
      "gpt_response": "As I reflect on my time working alongside Ms. Early, there is one particular anecdote that stands out in my mind as a testament to her unwavering dedication and commitment to her students. It was during our district-wide literacy initiative, where we were striving to improve reading comprehension scores among our elementary school students. \n\nMs. Early took it upon herself to develop an after-school book club specifically designed for struggling readers. She spent countless hours researching relevant literature, creating engaging lesson plans, and even went so far as to provide transportation for those students who lacked access to reliable rides home afterwards. What struck me most about this endeavor was how she made sure each student felt seen and heard throughout the entire process - whether it was through personalized feedback sessions or simply being present at every single meeting. The impact of her efforts soon became apparent when many of these same students began showing marked improvement not just in their reading abilities but also in their confidence levels overall.  \n\nAnother notable instance that showcases Ms. Early's exceptional character was when a family within our community faced unexpected hardship due to unforeseen medical expenses. Without hesitation, Ms. Early rallied her colleagues and organized a fundraising campaign that raised over $5,000 for the affected family. This selfless act spoke volumes",

Because of the pandemic, we are required to read this statement into our minutes. The minutes of this meeting should reflect that this meeting is being held electronically, pursuant to Virginia state law and Albemarle County ordinance, because the COVID-19 pandemic makes it impracticable and unsafe to assemble a quorum physically in a single location. The meeting is being communicated to the public electronically through Zoom and streamed live on the Albemarle County Public Schools website. And public comment may be offered through the Zoom waiting room feature in accordance with the school board's protocol or by written submission. And also tonight we have another statement that we hope our listeners will be aware of and adhere to. I'd like to quote from a paragraph that is in our policy on school community relations. It says in part, the school board recognizes the public has vast resources of training and experience. And I add perspectives that are useful to schools. The strength of our school system is in the degree to which these resources are tapped in an advisory way. And these resources are involved in supporting the improvement of our educational program. Broad and diverse community engagement with the work of the board and the school division is so important that its value is expressly stated in the policy. Everyone is encouraged to offer their ideas, judgments, concerns, and questions about how well the school division is serving the needs of students and contributing to the health, safety, and economic prosperity of our community. The live streaming of school board meetings office of that valuable opportunity to benefit from the voices of more parents, students, employees and community partners. Since the pandemic participation in school board meetings often has gone from less than 25 people to more than 1000. We'd like to build on this growing community interest. Beginning this evening, those who accessed our live stream link will be offered a brief survey that will help us to expand our community outreach and contributions. Please take a few minutes to help with this goal. So if you are listening to our meeting, please take that opportunity at the end of the meeting, at the end of this session.

Our agenda tonight is actually a pretty packed one so we're going to try to stay on schedule as closely as possible. First off, before beginning with any comments or any discussion related to this evening's items, again, just a few reminders because of COVID-19 that we want to make sure that everybody stays safe at least while they are here. So all participants who have signed up for public comment must sign in using their name and email address when checking into the Zoom webinar before joining the call. If someone has technical issues during the session and loses connectivity or connection, simply rejoin the webinar if needed, but do not share your login information with others. And then finally, members of the public attending through zoom should ensure that their microphones are muted throughout the meeting unless recognized by me or Mr. Acuff for public comment periods. So, thank you for doing those things, which really help us keep track of everything and keep it moving along smoothly. Now, just another reminder about the way our meetings work.

And I do want to say thanks so much for those who are participating here tonight in person or virtually. We really appreciate that. At each regular meeting, we need to remind folks about some procedural items because they have changed since COVID-19 came upon us. So let me just give a little background. This is being held as both an in-person meeting and virtual one through Zoom at least currently until the end of this calendar year. The division has made arrangements with Zoom to continue using its platform for hybrid meetings during the entire fall season. You can access all information related to this meeting on our website under School Board, including agendas and materials and minutes after approval. Also note that any member of the public wishing to speak during citizen comment periods should sign up ahead of time electronically following directions provided via email when we sent out the notice for the meeting or use the QR code on the back wall which many of you may see from where you're sitting right now if you happen to be physically present.
