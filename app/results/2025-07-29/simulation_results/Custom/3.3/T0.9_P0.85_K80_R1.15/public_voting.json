    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.3: Technology Plan - The board will review a proposal to expand digital learning access by providing Chromebooks to every high school student. This initiative is estimated to cost $10,000 annually for devices, maintenance, and licensing. The program is designed to ensure equitable access to technology, support blended learning, and prepare students with digital skills for college and career readiness.. Who would like to start?"

  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thank you, grahampaige. I just want to start out by saying that I think it's fantastic we're having this conversation about ensuring all our high school students have equal access to technology. So many of them don't have the luxury at home. Guided by data and equity, my concern initially was looking at the annual cost estimate. We talk about this being ten thousand dollars per year. Could we get some clarification on how that breaks down? What percentage goes towards device purchases versus ongoing maintenance, et cetera? Uh, I'm wondering because we've got some students whose families can't afford the internet connection fee each month, so I want to make sure we factor those costs into our planning too. Have we explored options around"

    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Kate Acuff, thank you very much. Dr. McLaughlin, could you provide some additional information regarding these estimates and what all they cover?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Okay, before Dr. McLaughlin jumps in, um, Kate, I just wanna piggyback off your concerns about, uh, equity. You mentioned, rightly so, that some of our families struggle with even affording internet connectivity at home. And, I mean, we can't assume that every household has... has Wi-Fi, right? That's a huge assumption. Can we explore, maybe, partnerships with local organizations or companies that might be willing to help subsidize or offset those costs for our most vulnerable populations? Maybe there's a way to bundle services, you know, through a district-wide agreement? Just throwing that out there. Go ahead, Dr. McLaughlin."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I appreciate both comments from Ms. Cuff and Mrs. Osborne. I completely agree, equity should always guide us. One thing I'd love for staff is perhaps an update on where we are currently in terms of the number of students that don't have reliable access to technology outside of the classroom setting. How does this program then address that gap?  Would we be offering low-cost internet options for our families that don't have access? Or partnering up with internet providers to offer those discounts, as you mentioned, Ellen? If we're gonna invest in one-to-one devices, that assumes you've got a place to plug in and charge it when you go home. I also wonder, especially given our goal around environmental sustainability, whether these new devices"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Yeah, Katrina, I totally agree, we need to understand that landscape better. Um, Dr. McLaughlin, can you give us some updated numbers on, you know, exactly how many kids are struggling without tech access at home? Like, what's the scope of this issue? And then, yeah, building on Katrina's question, have we looked into... I know we've talked about this before, but, uh, partnering with internet service providers to offer discounted rates for our families in need? You know, something along those lines? Because, I mean, it's great we're giving them devices, but if they can't use 'em at home, what's the point, right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Respectfully, I want to jump in here, particularly with regard to the notion of balancing idealism with pragmatism. While I applaud the effort behind this proposal, uh, I do share some concerns expressed earlier. It seems to me that while providing Chromebooks to every high schooler addresses the technology gap within schools, it doesn't necessarily solve the bigger picture \u2013 internet accessibility once they leave campus. Now, I hear you, Ellen, proposing partnerships with local orgs, which sounds reasonable. But I still think we need more concrete plans laid out on how to tackle this issue head-on. We must consider the potential unintended consequences of sending kids home with devices knowing full well they won't be able to fully utilize them due to lack of internet"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "David, I, uh, totally get where you're coming from, you know? Pragmatism vs idealism, and all that. But, I mean, shouldn't we, like, take this opportunity to try and fix the whole puzzle, not just one piece of it? I know it's complicated, but if we don't attempt to find solutions for these kids who can't access internet at home, aren't we kinda missing the mark? I mean, yes, we gotta be realistic, but we also gotta be forward-thinking, you know? And what about, uh, exploring public-private partnerships? Could we work with local businesses, libraries, community centers, to create hotspots or safe spaces for these kids to access the internet"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "With respect to history and context, Ellen, I, uh, truly admire your enthusiasm and commitment to finding comprehensive solutions. However, balancing idealism with pragmatism, we cannot forget that our primary responsibility lies in providing quality education within the confines of our institution. Yes, certainly, we should strive to facilitate better outcomes beyond the school gates. Nonetheless, let's acknowledge that addressing internet accessibility at home involves navigating complex systemic issues. Perhaps we can explore possibilities for designated computer labs or library extensions within our existing infrastructure. In doing so, we'll cater specifically to students lacking reliable internet connections. By taking incremental steps, we can demonstrate a tangible impact. Always keeping in mind our focus on fairness and inclusion, shall we consider alternative strategies that benefit the majority"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Okay, okay, I see what you're saying, David. I really do. But, I mean, isn't that kind of, um, settling, you know? Providing computer labs or library extensions, that's great, don't get me wrong, but it's still a Band-Aid solution, right? We're not tackling the root cause of the problem. And, I know, I know, you said we gotta prioritize our institutional responsibilities, but, I mean, can't we think outside the box here? Shouldn't we aim higher than just, you know, patchwork fixes? I'm not saying it's easy, but... uh... can we at least explore, you know, creative ways to partner with local government"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "With respect to history and context, Ellen, I, uh, I absolutely understand your passion for seeking comprehensive solutions. And, I mean, I agree, aiming higher is precisely what we should do. My hesitation stems from the imperative to strike a balance between idealism and pragmatism. It's crucial we avoid overpromising and underdelivering, especially to our most vulnerable constituents. Having said that, I am committed to fairness and inclusion, and I concur that merely providing computer labs or library extensions alone wouldn't suffice. Exploring innovative collaborations with local government agencies, community organizations, or private entities to bridge the digital divide could yield positive results. I propose we task our administration to research and present viable partnership models, focusing on the feasibility"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Right. So, I appreciate, um, the points made by, uh, Kate Acuff, and Ellen, and David Oberg. And I do believe that, I mean, we need to look at the total package, not just handing out devices. So, um, I would support, uh, further exploration, you know, of our partnerships and agreements and arrangements to ensure that, I mean, our kids have internet access. And I think, uh, I do agree with David, though, that we, I mean, we can't promise everything everywhere, but we can make strides in the right direction. And, um, yeah, I guess my final thought would be, I hope we remember, you know, that these conversations"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Ah, thank you, Dr. McLaughlin. I think we're having a really important discussion here. Uh, I just wanted to build upon, uh, some of the points made by Kate and Ellen and David. I think we all recognize that, guided by equity and social justice, we need to consider the entire ecosystem, not just the device itself. I mean, we're talking about access, affordability, and, ultimately, bridging the digital divide. \n\nNow, I understand David's caution about, uh, pragmatism versus idealism, but I firmly believe that we should strive for, you know, systemic change rather than just Band-Aid solutions. And, Ellen, I love your idea about, uh, public-private"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thank you, Judy. I appreciate your acknowledgement. I wanted to follow up because, I mean, I totally agree with David's reservations regarding scalability and feasibility, which is why I asked initially about looking into local partners to possibly offset internet connectivity costs. It's wonderful that we provide devices, but that means little if homes lack a connection. I was hoping we could discuss further how our administration envisions helping bridge this specific gap. Are there talks underway or scheduled with local ISPs?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Yeah, Kate, I totally get it, and I think we're all on the same page here. I mean, we can't just stop at devices, right? We gotta think about, uh, the whole picture. And, yeah, local partners, ISPs, whatever - we need to explore all avenues. I'm sure Dr. McLaughlin will, uh, look into that and report back to us. Maybe we can even, you know, schedule a workshop or something to, uh, dive deeper into the specifics. I just wanna reiterate, though, that we can't lose sight of our ultimate goal: making sure every kid has equal opportunities, regardless of their zip code or socioeconomic status. That's, I mean, that"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "If I might interject real quick, Dr. McLaughlin, did we actually get an update on current numbers, you know, how many kids struggle with tech access at home? I'd love to revisit that since we seem to be circling around this topic."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Just before moving ahead, I did have one question. The first time when we discussed it, Dr. Rosa mentioned getting updated figures on internet access amongst our student population. Kate had brought that up again, and I'd love to request those statistics, please. Is that available tonight? Can you give us an overview of where things stand currently?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Absolutely, Katrina. Um, I completely forgot we were waiting on those updates, so I appreciate your diligence. I'd love to hear, uh, those fresh stats too. Would be incredibly helpful, you know, as we deliberate on potential paths forward. I've always emphasized guided by data and equity, so let's, uh, put ourselves in position to make informed choices. Dr. McLaughlin, if you could share where we stand now with those statistics?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "I appreciate, uh, the collective wisdom being shared around this table. As we navigate the complexities of equitable internet access, I want to emphasize the importance of understanding our student demographics. With respect to history and context, I recall Dr. Rosa mentioning plans to gather updated figures on internet availability among our students. I second Kate's request \u2013 could we receive those statistics now? It's essential we base our decisions on the latest data, ensuring our initiatives address the actual needs of our students. Once armed with these numbers, we can engage in more targeted discussions, weighing potential partnerships and resource allocation strategies effectively. Let's ensure we're, uh, working toward concrete, measurable progress for our students."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Umm, sorry, David, if I might jump in quickly before you move on. Since we started discussing equity, specifically internet access disparities, we never got an official update, correct? Those new numbers were supposed to guide subsequent decision-making."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Well, I, uh, certainly appreciate your persistence, Kate, and, I mean, I concur \u2013 we did request those updated figures. I distinctly recall Dr. Rosa committing to furnishing them. Perhaps, uh, we could, uh, kindly request she shares those statistics now? Data-driven decision-making is vital, particularly when addressing issues as critical as internet accessibility. By examining the latest numbers, we'll better grasp our students' realities, thus crafting more effective solutions. Inclusivity and fairness dictate we prioritize our most vulnerable populations, after all. Could we, uh, confirm whether those numbers are indeed available tonight?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Now I'd also say, Jonno Alcaro speaking, thanks for that clarification, David. So yeah, let's focus then on Kate's original question about the statistics. Can we get those right now, Dr. McLaughlin? Then maybe down the line, we'll have a workshop focused on exploring ISP possibilities, Kate? That sounds reasonable to me."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Oh, absolutely, Kate, I completely agree. We do need to, uh, revisit those numbers. I mean, data drives our decision-making, and without an accurate understanding of the landscape, we risk, well, misallocating resources. Dr. McLaughlin, would it be possible to, uh, share those updated statistics now? I think it's crucial we ground our discussion in the most recent information. And, David, I appreciate your emphasis on demographic considerations. It's vital we keep our students' unique experiences top of mind as we, you know, navigate these complex issues..."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "If we don't have those figures tonight, perhaps we should table this for another meeting when we have all necessary information, as David said, to drive our decision-making process correctly. But, Judy, I'm glad you picked up on my concern earlier, acknowledging device distribution isn't everything. We must connect dots between the various components, especially when families cannot afford, uh, basic connectivity services. I believe David touched upon that too - what exactly is the scope of the problem, you know, on our end, locally. So, Dr. McLaughlin, do you anticipate having these updated numbers within, say, two weeks? Could we reconvene then with clearer direction and data to support our choices going forward?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Okay, hold up, folks, let's not get ahead of ourselves here. I totally understand why we're all interested in seeing those updated numbers, but, um, we can't assume they're gonna magically appear tonight, right? I mean, Dr. McLaughlin, can you tell us, uh, realistically, when we can expect to see those figures? Like Kate was saying, maybe we should table this discussion until we have all the facts, you know, to inform our decisions. I'm all about data-driven decision-making, and without that, we're kinda flying blind. So, let's, uh, take a step back, regroup, and come back stronger with some solid numbers behind us. Does that sound reasonable to"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "If I may chime in here, Ellen, I think you bring up a valid point. You know, rather than speculating or making assumptions, I suppose it's best to await those updated figures from Dr. McLaughlin. Realistically, we should get a firmer timeline on when we might receive them, so we're not just left wondering. Uh, and while we wait, perhaps we could explore the bigger picture. What other systemic barriers exist outside technology itself? Housing stability, food insecurity\u2014these factors intertwine and exacerbate the digital divide. How do we work collaboratively to provide wraparound support, recognizing each family's nuanced struggles? This broader perspective will help frame our decision-making once we finally have those statistics. Committed"
