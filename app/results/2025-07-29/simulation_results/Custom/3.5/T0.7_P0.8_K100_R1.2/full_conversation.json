    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.5: Curriculum Update - The board will consider adoption of a new mathematics curriculum for grades 6\u20138, aligned with updated state standards. The proposed curriculum includes digital resources, project-based learning activities, and teacher training components. Adoption is intended to improve student outcomes in algebra readiness and standardized test performance.. Who would like to start?"

    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I'll go ahead. Thank you, Chair Paige. Uh, just looking at the materials provided... So we have an opportunity here, really, to address some significant disparities in math achievement among our students, particularly those historically underrepresented groups. And it seems that this new curriculum does offer more comprehensive support structures. But before we move forward, could staff provide additional information about how they plan to ensure teacher buy-in and ongoing coaching around these changes? Because from what I understand, implementation can be quite complex when introducing something so different. I'd also appreciate examples of successful pilots elsewhere using similar approaches, especially where there were measurable improvements in both academic outcomes and closing gaps."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Yeah, thank you very much, Ms. Acuff. Dr. Haas, uh, maybe you could give us a little bit of info on exactly how we're gonna roll out this thing because that was one of my concerns too, umm, making sure teachers get all the help they need cause this isn't going to work unless they totally buy into this. Can you tell me what kind of professional development opportunities are planned? Are we talking summer workshops, are we doing follow-up sessions during the year? What type of backup are we providing them once we kick off next fall?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Okay, yeah, thanks, Kate. That's a great point about, uh, ensuring teacher buy-in. I think we've seen, you know, time and again, initiatives that look fantastic on paper, but then don't necessarily translate to, you know, actual classroom practice. So, Dr. Haas, I'm curious, beyond the initial rollout, are we planning any sort of, like, check-ins throughout the year to make sure teachers aren't hitting roadblocks or feeling overwhelmed by the new material? Maybe even having some peer-to-peer mentoring or coaches available to support them along the way? We want to set our teachers up for success here, right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thanks for bringing that up, Ellen. It definitely feels important to build in, uh, checks for understanding along the way, rather than assuming everything goes according to plan without hiccups. My question, actually, ties into that, which is \u2013 I noticed there wasn't explicit language addressing English learner supports within the presentation. Am I missing that somewhere? How do we guarantee that EL learners receive targeted assistance alongside their peers since research shows that personalized scaffolding makes such a difference for those kids? Could someone walk me through whether or not we considered hiring dedicated bilingual instructional specialists or potentially creating separate tracks tailored specifically towards supporting diverse linguistic needs? Just trying to tease apart those details now while we still can."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Absolutely, Katrina! I was thinking the same thing, you know, scrolling through the proposal, wondering, \"Where's the specific focus on our English learners?\" Um, Dr. Haas, can you, uh, enlighten us on that piece? Did we miss something, or did it just not make it into the written report? Because, I mean, we know how crucial it is to provide those extra layers of support for our EL students. Were there discussions around, say, adding bilingual instructors or, you know, specialized coaches to help bridge that gap? Or perhaps we're relying on existing staff to take on that responsibility? Just wanna make sure we're covering all our bases here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "If I might jump in real quick, colleagues... Respectfully building upon what Kate mentioned earlier regarding piloting programs, has there been any consideration given to possibly establishing control groups, you see, within our district to gauge effectiveness over time? By isolating certain variables, wouldn't we better grasp precisely how impactful this revamped math curriculum truly is, particularly vis-a-vis its effect on narrowing the achievement gap? In terms of resource allocation down the line, knowing the data-driven results would allow us to refine future investments strategically. Now, I fully acknowledge the appeal of rolling out system-wide simultaneously, but balancing idealism with pragmatism here, I believe taking a measured approach initially might yield invaluable insights long-term. Thoughts on that direction, please?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Okay, okay, good stuff being discussed here. Umm, I got two things jumping out at me after listening to y'all. One is \u2013 I love David's idea about setting up some control groups, and I hope that's something we seriously explore further. Cause, you know, proof is always in the pudding, right? Get that data backing up claims. Second thought though, I keep coming back to \u2013 how big of a lift is this going to be logistically speaking? Like, we talk about teacher buy-in, support systems, but practically speaking, what's involved in implementing this across every single grade level? Is it feasible in a short amount of time, considering staffing constraints plus budgetary considerations we haven't touched yet? Someone"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Ah, wow, lots of excellent points being raised here. Before we dive deeper, I just wanted to, uh, emphasize the importance of keeping our most vulnerable populations front and center as we discuss this new math curriculum. You know, guided by equity and social justice principles, I believe we must prioritize intentional supports for our English learners, students with disabilities, and those experiencing poverty. \n\nNow, Dr. Haas, I appreciate the emphasis on project-based learning and digital resources, but I'm concerned about potential inequities in access to technology outside the classroom. Have we explored ways to mitigate that issue, perhaps partnering with local organizations to provide devices or internet access for families in need?\n\nAlso, echoing Kate's sentiments, I'm interested in hearing"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Yeah, Judy, I couldn't agree more, prioritizing those vulnerable populations. On the tech accessibility concern, I remember reading about districts successfully partnering with libraries, offering free Wi-Fi hotspots or device rentals. Perhaps exploring options like that would help alleviate some burden. Also, related to your comment about emphasizing equity, I wonder if we should incorporate more concrete metrics measuring progress toward reducing the achievement gap. Not simply tracking overall scores but drilling down into subgroup performances. This gets back to needing clear targets for accountability purposes, ensuring we stay committed to transparency and collaboration. Does that resonate with others?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Oh, wow, so many great points flying around this room right now. I'm loving the emphasis on equity, Judy, absolutely critical. And, Kate, you brought up those library partnerships, that's genius. I mean, why reinvent the wheel, right? Borrowing from successful models saves us time and energy.\n\nRegarding metrics, I completely agree, Kate. We gotta track that progress, hold ourselves accountable. I recall a superintendent from another district sharing their strategy on disaggregating data, and it made a huge impact. We should definitely explore that route. Transparency breeds trust, you know?\n\nDavid, your suggestion about control groups resonates deeply. Pragmatic approach, perfect. I'd hate to rush into this without a clear picture"

    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Yeah, Judy, I couldn't agree more - equity and social justice have to guide these decisions. I understand where Jon is coming from on feasibility, logistics-wise, but let's balance that against our commitment to fairness and inclusion. Regarding those vulnerable populations, I think we need to ensure, you know, dedicated resources and support structures are built in. Control groups will indeed offer valuable insight, but we shouldn't forget the bigger picture: serving each student effectively. Uh, Dr. Haas, could you elaborate on how you envision incorporating, say, wraparound services or targeted interventions for English learners, special ed students, and low-income households? How does that fit into the proposed implementation timeline?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Okay, umm, sorry about cutting in there, folks. But before we move forward, can we get some clarity on \u2013 I guess my main worry is we're getting ahead of ourselves somewhat, talking about pilot studies and control groups when we haven't really hashed out the nuts-and-bolts of how this whole thing works logistically. Like, I hear Kate saying we need these support systems, and Judy stressing equity concerns. Those are both super valid. However, operationally speaking, I'm worried we glossed over key parts. Are we prepared to handle training teachers en masse? What kind of infrastructure changes need to happen in order to facilitate this shift? I know Dr. Haas had an answer ready for Ellen on peer coaching,"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Yeah, I totally agree, David, we don't want to lose sight of the larger goal here - serving each student effectively. And, uh, I appreciate your emphasis on dedicated resources and support structures. That brings me back to, you know, the importance of professional development opportunities for our teachers. As we roll out this new curriculum, they'll need guidance on, say, culturally responsive teaching practices, differentiated instruction, and trauma-informed care. Can we discuss possible partnerships with local universities or educational institutions to provide ongoing training and coaching? Maybe even establish mentorship programs pairing veteran educators with newer teachers? I'm thinking about sustainability here, making sure we set them up for success in the long run."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "So, Judy, you bring up an incredibly salient point regarding teacher preparation and capacity-building. With respect to history and context, we've seen initiatives falter due to inadequate support mechanisms. Balancing idealism with pragmatism, I propose we allocate sufficient funds for comprehensive professional development, embracing your suggestions about university partnerships and mentorships. Our educators require sustained guidance to navigate these shifts effectively, especially when catering to vulnerable demographics. Let's commit to fairness and inclusion by empowering our teachers to succeed in this endeavor. I seek clarification, Dr. Haas: were there plans outlined for teacher training beyond initial rollout phases? Are we looking at multi-year commitments to sustain momentum and foster meaningful change?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Right, so, Judy, I think your mention of professional development opportunities hits home. When discussing infrastructure changes, I assume we also consider, uh, necessary updates to our facilities themselves? Making sure classrooms accommodate diverse learning styles and abilities, maybe incorporating flexible seating arrangements, accessible technology, all that jazz. To piggyback off your partnership ideas, Judy, perhaps we collaborate with nearby schools facing similar challenges, exchanging best practices on facility design. Then again, it raises questions about costs associated with revamping our physical spaces. Anyone looked into estimates or grants available for modernization efforts tied directly to improving academic outcomes?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Absolutely, Judy, I'm with you on that. Professional development is crucial, and I love the idea of partnering with local universities... uh, you know, for sustained support. And, David, your point about allocating sufficient funds is spot on. We cannot afford to skimp on teacher prep, not if we wanna see real results. Now, Dr. Haas, I did have a follow-up question on the infrastructure side. Kate mentioned updating facilities, and I'm curious \u2013 have we factored in, uh, adaptive technologies for students with disabilities? Ensuring equal access, you know, in terms of assistive tools and accommodations? That's gotta be part of our planning process, right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thank you for the detailed response, Dr. Haas. One last aspect I wish to touch upon deals with evaluation criteria moving forward. How exactly will we measure success across different subgroups during these pilots? Shouldn't we develop clearer benchmarks aligned with our goals of closing the achievement gaps? In particular, I am drawn to Kate's earlier proposal for breaking down performance data further into specific demographic categories. A little bit of structure upfront ensures that later conversations remain grounded in hard facts. Does anyone else share those reservations?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Absolutely, Judy, guided by data and equity considerations. I believe focusing on subgroup performance aligns well with our broader objectives, particularly closing the achievement gap. By regularly monitoring these metrics, we create greater accountability internally and externally, fostering a culture of continuous improvement."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Well said, Kate, emphasizing the significance of tracking subgroup performance closely. I resonate with your sentiments, Judy, regarding professional development opportunities. Given our past experiences, we must prioritize sustainable support structures. On that note, Dr. Haas, would it be feasible to integrate, say, peer observation protocols, allowing instructors to learn from one another and refine their craft? Perhaps, too, we might invite guest speakers or host workshops focused on topics like cultural responsiveness, restorative justice, and implicit bias awareness. This would help solidify our commitment to inclusive pedagogies."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Did someone just mention infrastructure upgrades? Because that gets us into cost projections and whatnot."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Yeah, I completely concur, David, on prioritizing teacher empowerment through robust professional development. It's essential we acknowledge the complexities involved in implementing this new curriculum, ensuring our educators receive comprehensive training and coaching. I'd love to explore ways to incorporate peer mentoring, Kate, possibly establishing cohorts of teachers working together to address specific challenges. Additionally, Dr. Haas, could you elaborate on potential collaborations with local organizations specializing in diversity, equity, and inclusion? Their expertise might prove invaluable in helping us tailor our approach to meet the unique needs of our most vulnerable student populations. Ultimately, balancing feasibility with our unwavering commitment to equity demands careful consideration of every element involved in this initiative."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "So, Jonno, I understand where you're coming from re: infrastructure upgrades being costly. Yet, in pursuit of true systemic transformation, shouldn't we factor in, uh, medium- to long-term investments which ultimately benefit our students' educational journeys? Not simply slapping Band-Aids onto existing issues. While immediate expenses seem daunting, I believe thoughtful allocation now sets us up better for future successes. Uh-hmm, does that make sense?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Okay, umm, thanks, Kate.  You raise some excellent points there. I guess my concern still revolves around, uh, how much bang for buck we get out of upgrading everything simultaneously.  If I had my way, I'd focus more intently on, you know, providing quality educator training before worrying about classroom layout per se. But I hear you loud and clear on the value proposition behind investing upfront. Guess I'm seeking reassurance on whether, over time, such expenditures yield significant dividends academically speaking. Anybody got numbers supporting that notion?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Um, yeah, Jonno, I totally get why you're concerned about, uh, ROI on infrastructure upgrades. Believe me, no one wants to throw money at problems without seeing tangible results. However, I keep thinking about, you know, the whole \"build it and they will come\" mentality. If we invest in creating inclusive, adaptable environments, won't that actually enhance the impact of our teacher training initiatives? Like, imagine having dedicated spaces for project-based learning or sensory-friendly areas for kids with special needs. Wouldn't that amplify the effectiveness of our educators' newfound skills? I'm not saying it's gonna solve everything overnight, but I do think it's worth considering the compounding benefits here. Has anybody explored case studies or research on"
