    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.5: Curriculum Update - The board will consider adoption of a new mathematics curriculum for grades 6\u20138, aligned with updated state standards. The proposed curriculum includes digital resources, project-based learning activities, and teacher training components. Adoption is intended to improve student outcomes in algebra readiness and standardized test performance.. Who would like to start?"

    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I think that the addition of digital resources and project-based learning, I'm really excited about those pieces. And then, uh, could we get some clarification on what exactly we're looking at in terms of professional development opportunities for our teachers? What does that entail? How many hours of support are we providing them to ensure they can effectively integrate these new materials? Because we all know how important it is, um, guided by data and equity, that our teachers have the tools they need to reach every single one of our students. And I'd love more insight into how that piece fits together. Thank you."

    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Yeah, kateacuff, I totally agree with you on the importance of, you know, supporting our teachers in implementing this new curriculum. I mean, we've seen time and again that when our educators feel confident and prepared, our students benefit directly. So, uh, I'd also like to hear more about the specifics of the professional development plan. Are there gonna be, like, dedicated coaching sessions for teachers, or maybe even peer-to-peer mentoring opportunities? And what kind of timeline are we looking at for rolling out this training? Is it gonna happen over the summer, or are we talking about, you know, ongoing support throughout the year? Just wanna make sure we're giving our teachers everything they need to succeed."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Right. Absolutely, elenosborne. I was thinking along similar lines. We should absolutely explore the possibility of dedicating some time during the summer institute for our teachers to work closely with the coaches, uh, really diving deep into the new curriculum. That way, they'll feel more comfortable implementing it come fall. But, I mean, we shouldn't stop there. Ongoing support is crucial. Perhaps we could look into setting up regular check-ins throughout the year, where our instructional coaches provide targeted feedback, guidance, and encouragement to help our teachers stay on track. Guided by data and equity, I believe that's key to ensuring this rollout is successful and benefits each and every student equally."

    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Okay, so thank you both for bringing up professional development because that was definitely something I had a question about too. One thing that might be helpful for me to better understand -- since we did just go through budget season fairly recently, I guess my question would be, have we allocated specific funds within the budget for this professional development component? I don't see anything outlined here. If someone has access to that information real quick, please share. Otherwise, it seems super important for us to prioritize funding for things like training, mentorship, coaching support, especially if we want our staff to take full advantage of the new math curriculum. In which case, knowing specifically how much money we're committing towards that will inform future conversations around potential adjustments in the budget"

    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thanks, katrinacallsen, that's a great point. Funding, of course, plays a critical role in making this whole thing work. And, you know, I completely agree with, uh, everybody here. Professional development is essential for our teachers' success, which ultimately translates to improved student outcomes. Now, regarding the budget allocation, I believe our district administrator mentioned earlier that, yes, indeed, we have set aside specific funds for this very purpose. Could someone perhaps, uh, confirm that and give us an idea of the amount? It's vital we get a clear picture of our financial commitment to supporting our teachers. Additionally, I'd like to build upon kateacuff's suggestion about the summer institute. Maybe we could"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I appreciate davidoberg echoing the importance of funding. To follow up on katrinacallsen's question, I think we really need that number to move forward. I mean, uh, understanding the exact figure committed to professional development is crucial in helping our teachers succeed. Can someone clarify whether that amount is part of the current budget or if we're planning on revisiting the budget to accommodate these costs? Guided by data and equity, we must ensure we're allocating sufficient resources to drive meaningful change. So, yeah, I'd greatly appreciate that information."

  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Right. Uh, so, Kate Cuff, Ellen Osborne, Katrina Callisen, David Oberg \u2013 really good questions on the professional development front. Uh, let's clarify a little bit before moving forward. I got two questions myself. First, on the digital resources side of things \u2013 Kate touched on it \u2013 could you elaborate more on what kind of platform we're looking at? Will we have, say, multimedia tools, interactive lessons, simulations... that type of thing? Second, on this professional development piece, assuming we dedicate funds, would it be reasonable to anticipate incorporating peer review or collaborative planning processes among our teachers themselves to ensure consistency across schools and grade levels?"

    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Um, thanks, jonnoalcaro, for summarizing some of the key concerns around professional development. You know, I think we're all on the same page here - we recognize its importance in driving teacher confidence and, ultimately, student success. So, uh, building on kateacuff's and elenosborne's comments, I'd like to emphasize the need for ongoing support beyond the initial training period. Guided by equity and social justice, we must acknowledge that our teachers face varying levels of comfort with technology integration, project-based learning, and culturally responsive teaching practices.\n\nNow, I understand we've discussed the importance of dedicating funds for professional development, but I'd like to propose we also explore alternative models, such as peer"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Well, judy, that makes sense. So, uh, yeah, considering peer review mechanisms, that sounds incredibly valuable in encouraging consistent implementation across different schools. On top of that, I mean, ongoing support via instructional coaches and peer mentors would allow teachers to develop their skills further while sharing best practices. So, you know, guided by data and equity, we really want to create an environment that fosters continuous growth and mutual support among our educators. Does anyone have ideas on possible evaluation metrics for measuring the effectiveness of this teacher support system?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Ah, Judy, I love where you're going with that, exploring alternative models for professional development. Peer review, peer mentoring, that kind of stuff... it's all about creating a culture of collaboration and support among our teachers. And, you know, I think kateacuff hit the nail on the head with her emphasis on evaluation metrics. We gotta measure the impact of this support system, right? So, uh, maybe we could, like, establish some sort of teacher survey or focus groups to gauge their perceptions of the program's effectiveness? Or, I don't know, maybe even look at student outcome data to see if we're actually seeing improvements in algebra readiness and standardized test scores. Just throwing out some ideas, but I think"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I guess I was wondering if someone had any clarity on what exactly the total budget allocation is for those professional development initiatives. We talked about, you know, the value of teacher preparation, getting them trained and feeling supported."

You know, guided by data and equity, it's essential we create an environment that fosters continuous growth and mutual support among our educators. And, you know, Kate, your suggestion about establishing evaluation metrics resonates with me as well. Now, I'm curious, can we discuss ways to, uh, potentially tie those metrics to student outcomes, maybe even look at long-term impacts on student achievement and college-readiness rates?\n\nAnd, if I may, Katrina, I'd also like to reiterate the significance of having a clear picture of our financial commitment to supporting our teachers. Understanding"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Yeah, I think Judy made a fantastic point. I am curious, uh, Judy, when you talk about peer review and peer mentoring, would we potentially, you know, pair veteran math teachers with newer hires, uh, so they can learn from one another? Also, Ellen, your suggestion about focusing on student outcomes really resonated with me. Have we considered tying, say, teacher evaluations to student performance over time? Maybe incentivize collaborative planning between educators who show marked improvement in their students' results? Anybody have insights on either of those fronts?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Ah, wonderful discussion, colleagues! I totally resonate with Kate Cuff's concern about ensuring ongoing support for our teachers. You know, guided by equity and social justice, it's essential we provide the necessary scaffolding for them to thrive in this new math curriculum rollout. I mean, balancing introspection with action, we must commit to providing resources that cater to varying levels of teacher expertise, comfort with technology integration, and familiarity with culturally responsive pedagogy.\n\nRegarding peer review and mentoring, I think that's an excellent direction to explore. Jonno Alcaro, your suggestion about pairing veteran math teachers with newer hires has merit. Perhaps we could pilot a program where experienced educators serve as instructional coaches, offering targeted guidance and feedback to their peers."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Right, right. So, Judy, I just wanted to piggyback off of your thought there. If we go down the road of setting up this mentorship model, I wonder, how would we plan on rolling it out? Are we talking about, uh, school-wide trainings initially, followed by smaller group sessions, or possibly individualized coaching?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Absolutely, Jonno, I think that's a great question. Um, you know, when it comes to implementing this mentorship model, I envision us taking a multi-pronged approach. Initially, perhaps we could offer school-wide professional development opportunities, you know, to introduce the concept of peer mentoring and coaching, and then gradually transition into smaller group sessions focused on specific topics, like differentiated instruction or cultural responsiveness. From there, we might consider offering one-on-one coaching for teachers who require more targeted support. \n\nGuided by equity and social justice, it's crucial we prioritize flexibility and adaptability in our design, acknowledging that each school community has unique needs and strengths. By doing so, we'll be better equipped to foster a culture of"

  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Well, Judy, I think that's a great vision.  You know, uh, as we roll this out, I believe it would be useful to get, you know, input from both our teachers and administrators to make sure that we're hitting all bases effectively. I mean, guiding principles for me include staying adaptable, being open to change, and continuously assessing our progress. You know, I agree with Kate Cuff's sentiment that the devil lies in the details, so how will we guarantee that these peer-review sessions stay focused and productive? What's the general consensus on potential guidelines or protocols surrounding them? And Judy, I'd love your take on whether we should designate specific times for these reviews, given teacher availability, scheduling constraints, and"

  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Well, Judy, I definitely concur with your multi-faceted approach to implementing the peer-mentoring model. It seems you've thoughtfully considered our diverse school communities. In terms of ensuring those peer-review sessions remain focused and productive, perhaps we could establish clear expectations upfront regarding communication channels, feedback formats, and goals for the mentorship. With respect to logistics, we may need to work closely with our administrators to ensure adequate scheduling accommodations for our educators. Uh, what are others' thoughts on structuring these sessions? Should we allocate set blocks of time for them within the existing faculty meeting framework? And, David Oberg, I agree it's crucial we keep track of the fiscal investment for teacher development. Can we request that information from"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "You know, Jonno, I absolutely appreciate the emphasis on seeking input from our teachers and administrators throughout this process. That's, uh, critical. As Judy mentioned earlier, a multi-pronged approach will indeed help us tailor our support systems to meet diverse school needs. I think it's essential we maintain open lines of communication and regularly assess our progress. Guided by our core values - fairness, equity, education, and social justice - we need to strike that delicate balance between idealism and pragmatism. You know, I completely agree with Kate that establishing clear expectations and guidelines around peer-review sessions is key. Perhaps, you know, we could involve our educators in crafting those guidelines themselves. After all, who better understands their needs than"

    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Oh, wow, I love where we're heading here, folks! The whole idea of establishing clear expectations and guidelines for these peer-review sessions, that's, like, music to my ears. You know, Kate, I think involving our educators in crafting those guidelines is a fabulous idea. They're the ones on the frontlines, after all. And, Judy, your multi-pronged approach, I mean, it's just so thoughtful and comprehensive. I especially appreciate the emphasis on flexibility and adaptability. You know, as we move forward, I think it's gonna be super important to keep checking in with our teachers, making sure we're addressing their concerns and needs. Um, David, didn't you mention something about tying evaluation metrics"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Absolutely, Ellen. Tying evaluation metrics to student outcomes makes perfect sense, particularly when we factor in long-term effects on academic success and college readiness. It's essential, I think, we create a system where educators receive credit for their dedication to fostering student growth. I understand Kate Cuff's reservation about complexity, though. We don't want our focus on metrics to overshadow the importance of interpersonal connections and relationship-building between our educators. Perhaps, you know, we can investigate various assessment methods and find that sweet spot where we strike a balance between accountability and empathy."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Yeah, you know, I appreciate David's comment on metrics tied to student outcomes. And I agree, we shouldn't lose sight of relationships and emotional intelligence in our pursuit of measurable gains. But, Judy, I was wondering if we could delve deeper into how you envision, uh, sustaining teacher buy-in and engagement in this mentorship model. How will we, you know, nurture trust and foster openness within these peer-review sessions?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "So I guess what I'm trying to get at, Judy, is, while this sounds like a very appealing structure, and, you know, we value our collaboration among teachers and having, um, opportunities for peer-to-peer learning and sharing best practices, I still worry about, you know, consistency across schools. Like, in some places where maybe peer-review models haven't worked well historically, it might, uh, it might struggle to gain traction unless we provide additional supports. Would we have plans in place to address these inconsistencies, to sort of bring everybody along in this new approach?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Okay, okay, fantastic discussion. You know, Katrina, your point about consistency across schools really resonates with me. Balancing idealism with pragmatism, we can't assume every school community will automatically buy into this mentorship model. With respect to history and context, we've got to acknowledge past challenges with peer-review structures. Maybe we could, uh, earmark dedicated resources for schools that require extra support, allowing them to develop capacity for successful implementation. This way, we're committed to fairness and inclusion, ensuring equal access to quality educational experiences for all students. Now, Judy, building upon your initial proposal, could you walk us through your thinking on how we'd sustain teacher buy-in over time? What strategies did you have in"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Thanks for your insights, Dave. While considering sustainability, Judy, I do wonder if setting aside dedicated funds for training and supporting coaches in these peer-mentorship roles would further facilitate teacher buy-in. You know, we've had instances in which initiatives ultimately failed because we underinvested in their infrastructure. To prevent that, perhaps we could commit certain resources specifically for coach development and ongoing support, empowering them to become effective ambassadors for this program.  And, you know, Judy, another aspect that struck me is your mention of adaptability. For successful implementation, how would we account for inevitable variations in educator skill levels, experience, and even willingness to engage fully in this peer-review model? I mean, are we prepared to invest extra time in"
