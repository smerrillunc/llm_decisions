    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.4: Student Code of Conduct - The board will review proposed updates to the district\u2019s Student Code of Conduct, which outlines behavioral expectations and disciplinary procedures. Key changes include new rules around cell phone usage during instructional time, updates to the dress code to reflect inclusivity and professionalism, and revisions to disciplinary consequences to promote restorative practices.. Who would like to start?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I appreciate that overview, grahampaige. In reviewing these proposed updates to our Student Code of Conduct, one area where I'd love some clarification is how we're defining what constitutes appropriate use of technology during instructional time. We want students to be able to leverage digital tools effectively, yet minimize distractions. Can someone walk me through how we plan to support teachers with implementing those guidelines? And have we had opportunities for teacher feedback throughout this process?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Okay, thank you so much Kate Acuff for bringing up that really important question about supporting our teachers because, um, they truly need it when it comes to managing classroom dynamics and minimizing distractions while still using tech effectively. So Dr. McLaughlin could you maybe give us an update on, uh, whether there were opportunities for teacher input into the development of these updated policies and then also talk a little bit more about plans for professional development for them?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Yeah, I just wanna... build off what Kate was saying, you know, about supporting our teachers. Because, I mean, we all know how challenging it can be to manage classrooms nowadays, especially with technology being such a big part of everything. Um, so, Dr. McLaughlin, can you tell us, did we actually survey our teachers or get their feedback formally at some point during this process? Like, did we send out a questionnaire or hold focus groups or anything like that? Just wondering, you know, how we ensured their voices were heard in shaping these policy updates."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thank you both. One thing that stuck out to me after reading over these draft updates was how it mentioned incorporating restorative justice principles within discipline. Now, I'm curious, since this isn't something I've seen explicitly outlined before in student conduct codes here. Could we hear from staff how exactly we see these principles influencing specific discipline actions moving forward?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Respectfully building upon katrinacallsen's inquiry regarding restorative justice, I think it's crucial we delve deeper into understanding its practical applications within our schools. How does this shift impact training for administrators and educators alike? Are we planning workshops focused specifically on conflict resolution strategies rooted in empathy and mutual understanding? As we navigate this cultural change, ensuring consistency across campuses becomes vital. What measures are we taking to guarantee that every educator feels equipped and supported in adopting these novel approaches?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "That's fascinating stuff. You guys brought up fantastic points. Kate, Ellen, Katrina, David, each one resonated deeply. Supporting teachers is paramount, period. So I'll jump right onto that bandwagon too. Dr. McLaughlin, might you expand further on possible avenues for offering resources, maybe peer-to-peer learning sessions among instructors? It seems essential that we provide assistance navigating classroom management amid evolving tech landscape, as well as making sure they grasp this whole shift toward restorative justice methods. For instance, perhaps partnering local organizations specializing in conflict resolution? This way, educators gain valuable hands-on experience handling tough situations. Also, has consideration been given towards allocating dedicated prep periods strictly focusing on integrating fresh techniques learned during PDs? Thanks!"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Ah, thank you, grahampaige, for framing this discussion. I appreciate kateacuff's question about clarifying the parameters around technology usage during instructional time. As we strive for balance between leveraging digital tools and minimizing distractions, I believe it's crucial we prioritize equity in access to devices and internet connectivity outside the classroom. Have we considered ways to address potential disparities in students' ability to complete assignments requiring online engagement?\n\nAlso, I'd like to echo ellenosborne's concern about soliciting teacher input. Did we engage our educators through surveys, focus groups, or individual interviews to ensure their perspectives informed these policy updates? Their insights are invaluable in creating effective implementation strategies.\n\nMoving forward, I'm intrigued by katrinacallsen"

    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Well said, Judy Le, Jon Alcaro, Dave Oberg. When looking at the revised language surrounding cell phones and electronic device usage, I guess my follow-up is going to be similar to Kate's initial query. While I understand why certain restrictions make sense for instructional time, aren't there instances where mobile devices serve as assistive technologies, helping kids better comprehend material? Or even allowing others equal participation due to say physical limitations? If that's indeed the case, should we develop separate protocols addressing those unique scenarios, considering accommodations required under IDEA, Section 504, and Title II?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "So Dr. McLaughlin, thanks for responding earlier. Another thought came to mind related to restorative practices, echoing judyle's comment about prioritizing equity in terms of access to devices outside class. Would it help to integrate some kind of needs assessment upfront, recognizing students face different circumstances impacting their capacity to fully participate in these restorative circles or group discussions? Perhaps exploring ways to create safe spaces conducive to meaningful dialogue? Uh, sorry, to rephrase \u2013\u2013by acknowledging diverse backgrounds, socio-economic realities, English proficiency levels, et cetera, we could tailor supports accordingly. Does that resonate with the thinking behind these policy updates?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Yeah, I just wanted to piggyback off of judy le's point about equity in access to devices outside the classroom. You know, it got me thinking, um, we gotta consider how some families might struggle with providing those resources at home. Maybe we could explore partnerships with local organizations or libraries to offer, you know, free Wi-Fi hotspots or laptop rentals for those students who don't have reliable access otherwise? I mean, we want to level the playing field, right? Ensure every kid has an opportunity to succeed, regardless of their zip code or family income. Has anybody looked into possibilities along those lines, Dr. McLaughlin?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "So, Dr. McLaughlin, following up on comments made by Ms. Cuff, Mr. Alcaro, and Mr. Oberg, I think it's very clear we share concerns around teacher buy-in and proper support structures once we implement these changes. But another aspect caught my attention - you mentioned having conversations about technology integration with teachers, which led me to wonder if we've explored alternative formats for delivering professional development. Say, would we benefit from hosting peer-led workshops, possibly co-facilitated alongside educational specialists? Offering multiple modes of delivery, including asynchronous options, might increase flexibility for busy educators trying to fit PD into packed schedules."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Alright, respectfully adding onto Judy Le's excellent point about equity in device accessibility outside of the classroom setting, you know, balancing idealism with pragmatism, we must acknowledge resource constraints. Yet, seeking common ground, I firmly believe we can creatively bridge gaps. Partnering with local organizations or libraries, per Ellen Osborne's suggestion, sounds promising. And, uh, I agree with Kate Acuff's emphasis on identifying students facing challenges. To supplement these efforts, could we potentially allocate funds for targeted outreach initiatives targeting hard-to-reach populations, thereby fostering greater inclusivity? Additionally, committed to fairness and inclusion, we ought to investigate means of repurposing existing infrastructure to facilitate equitable distribution of resources. Lastly, with respect to history and context,"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Right, yeah, really good stuff tonight. Building off judy le's notion of providing more flexible pathways for professional growth opportunities, I am genuinely curious, Dr. McLaughlin, whether there exists scope for tapping local community colleges, universities, or ed-tech companies to collaborate on curriculum design or offer joint training programs for teachers. They often possess cutting-edge expertise we can leverage, particularly when implementing new policies centered on emerging trends like AI-powered adaptive assessments. By doing so, wouldn't we ultimately empower educators while also bridging knowledge divides between higher education institutions and K-12 environments? Any exploration down that road thus far?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "I think what's striking, listening to all of you... um, is this collective commitment to supporting our educators. We're talking about shifting paradigms, embracing restorative justice, and harnessing technology effectively. Now, guided by equity and social justice, I want to emphasize that we cannot overlook the significance of culturally responsive teaching practices within these updated policies. As we move forward, will we incorporate implicit bias training for faculty members, ensuring they're aware of potential blind spots affecting student outcomes? Moreover, could we establish mentorship programs pairing veteran educators with newer colleagues, promoting cross-cultural exchange and understanding?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Let me build on judy le's idea of incorporating culturally responsive teaching practices into these policy updates. In order to foster systemic improvement, shouldn't we explicitly require diversity, equity, and inclusion components within our professional development offerings moving forward? Perhaps inviting experts from local organizations or institutions specializing in culturally sensitive pedagogy? The goal being to equip educators with skills necessary for dismantling biases, cultivating empathetic classrooms, and celebrating our students' rich tapestry of experiences."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Um, building upon judy le's point regarding culturally responsive teaching practices... I completely agree, we need to, you know, walk the talk here. Implicit bias training for faculty, absolutely, and those mentorship programs sound great too. Can I ask, Dr. McLaughlin, have we considered, uh, weaving in some sort of accountability measures to ensure these trainings actually translate into tangible change in the classroom? Like, maybe regular check-ins or feedback mechanisms to gauge progress? Because, I mean, we wanna make sure we're not just checking boxes, right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thank you, Chairperson Paige. A few things caught my eye. On one hand, I find myself agreeing with jon alcaro's proposal for increased collaboration between community partners, especially involving local educational institutions. This feels ripe for innovation given tech advancements like AI-assisted learning platforms. At the same time, though, judy le brought forth valid concerns regarding resource allocation. Our district historically struggles to secure funding, which then trickles down to difficulties allocating resources equitably across schools. Are we prepared to discuss budgetary reallocations to accommodate these proposed changes?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Okay, thank you, Katrina Callsen.  Respecting judy le's call for cultural sensitivity, and, you know, emphasizing importance of adaptability within these policy revisions, I'd love us to revisit, with respect to history and context, how we currently address disciplinary actions tied to phone misuse.  Given the nuances involved, perhaps establishing clearer guidelines outlining educator discretion when handling infractions could aid consistency throughout districts.  That way, administrators confront fewer hurdles distinguishing between malicious intent versus genuine mistakes born out of unfamiliarity."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Thanks, Dave. One thing stuck with me from kate acuff's remark about creating safer discussion settings through needs assessments was her mentioning differing socio-economic realities. It seems vital we account for varying levels of digital literacy among both students and parents. Could we invest time during professional development sessions focusing specifically on strategies helping instructors differentiate instruction based on individual comfort levels with technology?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Well said, Jon Alcaro. With respect to history and context, we should indeed prioritize addressing disparities in digital literacy among students and parents alike. Differentiated instructional approaches tailored to individual comfort levels seem essential in today's landscape. What I'm wondering, Dr. McLaughlin, is whether we might dedicate dedicated time slots for parent-teacher conferences focused exclusively on discussing technology usage and available tools, further empowering them to better assist their children. Would such endeavors help bridge the gap?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Ah, I appreciate, um, the thoughtful suggestions shared so far. As we deliberate on these policy revisions, I keep coming back to the imperative of centering equity and social justice. Guided by these principles, I wholeheartedly endorse Kate Acuff's recommendation to integrate explicit DEI components within our professional development offerings. Furthermore, I concur with Ellen Osborne's concern about accountability measures \u2013 we must ensure these trainings yield meaningful shifts in practice.\n\nRegarding David Oberg's remarks on disciplinary actions related to phone misuse, I think revisiting guidelines on educator discretion is crucial. However, I'd caution against solely relying on punitive measures; instead, we should strive for a balanced approach combining empathy with consequences. \n\nNow, Jon Alcaro's"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "So, following up on Judy Le's astute observation regarding differentiated support systems, it strikes me that, guided by data and equity, we must delve deeper into the disparate effects of these discipline policies. How might we systemically tackle underlying issues contributing to behavioral problems rather than simply meting out punishments?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Yeah, Kate Acuff raises an excellent question. Uh, guiding ourselves with data and equity, it becomes clear that we must dig deeper, tackling root causes driving behavioral challenges rather than merely doling out punishment after punishment. I mean, isn't it high time we explored alternative supports addressing the unique needs of each student population?\n\nBalancing introspection with action, I propose we form an ad-hoc committee tasked with analyzing current discipline policies, pinpointing areas where systemic barriers hinder academic success, and recommending concrete solutions grounded in research-backed best practices. Through committed, inclusive, and data-driven dialogue, I believe we'll uncover innovative ways to redirect our focus toward proactive interventions and targeted assistance, thereby fostering healthier relationships between educators, students, and families."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Forgive me, Judy Le, I couldn't agree more. An ad-hoc committee delving into discipline policies would be instrumental in identifying and rectifying systemic roadblocks hindering academic achievement. To supplement your suggestion, could we explore integrating direct input from diverse stakeholders - teachers, counselors, family representatives, even students themselves - to guarantee authentic voices guide our recommendations? By doing so, we can ensure these revised policies genuinely uplift marginalized populations while bolstering overall campus well-being."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Absolutely, Kate Acuff, I think that's a fantastic addition. You know, ensuring stakeholder buy-in and ownership is critical to successful implementation. And I totally agree, we need to hear directly from, uh, teachers, counselors, family reps, and most importantly, students themselves. Their lived experiences will provide invaluable insights, allowing us to craft policies truly attuned to the needs of our most vulnerable populations. \n\nGuided by equity and social justice, I envision this ad-hoc committee engaging in committed, inclusive, and data-driven dialogue. We owe it to our students to create environments where they feel seen, heard, and valued. By balancing introspection with action, I firmly believe we can co-create policies that dismantle existing barriers, ultimately"
