    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.4: Student Code of Conduct - The board will review proposed updates to the district\u2019s Student Code of Conduct, which outlines behavioral expectations and disciplinary procedures. Key changes include new rules around cell phone usage during instructional time, updates to the dress code to reflect inclusivity and professionalism, and revisions to disciplinary consequences to promote restorative practices.. Who would like to start?"

  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I'll go ahead. So, um, reviewing the Student Code of Conduct. We have some significant changes here. I appreciate the work that went into these updates. Cell phone policy is an area where we've had some concerns from teachers and parents alike. I'm wondering if we can discuss how we're planning to implement these new rules, particularly with regards to enforcement, because we don't want it to be another thing our educators have to police all day long. How do we support them in this shift? And then there was one piece about restorative practices. Could someone walk me through what those revisions look like? Are they more guidance counselor-led, or peer-to-peer, or...how does that play out in practice?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Yeah, kateacuff, great point about supporting our educators. Um, implementation is key, right? I mean, we can't just put this policy out there without making sure our teachers have the tools they need to, you know, enforce it effectively. Maybe we could talk about, uh, providing some professional development opportunities for them, so they feel comfortable addressing cell phone use in the classroom. And maybe, I don't know, having some sort of, like, script or guidelines for them to follow when they do encounter issues.\n\nAnd regarding restorative practices, yeah, I'd love to hear more about that too. I think it's fantastic that we're moving towards a more, you know, holistic approach to discipline. Can someone"

    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I echo Ms. Cuff's gratitude for the work done on these updates. For the record, I also really appreciate the commitment to ensuring we have an inclusive environment reflected in our dress code policy. Two things jumped out at me in my review. First, since Ellen brought up supporting our teachers in enforcing these policies. Is there anything within the existing teacher training or PD programs that specifically addresses addressing student behavior and building positive relationships in classrooms? Or should we explore further dedicated sessions focused on strategies for managing cell phone usage and promoting positive behaviors? Then secondly, while flipping through the materials provided, I couldn't help but wonder whether the restorative justice language added, though appreciated, might benefit from accompanying descriptions explaining what exactly happens in practice when incidents arise"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Absolutely, katrinacallsen, I totally agree. Uh, so, regarding your first point, yeah, I think it's essential we make sure our teachers are equipped to handle these, you know, new expectations around cell phones and behavior. And, um, I believe we do have some, you know, implicit training built into our PD program, but maybe, I don't know, maybe it's not explicit enough? Should we consider adding specific modules or workshops on classroom management, conflict resolution, and relationship-building? That way, our educators feel confident addressing these issues.\n\nAnd, yeah, your second point, I completely get why you'd want more clarity on the restorative justice process. Like, what does it actually look like in"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thank you both. Just following up, Ms. O'Shea did address some of those concerns related to cell phone usage. But going along with some of the comments you made, Mr. O'Neal, the question becomes what does that framework for teacher feedback look like and how do we ensure consistency across schools. I didn't see that explicitly stated anywhere in the draft document. There's definitely value in having, I guess, clear examples of successful strategies or case studies on how these policies played out elsewhere, which might help inform teacher buy-in on our end."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Well, Kate, Ellen, Katrina, excellent observations and questions thus far. To pick up on something you mentioned earlier, Kate, and Ellen echoed later \u2013 implementing change isn't simply a matter of handing down edicts, but rather empowering our educators with resources and confidence to carry out these updated expectations successfully. It strikes me, respectfully, that we're all invested in creating better learning environments, and part of that involves giving teachers tools and trust to navigate these new boundaries.\n\nNow, on the topic of restorative practices, I wholeheartedly endorse shifting focus toward healing and repairing harm instead of solely meting out punishment. Still, I concur with Katrina, understanding precisely how we plan to execute that in different scenarios will require additional detail. Perhaps our"

  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Okay, jumping in, thank you all for those comments. This is clearly something close to all of us. With the revised Student Code of Conduct, you know, these changes have been needed for quite a while now. While considering, uh, I mean, it appears there's no disagreement about how important the shift away from punitive actions is in favor of the restorative practices model. As much as I welcome that change, I worry that we're still relying on pretty vague language in the proposal. Restorative justice means many things to different people. And, I mean, perhaps it's overly simplistic of me, but wouldn't it strengthen this entire policy if we offered clearer definitions or at least some concrete illustrations of what kind of situations they would apply"

    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "I think we're having a really rich discussion here. I appreciate, um, Kate bringing up the concern about enforcement and supporting our educators. And, you know, Ellen, your suggestion about providing professional development opportunities, I think that's crucial. Because, guided by equity and social justice, we want to make sure our teachers feel empowered to create an inclusive environment. \n\nRegarding restorative practices, I'm glad we're exploring this shift. Jon, your point about needing clearer definitions is well taken. I think, uh, we owe it to ourselves and our students to provide more specificity around what this looks like in practice. Maybe, I don't know, we could develop some scenarios or case studies to illustrate how restorative justice plays out in different"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thanks, Judy, and others for picking up on the importance of illustrating how these concepts come alive in practice. For restorative justice, maybe, uh, we could borrow examples from schools where they've seen success with that approach. One of the things that resonated with me, Judy, in terms of seeking greater clarity, would be including a few real-world anecdotes to show how staff and students worked together to resolve conflicts using restorative principles. Those types of narratives often resonate deeply with educators. What if we were to have some type of workshop series, allowing teachers to share best practices and experiences with implementing restorative justice, focusing on specific instances where they've faced challenges, found creative solutions, and ultimately saw improved outcomes? In terms of setting our"

    "speaker": "ellenosborne",

And, um, Judy, I totally agree, we need more specificity, I mean, around what this looks like in practice. Case studies, scenario-based training, that kinda stuff. And, you know, David, your comment about trusting our educators, giving them the autonomy to, you know, make decisions, that's huge. I think we can all agree on that. Now, uh, I'm curious, has anybody thought about, you know, involving students in this process, getting their input on how restorative practices can, you know, improve their experience? I mean"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I very much echo Kate's appreciation for the effort invested in updating this document. On the issue of cell phones, certainly, we want to avoid placing yet another burden upon our educators. Were there any considerations given during this process, Ms. O'Shea, to incorporating specific training components or even simple scripts to facilitate smoother interactions between teachers and students over device usage?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Now, I want to acknowledge the valuable suggestions made by several members concerning support mechanisms for educators. Clearly, we cannot expect them to implement new expectations surrounding cell phone usage and behavioral standards without sufficient backing. In light of history and context, I believe we must walk the line between setting clear boundaries and fostering an atmosphere conducive to learning. So, balancing idealism with pragmatism, perhaps we could explore offering teachers flexibility within certain parameters. We should ideally seek common ground among various stakeholders to devise effective ways to manage student conduct. Speaking of which, Judy and Kate, your ideas about illustrating restorative justice through actual cases and peer-to-peer knowledge-sharing sessions seem particularly compelling. Would we consider allocating resources to host such forums for educators to exchange insights and methods"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "And speaking of resources, Judy, Kate, and Dave, in developing these training models, especially with respect to restorative justice - are we prepared to budget accordingly for, say, instructor fees, course materials, possibly guest speakers? We have to consider whether, realistically, we'll be able to offer these sorts of professional development opportunities for our educators without putting undue strain on existing budgets. Could we explore partnering with local institutions of higher education, community organizations, or non-profits to co-fund some of these initiatives? They may possess the expertise, infrastructure, and funding sources we desperately need to roll out these ambitious plans effectively."

    "speaker": "judyle",

We want to empower them to make decisions, right? And, Judy, I mean, I was thinking, we could also involve students in this process, get their input on how restorative practices can, you know, improve their experience. I mean, they're the ones most impacted by these policies, after all. And, Ellen, your suggestion about case studies and scenario-based training, that makes total sense. We need to give our educators the tools they need to succeed. \n\nGuided by equity and social justice, I think we're moving"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Absolutely, we need to find ways to build bridges between administrators, teachers, and students when enforcing these new codes of conduct. It seems, Judy, Jon, you guys hit upon an essential aspect, ensuring educators receive adequate support, guidance, and resources throughout the implementation phase. Now, speaking of resourcing, Jon, budgetary realities shouldn't prevent us from making meaningful investments in our educators. Can we explore grant options, public-private partnerships, or potentially crowdfunding to offset expenses associated with instructor fees and training materials?\n\nkateacuff: Uh, to tie into what Ellen suggested regarding student involvement, would it be possible for us to establish a pilot program? Like, select a handful of classes or a single school to pioneer this new code of conduct?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Right, so, I think we're all on the same page, uh, recognizing that our educators need support, and, you know, Kate's idea about, uh, illustrative examples, that's fantastic. And, Judy, yeah, involving students, absolutely, they're the ones most affected by these policies, after all. Now, uh, regarding budget constraints, Jon, I understand your concerns, but, I mean, can't we, you know, prioritize this investment in our educators? I'd hate for financial limitations to hold us back from doing what's right for our kids. Uh, Kate, your suggestion about grants and partnerships, that sounds promising. Have we explored, you know, federal funding opportunities, too?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thanks, Judy, for echoing my sentiment on the value of real-world examples. I completely concur that providing our educators with practical applications will help solidify their grasp of restorative justice principles. Ellen, I appreciate your emphasis on prioritizing these efforts despite budgetary limitations. Exploring alternative funding streams - government, corporate, foundation, and community partnerships alike - holds promise. Has anyone considered tapping into potential partnerships with nearby universities? That might allow us access to subject-matter experts and additional resources while further enhancing our relationship with local educational institutions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Yeah, Kate, that's a great point about, uh, university partnerships. I mean, we could leverage those connections to, you know, tap into expert knowledge and resources. And, uh, Judy, I think your idea about, you know, scenario-based training, that's really important. We need to give our educators, you know, concrete examples to work with. Um, so, I'm wondering, Kate, have we considered, you know, establishing a working group to, uh, explore these partnership opportunities? Maybe, uh, David or Jon could, you know, take the lead on that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "You know, just wanted to toss one more thing out there, since, uh, restorative justice came up a lot today \u2013 we did mention previously exploring outside resources. Perhaps it's time to revisit that notion, looking at non-profit partners, foundations, you know, places that provide free or low-cost materials and instruction. Is that worth considering? Are we close to securing such collaborations, Jon, Judy, Ellen? We've heard varying degrees of optimism on the possibility of extramural assistance."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Now, I want to weigh in, building off what Judy mentioned regarding support systems for our educators. Certainly, we cannot reasonably expect them to navigate novel expectations for both cellular devices and behavioral norms without corresponding backup. As we strike a balance between idealism and pragmatism, I suggest affording our instructors latitude within predetermined guidelines. Ideally, we aim to forge consensus among stakeholders and arrive at functional strategies to regulate student behavior. While discussing approaches, Judy and Kate, your notions on leveraging authentic scenarios and peer-led information exchanges appear incredibly compelling. Shall we allocate resources to sponsor similar platforms where educators share experiences and glean insights from each other?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Oh, yeah, on that note, I mean, Judy brought up something key - our educators' workload. How, realistically, are they going to fit in additional responsibilities around cell phone monitoring alongside fresh behavioral standards? Were there any discussions about supporting them with simplified protocols, maybe scripts for handling device-related issues or straightforward classroom management techniques?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Yeah, Kate, I think your idea about, uh, piloting this new code of conduct in, say, a few classrooms or even one school, that's really smart. We need to, you know, test these waters before scaling up district-wide. And, Ellen, your point about prioritizing investments in our educators, I couldn't agree more. Guided by equity and social justice, we must recognize the critical role they play in shaping our students' experiences.\n\nNow, Jon, regarding budget concerns... I understand where you're coming from, but we can't let financial limitations hold us back from creating positive change. Kate's suggestion about grants, partnerships, and crowdfunding is definitely worth exploring. Have we looked into, um, private donors"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Well, thanks, Judy. Just picking up on the theme of educator empowerment and trust, how can we ensure, then, that they're equipped to handle, you know, challenging conversations around digital citizenship and responsible tech use? Would we provide, for instance, scripted responses to common misbehaviors or role-playing exercises for particularly thorny situations?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Yeah, I think, uh, that's a great question, Kate. So, we need to, you know, equip our educators with the skills and confidence to tackle those tough conversations. I mean, scripted responses and role-playing exercises sound like excellent ideas. We should, uh, consider having some sort of, you know, facilitator or coach to guide them through these types of situations. And, Judy, your point about simplifying protocols, that's huge. Our educators already have enough on their plates. We don't want to, you know, overwhelm them with extra responsibilities. So, uh, maybe we can develop some kind of, you know, flowchart or decision tree to help them navigate these device-related issues. What do you"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Okay, sorry, quick follow-up: I guess I'll loop back to Ellen, who talked about needing scripted responses, because I'm thinking back to our discussion earlier when we were considering whether or not, say, to create scenarios for, uh, discipline incidents. And I wonder if, like, developing guidelines around how we address those scenarios could also benefit from those scripted responses, so, Ellen, did you have anything specific in mind? Or was that, like, somewhat tangential?"
