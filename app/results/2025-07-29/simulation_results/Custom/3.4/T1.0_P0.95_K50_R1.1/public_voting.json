    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.4: Student Code of Conduct - The board will review proposed updates to the district\u2019s Student Code of Conduct, which outlines behavioral expectations and disciplinary procedures. Key changes include new rules around cell phone usage during instructional time, updates to the dress code to reflect inclusivity and professionalism, and revisions to disciplinary consequences to promote restorative practices.. Who would like to start?"

  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Okay, thanks, Graham. Uh, with regards to this new policy and especially that section, I'm looking at page five here, the revision about restorative practices uh, can someone walk me through how we're planning on ensuring those are equitable across schools and how we'll measure success, you know? I want to make sure our discipline policies aren't inadvertently creating more disparities in terms of, say, racial or socioeconomic groups. Guided by data and equity, right? I'd love some clarification on what metrics we're gonna use to assess these outcomes. Are there any key indicators we should be keeping an eye on? And also, have we had chances for students themselves to weigh in on these changes?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Kate, great question, you know, really getting at the heart of, um, what we're trying to achieve here. So, I think, yeah, ensuring equity across schools, that's... that's crucial. And, uh, I totally agree, we need to make sure we're guided by data, you know? I mean, we don't wanna, uh, inadvertently create more disparities. That's the last thing we want.\n\nSo, I believe, from my understanding, our admin team has, uh, been working closely with, uh, community partners, including some of the advocacy groups, to make sure we're addressing, you know, systemic issues. And, um, they've developed some key performance indicators, KPIs"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Ellen, thank you for uh, providing context and acknowledging the importance of equity. I appreciate that. And just to uh, drill down a bit further, maybe, I mean, could we get a sense of what those specific, uh, performance indicators would look like? Are we talking about, say, disparity rates in discipline or academic performance or maybe student surveys around sense of belonging and safety? And then, you know, beyond these indicators, what mechanisms do we have in place to ensure we're incorporating student voice, which I think was a huge piece missing in past revisions?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Yeah, absolutely, Kate, I understand where you're coming from. Um, so, from what I recall, the admin team was suggesting, uh, we track, you know, discipline referral rates by demographic group, as well as, um, suspension and expulsion rates, obviously. And, I mean, we wanna see, you know, a decrease in those disparities over time. We're also considering, uh, student surveys, yeah, exactly like you mentioned, around sense of belonging and safety, and maybe even, you know, teacher feedback forms to get a more comprehensive picture. And, um, regarding student voice, I believe we, uh, plan to establish a student advisory committee, comprised of, you know, diverse representatives from each"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "And I guess, yeah, just to build upon this, I mean it sounds promising. Student advisory committee makes total sense to ensure the voices are heard. But, and I know I keep going back to this, how do we guarantee that, say, the student advisory committee truly represents the diversity of the entire student body, not just kind of like the most vocal or engaged students? Because we're trying to hear from marginalized groups too. That's a big concern."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thank you, Ellen. Thanks for sharing all of those updates. Um, along with Kate's questions, I also wanted to kind of explore the whole element of restorative practices. Can anyone just give some detail around what kinds of training we'd provide teachers and staff to support implementation effectively?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "With respect to history and context, Ellen, I appreciate your update on the restorative practices, because I think we've struggled with this in the past, making sure our discipline policies align with our values. Kate raises a great point about equity and ensuring that these efforts, particularly the student advisory committee, truly represent our student body. I share her concerns, wanting to avoid inadvertently marginalizing certain groups further. On the restorative practices side, Katrina brings up a very valid point. What kind of training are we going to provide to staff and teachers to implement this effectively? We want to make sure they feel supported, equipped, and empowered to make a positive impact. I'd love to hear more about our plans for professional development. And, Ellen,"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Right, okay, so, uh, regarding the student advisory committee, Kate, I totally understand your concerns. We, you know, definitely want to ensure that it's representative of, uh, all our students, not just, you know, the ones who always speak up. I think, um, one way we can do that is by, you know, actively seeking out, uh, diverse representatives, you know, from different grades, backgrounds, and experiences. Maybe, um, we can even, you know, partner with some of our, uh, student organizations, like the, uh, Latinx club or the, you know, Black Student Union, to help us reach, uh, a broader range of students. And, I"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I do appreciate the direction on student advisory committee. Just to piggyback off Dave's question: What's the timeline for implementing this training for staff, and will it be, uh, separate trainings based on roles? Like, are we doing something specifically for administrators versus classroom teachers versus maybe counselors?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "With respect to history and context, um, I appreciate the direction on student advisory committee. Now, to build upon Kate's question, and, Ellen, if I might add, what I'd love to see, too, is, uh, some sort of evaluation mechanism, or checkpoint process, you know, built into the student advisory committee structure. This way, we can, uh, regularly check in and assess whether we're, indeed, reaching all our students, not just the loudest or most engaged. I mean, balancing idealism with pragmatism, we, uh, gotta make sure that, uh, our efforts don't, unintentionally, uh, silo ourselves. How does that sound, Ellen? Would something like that"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Yeah, absolutely, Kate and Dave, I mean, great points. So, uh, regarding the training timeline, I believe, um, we're looking at, you know, a phased rollout, probably starting with, uh, our administrators and, you know, school leaders, and then, you know, moving on to, um, classroom teachers and, eventually, you know, all staff members. And, yes, I think, uh, separate trainings based on roles would make sense, you know, to address specific needs and, um, responsibilities. We'll, uh, work with our HR department to develop, you know, tailored modules and, you know, make sure everyone feels, uh, comfortable and confident implementing restorative practices"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Ellen, thanks for walking us through this. I know there's a lot of passion and intentionality behind our goal of reducing suspensions. It's a tough nut to crack, right? And we need to make sure, you know, that whatever approaches we take aren't gonna inadvertently widen the gap between, you know, our highest- and lowest-performing students. Kate and Dave brought up, um, important points. To build on that, I'm wondering, Ellen, could you tell me, have we had conversations yet with our student organizations about the potential to incorporate more peer-to-peer mediations within, you know, our restorative practices?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Ah, Jon, great question, yeah... So, uh, we did, um, have an initial conversation with, you know, some of our student organization leaders, yeah, about the possibility of, uh, incorporating peer-to-peer mediations into our restorative practices. And, I mean, they were, you know, really receptive to the idea, which is, uh, fantastic. We're thinking, um, maybe we could, you know, pilot it with, uh, some of our upperclassmen, you know, trained mentors, and then, you know, gradually roll it out to, uh, other grades. But, I mean, we need to, uh, make sure we're, you know, supporting them properly"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Alright, thank you, Ellen, for walking us through the proposed measures. I appreciate the emphasis on, uh, tracking discipline referral rates by demographic group, as well as, you know, student surveys and teacher feedback. Guided by equity and social justice, I think it's essential we prioritize, uh, marginalized groups' voices within the student advisory committee. Now, I'm curious, Ellen, how do you envision, um, balancing, you know, representation with, uh, avoiding tokenization? Could we, perhaps, involve, uh, community organizations or local advocacy groups to, you know, support our efforts in identifying, uh, diverse representatives? Additionally, I'm intrigued by the idea of, uh, peer-to-peer mediations."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Yeah, Judy, great points, and I totally agree, you know, prioritizing marginalized groups' voices is, uh, crucial here. Balancing representation with, you know, avoiding tokenization is, I mean, a delicate task, but, uh, involving community organizations and local advocacy groups could, you know, really help us, um, get it right. We've had, you know, some success with partnerships like that in the past, and I think, uh, it's worth exploring again. Yeah, and peer-to-peer mediations, I mean, I think that's, uh, really promising too. If we can, you know, empower our students to, uh, take ownership of resolving conflicts, that's, you"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "So I appreciate, Ellen, where you're headed, and Dave, you make an excellent point around equity. And I think there's a bigger opportunity for professional development, particularly centered around implicit bias and culturally responsive teaching practices, especially when you consider, um, student demographics. What I'm trying to get at is, beyond restorative practices, how will we ensure teachers' capacity, you know, to confront and dismantle their own biases when engaging with students and leading discussions?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Yeah, Kate, I totally, uh, agree with you, and, you know, that's actually, um, something we've been, uh, discussing with our, you know, diversity and inclusion team. I mean, it's, uh, critical that we, you know, address those implicit biases, and, you know, culturally responsive teaching practices are, uh, key to, you know, creating an inclusive environment. So, um, in terms of professional development, I think, uh, we should, you know, definitely prioritize, uh, training sessions focused on, you know, implicit bias and cultural responsiveness. Maybe, um, we could, you know, invite some experts in to, uh, facilitate those conversations and,"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "With regard to that, you know, partnership piece, would we potentially, uh, engage, you know, outside consultants or, um, experts in those areas? And also, I'm wondering, given the, uh, phased implementation, you know, what's the plan for, uh, monitoring progress, collecting data, and, you know, evaluating the effectiveness of these new practices? Will we have, uh, clear indicators in place, and, you know, milestones to track? And what kind of, uh, accountability structures can we expect to ensure fidelity, you know, districtwide?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I truly value the recommendations presented, and I'm excited to build off what my colleagues mentioned earlier. Ellen, could we delve deeper into how the district plans to handle resource allocation when implementing these policies? I understand the importance of restorative practices, but ensuring accessibility goes hand-in-hand with, uh, resource availability. Would we be repurposing existing resources, seeking additional funds, or leveraging, you know, grants or partnerships to, uh, supplement?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Yeah, Kate, Katrina, excellent questions, both of you. Uh, so, regarding, you know, partnering with experts, I think that's, um, a great idea. We, uh, definitely want to bring in, you know, people who have expertise in, uh, implicit bias and culturally responsive teaching practices. And, I mean, we could, uh, use a combination of, you know, internal resources and external experts to, uh, provide that professional development.\n\nAnd, you know, monitoring progress and collecting data, I mean, that's, uh, crucial. We need to, uh, establish, you know, clear indicators and milestones to track. I was thinking, um, maybe we could, you"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Yeah, um, with respect to history and context, I'd just like to say, I'm, uh, glad we're having this discussion. The reality is, our current discipline policies haven't been, you know, serving our most vulnerable populations particularly well. Restorative practices offer, I mean, significant potential, but, as Kate pointed out, we must ensure we're addressing, you know, systemic issues. I totally agree with Ellen on the need for, uh, tailored training for different roles, and, I mean, it's crucial we monitor progress, collecting data, evaluating effectiveness. Can I suggest, uh, establishing a task force with, you know, reps from various stakeholders to, um, guide our implementation? That way,"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "And I think, you know, we shouldn't forget to examine how we're, uh, currently using detention halls either. Like, I mean, you mentioned suspension alternatives, Ellen. Are we maybe, uh, looking into alternative uses for those spaces during the day, you know, considering some sort of enrichment opportunities or one-on-one time with instructors? And while we're at it, Ellen, what's the status of the proposal from, uh, parent advocates regarding peer-led mental health sessions? I know we previously, uh, tabled it due to timing constraints, but I believe it could still provide valuable supplemental support for our kids, especially in light of these changes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Yeah, David, I love the idea of, uh, establishing a task force, you know, with reps from various stakeholders. That way, we can, um, ensure we're, you know, getting buy-in and input from, uh, all the right folks. And, Jon, good point about, you know, rethinking detention halls. I mean, it's, uh, crazy to think we're, you know, wasting this space, right? Alternative uses, like, uh, enrichment opportunities or one-on-one time with instructors, that's, uh, totally doable. And, oh, yeah, the peer-led mental health sessions, you know, I had almost forgotten about that proposal. Um, I think we should"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Okay, so, Ellen, I'm, you know, still thinking about, uh, representation on the student advisory committee. I totally agree, um, involving community organizations and local advocacy groups could, you know, really enhance our efforts. But, you know, I'm also worried about, uh, overburdening these organizations, right? Have we considered, um, providing, like, some form of compensation or support for their involvement? Maybe, uh, some kind of stipend or, I don't know, professional development opportunities? We want to, you know, ensure they're empowered to participate, rather than, uh, feeling like they're, you know, shouldering the entire load."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "You know, I really appreciate, David, the emphasis on task forces and stakeholder representation. It's essential we're, uh, fostering that collaboration and, you know, engaging diverse perspectives to, uh, drive real change. And, Jon, your point about, uh, detention hall usage offers exciting possibilities for, I mean, more productive uses of that time, like, uh, tutoring or enrichment activities. And, Ellen, you were saying about the peer-led mental health sessions, I remember we did table that proposal, and now, you know, seems like a perfect moment to revisit it."
