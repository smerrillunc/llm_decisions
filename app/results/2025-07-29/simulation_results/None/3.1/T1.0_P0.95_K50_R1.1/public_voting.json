    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.1: COVID Mask Policy - The board will discuss the district\u2019s COVID-19 health protocols, specifically whether students should be required to wear masks while in classrooms. This policy would apply during the regular school day, with exceptions for lunch and designated mask-break periods. The goal is to balance student safety with comfort and learning effectiveness.. Who would like to start?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I would like to go first, thank you, Chair. Kate Acuff here. As we all know, the COVID pandemic has forced us to continually adapt our approach to ensuring the health and well-being of our students and staff. At this point, given new information emerging from the CDC and state authorities about COVID transmission,  I would support requiring students to wear masks in classrooms throughout the school day. It may cause some discomfort, but if there were an outbreak at one of our schools, I wouldn't want any family to have to deal with the potential consequences. And let me clarify that we will need to specify how often these mask breaks are and their duration."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, Kate. Ellen Osborne speaking. While I understand your concerns, Kate, I'm not convinced that mandating masks all day is the right decision. We've had relatively low transmission rates in our district so far, and I worry that this could impact students' ability to focus and engage in class. Not to mention the potential negative effects on our younger students' social development and emotional well-being. Can we explore alternative measures, such as improved ventilation systems or increased cleaning protocols, rather than resorting to masks?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Ellen, I understand where you're coming from. But let's remember, this isn't just about transmission rates within our district. We also have students who commute to school on public transportation, participate in extracurricular activities, or have family members working outside the home. There are multiple avenues for exposure that aren't reflected in our internal transmission statistics. Improved ventilation and enhanced cleaning regimens certainly have value, but they can only do so much. To my mind, having students wear masks during instructional time provides an additional layer of protection without which we risk rolling back the progress we've made thus far."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "I understand your points, Kate, but I still have concerns about the potential drawbacks of mandatory masking. Have we considered surveying parents and teachers to get a better sense of their perspectives on this issue? Perhaps we could also consult with our own district's medical advisor to weigh in on the effectiveness of masks versus other mitigation strategies? I think it's essential to gather more input before making a decision that affects every student in our district."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "That makes perfect sense, Ellen. Actually, I agree we should seek the views of parents, educators, and medical experts. In fact, perhaps Dr. Patel, our district medical advisor, could brief us on her assessment of the current research regarding mask efficacy and other preventative measures. Would it be feasible, Madam Chair, to schedule a special meeting later this month with Dr. Patel and invite parent representatives to share their thoughts? That way, when we make our final decision, it'll be informed by a wide range of perspectives."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I'd also appreciate a special meeting because Dr. Patel was very clear with us last year when we set up our mitigation policies that she could adjust her advice based on changes in either county cases, hospitalization rates, vaccination levels, or new studies. So yeah, hearing what the current science says would be important before we change. Also, for any policy, how does that affect athletics, music, et cetera."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Dave Oberg speaking. I'm going to echo Katrina's concern. Athletics and certain programs have proven challenging during the pandemic, so yes, we need clarification on how this policy might impact them. If we adopt this policy, how would it work with extracurriculars? We should consider what adjustments we need to make now instead of addressing issues later down the line."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "When she talked to us about mitigations, it really was around contact tracing being critical.  Like, if you touch your face, you touch something someone else touched, and then you're going to spread it.  And masks help prevent touching your face but don't address that second part. Does it make sense when there is no contact tracing happening right now to still follow those guidelines from last winter when things were different, because we didn't have vaccines, we didn't have the same understanding of how it spreads or how we could protect ourselves. That is kind of what confuses me a bit."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "I'll go next.  Kate and Ellen both bring up valuable points. Jonno Alcaro speaking. I believe it would be wise to establish common ground by exploring alternatives as Ellen suggested earlier. I recommend consulting Dr. Patel, as we did previously. Her guidance on the scientific aspects of mask mandates would enable us to evaluate both sides of the argument before taking action. Additionally, gathering feedback from parents and teachers via surveys will give us greater insight into their feelings and worries."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Judy Le speaking. I apologize for joining the conversation late. I couldn't help but notice the discussion revolving around the feasibility of mandating masks during classroom instruction. As a board member, it's crucial we prioritize student well-being, but we must also ensure that our decisions align with local health guidelines. I concur with Kate that Dr. Patel's expertise would be invaluable in informing our decision. Has anyone reached out to Dr. Patel to gauge her availability for a special meeting, as Kate suggested earlier? And if so, what's her initial take on the matter? Additionally, I'd like to inquire about the logistics of implementing mask breaks \u2013 would we need to hire additional staff or rearrange existing schedules to accommodate these breaks effectively?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Yes, Madam Chair. I already reached out to Dr. Patel, and she expressed her availability to meet later this month. In terms of logistics, I suppose that might require collaboration between administration, teachers, and facilities management to identify suitable areas for these mask breaks. Ideally, that could happen during regular recesses, outdoor time, or lunch periods, but we would indeed need to discuss those details further. What we can do at this meeting is direct the superintendent to start thinking through those practicalities while we await Dr. Patel's expert input and feedback from stakeholders. Does that sound reasonable, Madam Chair?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "I'm glad we're considering seeking Dr. Patel's expertise and gathering more input from stakeholders. However, I want to emphasize that we shouldn't solely rely on Dr. Patel's opinion. While she's an expert in her field, we also need to account for the social-emotional impacts on our students. I'd like to propose that, in addition to Dr. Patel's briefing, we also invite a representative from our counseling department to share their insights on how mask mandates might affect students' mental health and well-being. This will provide us with a more comprehensive understanding of the issue."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thank you, Ellen. I completely agree that our counselor would have valuable insights on what a mask mandate might mean to students in terms of their stress level and emotions around wearing those."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Exactly, Katrina. It's crucial that we consider the whole child - not just their physical health but also their emotional well-being. By inviting our counselor to share their perspective, we can gain a better understanding of how a mask mandate might impact our students' overall quality of life. I think it's especially important given the challenges they've faced over the past couple of years."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "I would love to know the logistical implications of mask breaks.  That sounds good; recess, lunchtime, and those are some natural places where kids could take off their masks briefly. But I am concerned about extracurricular activities, such as sports practices, music rehearsals, and stuff like that.  How does this impact them?  Because again, there's close proximity in many cases.  Maybe Kate can comment on whether the original resolution, and subsequent ones, contemplated the extracurricular side of things."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I was wondering, Dave, if it makes sense to apply the same rules everywhere across all activities within the district.  Some of these extracurricular events are held outdoors, for instance. If they don't involve proximity to others, then maybe mask mandates wouldn't be necessary in those instances. Perhaps we could explore exemptions depending on the specific context of each activity. But for indoor activities where students are in closer proximity, possibly they wear masks. There may be flexibility possible here that respects the needs of our different programs and allows for adjustments based on circumstances."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "I understand Kate's point about making distinctions based on context. That seems reasonable. I do wonder though, if a universal approach simplifies things more. If students wear masks consistently throughout the day, maybe it minimizes confusion. Would we really expect teachers to police the varying settings where mask mandates apply, and which ones don't? The potential for inconsistent enforcement concerns me."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I think that is one thing to balance: consistency vs. adaptability to unique situations. I guess my thought process would be, let's take our best guidance from Dr. Patel, and then talk to educators about how they envision implementing this. We might uncover unforeseen challenges to what appears to be a straightforward solution today. I trust that together, we can determine how much flexibility we can reasonably build into this approach without compromising the essential intent."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Given that we're awaiting Dr. Patel's advice and broader stakeholder input, I propose that we table a final decision until our next meeting. In the meantime, the superintendent should work on devising a plan for mask breaks and addressing any logistics involving extracurricular activities. This approach ensures that everyone involved remains informed and aligned, ultimately leading to the most effective policy for our students and staff."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "I appreciate the thoughtful comments from my fellow board members.  Kate, your point about consistency versus adaptability resonates with me.  In my experience, a balanced approach often yields the best results.  I agree with Jon's proposal to table the decision until our next meeting, allowing us to gather more information and input. Meanwhile, I would like to task the superintendent to develop a comprehensive plan, including consideration of Dr. Patel's expertise, our counselor's insights, and the perspectives of other stakeholders. This plan should address the logistics of mask breaks, extracurricular activities, and any other relevant factors to ensure a well-rounded policy. By doing so, we can make an informed decision that prioritizes the well-being of our students and staff"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I strongly support Judy's tasking and Jon's proposal. It appears we all acknowledge the importance of Dr. Patel's input and other stakeholders, as well as the need for careful planning. In tabling our final decision, we give ourselves space to properly weigh competing considerations. Our deliberation demonstrates a commitment to finding the right balance of factors affecting our students and staff."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "I couldn't agree more, Judy and Kate. Tabling the decision until our next meeting gives us the opportunity to thoroughly review Dr. Patel's briefing, hear from our counselor, and consider the plan proposed by the superintendent. This approach ensures that we're making an informed decision that takes into account multiple perspectives. I believe our collective efforts will yield a well-balanced policy that safeguards the health and well-being of our students and staff while minimizing disruptions to their daily lives."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I second Judy and Kate and appreciate everyone's suggestions, comments, and questions regarding this matter. As Ellen stated earlier, this has been quite enlightening. With Dr. Patel set to brief us soon, followed by our counselor providing context about the emotional toll on children, I concur that we should wait for further input before making our decision on mandating face coverings. In conjunction with that, I recommend taking the following action items to consider when formulating our policy.  They include looking into extracurricular activities specifically; ensuring teacher buy-in on policies, which could help prevent inconsistent application; considering virtual alternatives or remote classes wherever feasible; incorporating some type of tracking system for student illness, quarantines, and reported COVID cases; maintaining"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Well said, Judy.  I concur with your suggestion to table this discussion until our next meeting.  My primary concern is implementing a mask mandate effectively, without leaving teachers to micromanage every different scenario. I'm open to hearing additional viewpoints before our final decision.  With the added insight of Dr. Patel and our counselor, I am confident that we'll produce a sound policy that works for everyone."
