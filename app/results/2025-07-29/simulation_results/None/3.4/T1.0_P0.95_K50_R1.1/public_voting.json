    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.4: Student Code of Conduct - The board will review proposed updates to the district\u2019s Student Code of Conduct, which outlines behavioral expectations and disciplinary procedures. Key changes include new rules around cell phone usage during instructional time, updates to the dress code to reflect inclusivity and professionalism, and revisions to disciplinary consequences to promote restorative practices.. Who would like to start?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I'll start because I have concerns about these changes in particular. It seems like they're coming up quite quickly. Can you explain why all of this is happening now and maybe what triggered the need for such rapid change?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Ah, Kate, thank you for bringing that up. I completely understand your concerns about the timing of these changes. To be honest, we've been noticing some issues with student behavior and distractions in the classroom, particularly with cell phone use, over the past year or so. And with the dress code, we've had some complaints from students and parents about it being too restrictive or biased towards certain groups. We didn't want to wait until next year to address these problems, especially since our student population is growing and changing rapidly. By making these updates now, we hope to set clear expectations and create a more positive learning environment for everyone. Does that make sense?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "So my question then is, and I think it's a very valid one, who did you consult when considering these changes? Was there input solicited from students, teachers, or any other stakeholders in the community? Were surveys conducted or focus groups held? Because right offhand, I don't see anything indicating that, you know?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I can answer that. What has happened thus far, Kate, was a committee formed within our central office staff that looked at the policy currently in place, and they began examining different policies across Virginia, even comparing them to those of nearby counties. There were specific discussions held with the middle school administrators regarding their experiences with technology and how cellphones have become increasingly prevalent during classes and its impact on instruction. When it comes to the dress code specifically, our diversity, equity, and inclusion team also reviewed the proposal to guarantee its language aligned with district values. Once the administration drafted the proposed modifications, an initial summary document was provided to division leaders to gather feedback, and we asked high school administrators if they noticed any patterns with incidents tied to the current policy."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I appreciate your thoroughness, Katrina, but to what extent did we actually involve students themselves in the process? How much real-time input did we get from people who are most affected by these rule changes - kids, especially high schoolers who are going to deal directly with stricter cellphone rules? Did we engage teachers who may have diverse perspectives on discipline methods? The restorative practices update seems reasonable, but without that ground-level understanding, these changes could possibly backfire. Or, worse still, simply fail to address root causes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Yes, we do rely heavily upon those individuals serving within our building-level leadership teams who work day-to-day alongside both students and staff members. They do hold open forums along with student governments to foster discussions about relevant policy updates like these, and these interactions do offer valuable opportunities to gather information from those folks' unique experiences. What I did hear though, Kate, when engaging educators in our schools was a strong message emphasizing consistency and predictability with rules in place, knowing that teachers often tailor approaches according to their own classroom settings or teaching styles while following established district guidelines. In terms of involving students, I agree wholeheartedly: That is a group where more input could certainly help strengthen the final product. While our district did have some representation on this internal"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "*interrupting* Excuse me, Katrina. It sounds like there should have been more meaningful, direct engagement with the student body and teaching force before drafting and proposing these significant changes. How could we expect these revised rules to resonate with kids who may already feel silenced or disengaged if we haven't sought out their thoughts and listened closely? It looks to me like this decision-making process overlooked a crucial stakeholder group and I worry about the unintended consequences. Is revisiting the timeline to incorporate deeper student involvement still a feasible option?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Well, Kate, that's something we absolutely should've done better on. You raise a vital concern, and I personally think including those voices earlier would have benefited us greatly. Unfortunately, given all the timelines and deadlines we work under as school officials, incorporating further input into the upcoming board vote isn't currently feasible for us. With that said, even once these updates take effect, we plan to continuously monitor student reactions and teacher perspectives through surveys and town hall-style meetings at least every semester. This way, we can continually refine the approach and improve upon potential issues as needed. Plus, it might provide guidance for potentially tweaking future policy drafts by hearing directly from key stakeholders."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "So, let me get this right, Katrina: The board votes on these updated conduct policies tonight, unaware of concrete feedback or data collected directly from those we serve \u2013 namely, high school students themselves, our very target demographic. In essence, you are advocating that we forge ahead, crossing fingers these measures effectively counter misbehaviors and support intended academic growth. Meanwhile, we'll evaluate their perceptions and opinions months after enacting these changes? That's unacceptable to me. If these modifications will really benefit the educational setting we care about, doesn't it warrant putting in extra effort upfront to truly involve students, teachers, and other vital voices?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I can understand your points, Kate. Honestly, I myself share concerns about insufficient early engagement from students and, I must admit, educators. Our lack of proactively seeking feedback does raise the potential for unanticipated problems. These modifications will indeed have an immediate effect on our young scholars. So maybe rethinking timelines for board consideration would enable us to go back and garner more information. Theoretically, the school board can decide tonight not to move forward and delay voting until we've collected more inclusive insights."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Kate Acuff: Alright, so does that mean you suggest revisiting, pushing this item back to another meeting, having the opportunity to delve deeper into getting input from all parties involved, Katrina? You just said yourself you can continue collecting data and revise accordingly later; we must consider taking the time to put this together properly, rather than hastily imposing new regulations without truly listening to our student constituency and staff. As board members, we've seen instances where that exact thing happens, leading to further discord."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Rightfully pointed out, Kate. So, a delay makes sense, and perhaps we're getting a little bit ahead of ourselves. Reaching out further can yield greater improvements down the line.  But also considering the pushbacks we experienced last year, Katrina, I think you mentioned, this decision cannot drag indefinitely either. A healthy compromise here might look like delaying tonight's vote slightly, granting maybe three weeks to a month for further input sessions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "It's quite clear, Katrina, we need time.   I am convinced a few additional weeks for gathering further perspectives ensures we strike closer to optimal solutions.  As you pointed out earlier, inaction can result in issues carrying over, which we cannot afford to happen.  We owe it to everybody involved to give them authentic opportunities for input and dialogue prior to the finalization of policy decisions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "For my part, Kate, a couple of my primary motivations centered on ensuring consistency throughout district operations and enhancing overall safety within our facilities. And, although some parts of this policy have gained attention, there were components focused on fostering positive relationships between students and administrative personnel. So hopefully those aspects won't be lost as we pause for reconsideration. Would we ultimately delay this board vote and instead provide that needed time for genuine collaboration moving forward."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "*nods emphatically in agreement* Thank you, David. Three weeks to a month will grant us ample time for in-depth consultation and constructive conversations with students and faculty to ensure their invaluable contributions truly influence policy refinements. By supporting a brief delay, we not only commit to embracing the concerns voiced today but also show the commitment required to make positive change a lasting reality for this district. Kate, it's time to listen deeply before acting decisively. I believe, too, Katrina, that you had initially brought forth solid reasons behind these policy considerations."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Ms. Jonnoalcaro here. Just two more questions. I'd like to follow up on Kate's comments earlier about having our next steps clarified. We should know what they will be in a situation such as when a student brings, possibly due to bullying, hate speech or some other prohibited language.  Do we need to update any procedures connected with reporting these cases?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "As suggested, it's crucial that there is clarity going forward on exactly how incidents like these unfold. While we take the necessary time to gather more feedback, can we please request that administration draft a revised protocol detailing the appropriate disciplinary steps the moment the school becomes aware of any incidents of hate speech, harassment, and bullying and submit it by the same deadline? This revised procedure document should detail both initial response strategies and ongoing support to affected students. We want the assurance of swift action whenever inappropriate behavior occurs within our schools."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "I agree with my fellow board members' concerns regarding the lack of student and teacher input in the updated conduct policies. Given the significance of these changes, it is essential that we hear directly from those who will be most impacted. Delaying the vote by three weeks to a month is a reasonable compromise, allowing us to collect more comprehensive feedback and refine the policies accordingly. Additionally, I endorse Kate's suggestion to request a revised protocol outlining the disciplinary steps for incidents of hate speech, harassment, and bullying. This document will provide much-needed clarity and reassurance for our students, parents, and educators. By taking the time to get this right, we demonstrate our commitment to creating a safe and supportive learning environment."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Now that we have a general consensus around temporarily tabling these proposed code of conduct revisions, I motion we reschedule this vote for our next board meeting in order to accommodate more robust community discussion, plus time for revised protocols that better encapsulate student and educator perspectives. Can we please direct school administrators to schedule focus groups with the student body, arrange input sessions with educators and send out surveys to engage the broader parent community within this specified timeframe, thereby fostering greater partnership, ownership and understanding across various stakeholders invested in improved conduct practices?"
