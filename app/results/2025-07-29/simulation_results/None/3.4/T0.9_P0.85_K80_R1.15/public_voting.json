    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.4: Student Code of Conduct - The board will review proposed updates to the district\u2019s Student Code of Conduct, which outlines behavioral expectations and disciplinary procedures. Key changes include new rules around cell phone usage during instructional time, updates to the dress code to reflect inclusivity and professionalism, and revisions to disciplinary consequences to promote restorative practices.. Who would like to start?"

    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I'd love to start this conversation about student code conduct. First off, thank you very much for all your work on these updates. I think there are some really important pieces here. Can we get more information on exactly what is changing with respect to cell phone policy? What does \"during instructional time\" mean specifically, for instance? And how do teachers handle phones being out if they're needed for educational purposes?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, Kate, for starting this conversation. To answer your question, when we say \"during instructional time,\" we're referring to any period where students are engaged in direct instruction, group work, or individual learning activities led by their teacher. This doesn't include lunch breaks, recess, or passing periods between classes. Regarding exceptions for educational purposes, our proposal allows teachers to grant permission for phone use during specific lessons or projects where devices are necessary tools. For example, if a math class needs calculators or a language arts project requires research online. Teachers will still have discretion to determine when phones can be used for legitimate academic reasons. We've also included guidelines for educators to establish clear expectations and protocols for phone use within their classrooms. Does that clarify"

  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thanks so much for that clarification, Ellen. That makes sense. One thing that caught my eye was the mention of restorative practices in the discipline section. Could someone walk us through what those might look like in practice? How will we ensure consistency across schools and teachers, particularly since it sounds like a pretty significant shift from traditional punishments? Are we providing training or support for staff who may need help implementing these kinds of approaches?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Absolutely, Kate. Restorative practices are an essential part of our updated Student Code of Conduct. In essence, these approaches focus on repairing harm, building empathy, and promoting personal growth rather than simply punishing misbehavior. Imagine a circle conversation after a conflict, where students involved discuss how they were affected, take responsibility, and work together to find a resolution. Or, instead of detention, a student reflects on their actions and creates a plan to make amends.\n\nTo ensure consistency, we'll provide professional development opportunities for our educators and administrators throughout the year. Our goal is to equip them with the skills and resources needed to implement restorative practices effectively. We're also developing a comprehensive guidebook that outlines best practices, scenarios, and case studies to support"

    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "It looks great. I did hear one comment that kind of made me feel sad because it had been going on at the high school level but not down at the lower levels and that was that we don't do enough recognition for kids who exhibit positive behavior. So I appreciate seeing that added into this draft and that was something, you know, to maybe even, you know, do better job of doing that on the elementary level where it seems like we could see that happening earlier. But overall, thank you for sharing these drafts with us and giving us a chance to talk about them."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "As Kate mentioned, thanks for bringing up restorative practices, Ellen. My concern is that we have quite a few educators who are already feeling overwhelmed with workload and responsibilities. Implementing new strategies takes time, especially ones requiring fundamental shifts in mindset and approach. How do you envision supporting our staff in terms of both initial and ongoing training as well as potentially realigning administrative duties to accommodate these practices?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Katrinea, I completely agree with you regarding recognizing positive behavior. By acknowledging and rewarding good choices, we can foster a more supportive and encouraging environment. I'm glad you appreciated the addition of this aspect in the revised Code of Conduct.\n\nDavid, your concerns about staff workload and support are absolutely valid. We understand that implementing restorative practices requires significant investment in our educators' professional development. We propose allocating dedicated funds for training sessions, workshops, and coaching tailored to our teachers' and administrators' unique needs. Additionally, we're exploring options for adjusting administrative tasks and roles to free up time for educators to focus on these new initiatives. Perhaps we can also identify existing staff members who have experience with restorative practices and utilize them as internal coaches or mentors"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Yes, I certainly appreciate your consideration for staff support. However, I'd like to delve deeper into specifics. Could we explore examples of concrete steps to alleviate the potential burden on our educators, such as reducing paperwork or reassigning certain duties? Furthermore, what is the projected timeline for this rollout, including training phases and milestones to track progress?"

    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Ms. Osborne has done an excellent job with this document. I just want to give her kudos for the amount of effort she put in. Two things stuck out at me. I think we should consider making sure that some type of parental involvement happens when there is a change in a child's status. It could be positive or negative. Just knowing what's going on in the classroom seems crucial for families. Secondly, there are places that the word \"may\" appears, suggesting optional actions. Is there a way we can strengthen that language to suggest greater expectation rather than possibility?  And, yes, restorative justice I think is a critical component, which will help build community within classrooms. But again, I believe there are still ways we could"

    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Hi everyone, I'd like to chime in on the topic of restorative practices. While I understand the importance of shifting away from punitive measures, I'm concerned about ensuring accountability and maintaining order in the classroom. Can we discuss how these practices will address repeat offenders or more serious incidents, such as bullying or physical altercations?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "You mentioned the inclusion of a guidebook outlining scenarios and case studies, Ellen. Have you considered involving actual educators in its development to ensure that it speaks directly to the challenges faced by teachers in the classroom? That would lend credibility and make implementation smoother."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "David, I completely understand your request for specificity. Let me assure you that we're committed to alleviating the burden on our educators. Some possible solutions we're considering include streamlining reporting processes, delegating tasks to support staff, and revising evaluation procedures to focus on quality over quantity. As for the rollout timeline, we're proposing a phased implementation, with initial training sessions beginning next semester and continuing throughout the following year. We'll set clear milestones and benchmarks to monitor progress and adjust our strategy accordingly.\n\nJon, thank you for your kind words! Parental involvement is indeed crucial, and we'll explore ways to enhance communication channels between home and school. Regarding the language, I agree that using stronger verbs like 'will' or'must' instead"

    "content": "Thank you very much for walking us through that, Ellen.  I mean, I thought it was interesting you brought up, that, the concept of punishment is always looked at as punishment rather than learning opportunity. I heard one comment that kind of made me feel sad because it had been going on at the high school level but not down at the lower levels and that was that we don't do enough recognition for kids who exhibit positive behavior.  So I appreciate seeing that added into this draft and that was something, you know, to maybe even, you know, do better job of doing that on the elementary level where it seems like we could see that happening earlier.

    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, Katrina. I couldn't agree more about recognizing positive behavior. It's essential to create a culture that encourages and celebrates good choices, especially at the elementary level where habits are formed. By acknowledging and rewarding positive behavior, we can promote a sense of community and mutual respect among students. I'm glad you appreciated the addition of this aspect in the revised Code of Conduct. It's crucial that we recognize the efforts of our students who consistently demonstrate kindness, empathy, and responsible behavior. This shift in focus will undoubtedly have a profound impact on our school climate."
