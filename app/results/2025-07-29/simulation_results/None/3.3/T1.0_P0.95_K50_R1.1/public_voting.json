    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.3: Technology Plan - The board will review a proposal to expand digital learning access by providing Chromebooks to every high school student. This initiative is estimated to cost $10,000 annually for devices, maintenance, and licensing. The program is designed to ensure equitable access to technology, support blended learning, and prepare students with digital skills for college and career readiness.. Who would like to start?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "How did you come up with the estimate of $10,000? Is that based on having done this type of project before, or did we have people bid out these services? I'm just concerned about whether we really know what it's going to cost."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Kate, those are excellent questions. Our IT department worked closely with a few vendors to get estimates for the devices, maintenance, and licensing costs. We also reached out to neighboring districts who have similar programs to gather information on their experiences and costs. While we can't anticipate every variable, I believe our estimate is a reasonable one. However, I agree that we should consider getting formal bids from vendors to ensure we're getting the best value for our money. Would it be possible to amend the proposal to include a bidding process before moving forward?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thank you for explaining how the estimate was developed. Having some real-world experience from nearby districts definitely helps. And I do agree that formal bidding would be wise. Could we build into this proposal that we'll have an evaluation committee made up of folks knowledgeable about edtech to assist in selecting the most suitable bidder? That would give me more comfort with the selection process."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "So first off, I want to say I think expanding equitable technology access is fantastic. One of my big concerns though is the fact that we're adding additional responsibilities to teachers' plates if we're planning on doing blended learning."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "To Katrina's point, yes, we need teachers' perspectives in terms of how they're going to adapt instruction to make best use of this new resource. Have we spoken to the teacher's union about all these implications? Do we know if the educators themselves feel ready for this move and do they support it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "I'd like to pose another question: what kind of training and assistance can we provide for both our teaching staff and the parents at home who may not be familiar with using Chromebooks? If we're going to put a device in each student's hands, then it seems imperative that they learn to make full advantage of it. Are there funds set aside for such professional development and parental guidance?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "I think Kate makes a great point about including an evaluation committee comprised of edtech experts. Their input would provide valuable insight in determining which vendor can deliver the best solution for our district. Additionally, Jon's comment about training and assistance resonates with me. It's crucial that our teachers and parents receive comprehensive support to ensure seamless integration. Has our administration considered partnering with local businesses or organizations to provide resources for professional development? Perhaps we could explore collaborative opportunities that would benefit both parties and lighten our financial burden."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I think it's an excellent idea for us to reach out to local businesses and orgs Judy. In fact, our Chamber of Commerce has often expressed interest in supporting education initiatives. Perhaps we could form some strategic partnerships that would allow for cost-sharing, expert input, or even job shadowing opportunities that could enhance the entire digital learning experience. With regard to teacher preparation, I wholeheartedly agree with David that engaging our educators early in the process is essential. And building on Jonathan's inquiry, does our budget also accommodate potential internet connectivity costs for students lacking reliable Wi-Fi access outside the classroom?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "I completely concur with the sentiments expressed so far.  Partnering with local businesses and organizations is indeed a fantastic way to share costs and bring in expertise. Our administration has already had preliminary discussions with the Chamber of Commerce, and they seem receptive to collaboration. As for teacher preparation, I've invited the teachers' union president to meet with us next week to discuss the proposal and address any concerns they may have. Regarding internet connectivity costs, yes, we do need to factor those in. In our initial research, we found that some internet service providers offer affordable plans for low-income families, and we're exploring ways to facilitate access to those options. Additionally, we might consider allocating a portion of our budget to provide mobile hotspots or other solutions for"

  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "We will need to work out the kinks in regards to the budget and planning because personally, I don't feel comfortable without knowing what it's costing us. Maybe Ms.  Osborn mentioned you have been speaking to neighboring districts and some other people that have had positive results. So,  we know that when it's well executed, it works quite well.  But to echo what some other folks have said, in terms of training for the teachers and making sure that's accessible and manageable for them is key as well as ensuring students aren't left behind. And again I think this ties back into the budget and cost in ensuring all students do have access to Wi-Fi at home or access to it via some alternative means. So, lots and"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Absolutely, Katrina. I understand your concerns about the budget and planning. Let me assure you that we'll work diligently to iron out the details and provide regular updates on the costs associated with this initiative. You're right; we do have successful models to draw upon from neighboring districts, and we're committed to replicating those successes here. Training for our teachers is paramount, and we'll allocate sufficient resources to ensure they feel confident and supported in incorporating blended learning into their instructional practices. Similarly, we recognize the importance of addressing the digital divide and will explore creative solutions to guarantee all students have reliable internet access, whether at home or through alternative arrangements. I propose we establish a task force to focus specifically on these aspects and provide regular progress reports to the board"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Before Ellen forms this taskforce, let me make sure that at least a couple of our current educators are part of that team because I truly believe the educator's perspective is invaluable here. They know exactly what they require to effectively teach, and involving them early in the process should yield a much smoother rollout and ensure that we're meeting their needs and ultimately, those of our students."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "I couldn't agree more, David.  Involving our educators in the task force is crucial. I was thinking along the same lines - having them serve as co-leads alongside our IT department and curriculum specialists. This collaboration will enable us to develop a comprehensive plan that addresses the needs of both our students and teachers. By working together, we'll create a sustainable model that ensures long-term success. Shall I reach out to the teacher's union to identify interested and qualified educators to participate in the task force?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Okay, just a quick question before that happens: Are we going to set specific goals and objectives for that task force, so they're focused and directed from day one?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "The suggestion sounds well-reasoned and proactive. I recommend setting targets and deadlines, and requesting regular status updates. That would give the task force direction, and us, the board, the opportunity to track its progress. Ellen, would it be possible for the task force to provide quarterly evaluations detailing the achievements, challenges faced, and steps forward?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Excellent questions, gentlemen! Yes, I concur that setting specific goals and objectives for the task force is essential to its success. I envision a clear charter outlining their responsibilities, milestones, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Quarterly evaluations are a great idea, Jon. I propose we schedule regular check-ins with the task force leaders to review their progress, address any challenges, and provide guidance as needed. This will keep everyone informed and aligned throughout the implementation process. I'll work with the task force leads to develop a detailed scope of work and timeline, which we can review and approve during our next board meeting."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "If the task force provides quarterly evaluations with measurable targets, I think it would be helpful if those metrics are somehow tied back to student outcomes.  How do we plan on measuring the impact of this project on student achievement, particularly for those who historically struggle with technology-based instruction?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "I'd like to chime in on that last point, Jon. Measuring the impact on student achievement is crucial. Perhaps we can use existing assessment data, such as standardized test scores or grades, to gauge the effectiveness of this blended learning approach. It might also be beneficial to conduct surveys or gather feedback from students, parents, and teachers to gain a more nuanced understanding of how this initiative affects our students. And, David, I appreciate your emphasis on involving our educators in the task force. Their insights will undoubtedly prove invaluable in shaping a successful strategy. What are your thoughts on potentially including a parent representative in the task force as well?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Judy, including a parent representative on the task force could definitely foster greater community engagement. Having someone who represents parental perspectives will help ensure we're considering the implications for students outside the classroom. My concern, though, lies in striking the right balance between representation and avoiding any potential biases or single-issue advocates on the task force. Could we perhaps open up a call for volunteers and choose a parent representative based on merit and their ability to collaborate constructively with the rest of the task force? That way, we bring in diverse viewpoints while keeping our primary focus on improving educational outcomes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Ah, David, I see your point about finding the right balance. Opening up a call for volunteers and selecting a parent representative based on merit makes sense. We want someone who can engage productively with the task force and provide valuable input, rather than advocating for a particular agenda. Perhaps we can also involve our PTA or PTSA organization in the selection process to ensure we're reaching a broader range of parents and getting the best possible candidate. What do others think about this approach?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I wholeheartedly agree that our district has made some really good strides, but it cannot happen without a lot of people's efforts. Thank you, Katrina and David, for raising points. One of my concerns here is cost-effectiveness. If I were to see where we place our money, making sure that we're being responsible stewards, and then secondly making certain that we get buy-in and support from each sector, from administrators, teachers and staff, students and families."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Kate, I completely understand your concerns about cost-effectiveness. As we move forward with this initiative, I plan to work closely with our finance department to ensure that we're allocating resources efficiently and effectively. I'd like to suggest that we establish a separate budget line item for this project, allowing us to track expenses and make adjustments as needed.\n\nRegarding buy-in and support, I agree that it's crucial to have all stakeholders on board. To that end, I propose that we develop a comprehensive communication plan, including regular updates via our website, social media, and direct outreach to families. This will help build awareness, generate enthusiasm, and encourage participation from everyone involved."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I think that would be a very good idea."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Hi, thank you, Ms. Osborne. I guess I just wanted to add real quickly, when we start looking at teacher training and stuff, we should probably also be thinking about how we're gonna support those same teachers once the new system comes online. So we're not just preparing them upfront, but we're also supporting them. And then I guess the other thing was to maybe add was the need to also continue and improve on those wraparound services which would likely be essential in this scenario if it works. And also, Ellen, did I hear correctly that the timeline is roughly through December?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Yes, Katrina, you heard correctly. Our target implementation date is by the end of this calendar year, so roughly December. And I appreciate your emphasis on ongoing support for our teachers once the new system is in place. We must ensure they feel confident and empowered to leverage these tools effectively. I'll make sure to prioritize teacher support and development in our planning. Additionally, your mention of wraparound services resonates with me. We need to consider how our counseling and social services teams can adapt to this new model, providing necessary support for students who may require additional assistance. These are excellent points, Katrina. Thank you for bringing them to the forefront."
