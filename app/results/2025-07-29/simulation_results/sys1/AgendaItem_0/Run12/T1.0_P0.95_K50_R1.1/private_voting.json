    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.1: COVID Mask Policy - The board will discuss the district\u2019s COVID-19 health protocols, specifically whether students should be required to wear masks while in classrooms. This policy would apply during the regular school day, with exceptions for lunch and designated mask-break periods. The goal is to balance student safety with comfort and learning effectiveness.. Who would like to start?"

    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "I would love to initiate the dialogue. As an educator, the most important aspect right now is student well-being and safety. With that in mind, what I think we really need to look at are some of the studies that talk about how masking has effectively helped not only our students but also our staff members within those schools. If you take a glance at last year's results, as hard as it was, the district took measures to protect both students and staff, which in my estimation is the number one priority. We do that by masking up. At the very least, if it helps reduce transmission rates as indicated by our local health officials and other research on this topic, then I believe that it becomes an obligation for us. By doing so, we can ensure our students can actually stay here attending classes safely. I am thinking there needs to be ongoing updates from our superintendent related to COVID case numbers inside and outside school walls and I propose we make these available to all families and staff who work for the district. Additionally, I recommend giving flexibility to school administrators who deal directly with specific challenges they have based on where they're at in their learning spaces and capacities. And so we need to collaborate more to find ways to make masks more comfortable because they will stay effective even though people don't necessarily enjoy wearing them. But again, the top priority for me should always remain health."

    "content": "Thank you, Mr. Alcaro.  I think another piece of this is making sure families understand why decisions are being made and having an understanding of the factors going into that decision. So we've heard a lot of feedback around both sides of the coin about wearing masks in school. There are times when we have to pivot. For example, in the past, we had more significant outbreaks throughout the winter. But then after that, we could take off the masks again as the case counts dropped below thresholds that indicated that the threat level decreased. In essence, these are data-based choices we're trying to weigh together. We need to explain this thought process behind it and provide clear communication that shows we're watching the numbers and responding accordingly. We are responsible for creating guidelines for schools that serve close to 10,000 young students, many with comorbidities such as autoimmune conditions. How to best address these concerns remains critical.\n```zh-dhpnlulqstzwhaeg```\ndavidoberg: So I want to say something regarding the exception policies.  If the parents sign a letter stating they do not approve of the mandatory mask-wearing rule, then perhaps exempt them from this rule with the caveat that students attend online and won't come to campus until all restrictions are lifted.  That way the parent is making a conscious choice in the face of some information about risks involved but we maintain some semblance of a safe environment at the school sites with respect for each household. Kate Acuff, will you remind those folks who are interested in speaking publicly that the link was included in the agenda packet? Or they simply may go to speak up albemarle.org so let the user share thoughts or upload comments if that suits better.  Those who plan to participate via zoom, when you log onto Zoom please use your first name, your last name and indicate whether you're a parent or community member. It is helpful for all our recorders and other users to locate participants' comments.\nkatie: Kate Acuff. Absolutely happy to help with any public comment speakers. If someone wants to speak live either virtually through Zoom tonight or leave a recorded voicemail just type \"speakup@albemarleschools.org\" in your browser. Please keep the voice messages under 3 minutes long and ensure audio quality is acceptable before hanging up. All statements will be linked into our summary document which is part of the minutes to ensure full documentation."

    "content": "Also, just to add that we'll also accept written comments submitted electronically prior to the deadline given. We can review everything carefully later tonight and incorporate any additional perspectives provided through the various methods Dr. Oberg described.  Now, back to policy itself, has anyone considered looking over different models adopted in neighboring counties and the state to create a best practice for us locally?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Yes, Kate, absolutely, researching neighboring counties and statewide practices is vital in determining our approach. While considering this, we must remember that every district faces unique circumstances; thus, adopting a tailored strategy addressing Albemarle County's distinct needs is crucial. I suggest creating a subcommittee to delve deeper into exploring successful implementations regionally and assessing feasibility for our locality."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Committee formation sounds reasonable. Within that analysis, can we prioritize districts similar in size, demographics, and urban-rural mix to ours, rather than focusing solely on proximity? Furthermore, does anybody know whether VDOE offers guidelines or recommendations on mask mandates at the state level that could inform our deliberations?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Excellent points, Kate. Indeed, VDOE does offer guidance on mitigation strategies, including mask-wearing. It would be beneficial to examine their recommendations and incorporate them into our decision-making process. In terms of committee formation, prioritizing demographically similar districts will enable us to draw more accurate parallels and apply relevant lessons learned. Additionally, I suggest involving stakeholders from various segments of our community in this subcommittee to ensure diverse perspectives are represented and valued. This inclusive approach will ultimately strengthen our policy decisions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Great point Judy. Adding diverse stakeholders ensures we capture varied viewpoints that enrich discussion. Also, how about including experts with backgrounds in epidemiology or related fields to lend expertise on safety metrics and effective responses? Their input would bolster evidence-based decision-making. Finally, shall we outline potential subcommittee tasks, e.g., reviewing COVID-19 cases and transmission data, studying existing policy approaches, identifying key performance indicators (KPIs), and weighing stakeholder feedback?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Exactly, Kate! Incorporating experts with epidemiological expertise will significantly enhance our understanding of safety metrics and inform our response strategies. I concur with outlining subcommittee tasks, including reviewing case data, examining policy approaches, establishing KPIs, and analyzing stakeholder input. Additionally, the subcommittee could explore options for ongoing monitoring and assessment to ensure adaptability in our responses as the pandemic evolves."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "It seems like there's growing consensus around engaging experts, incorporating diverse voices, and outlining responsibilities. Next steps, Graham might be assigning membership, a chairperson, and timelines for their work. In parallel, Dr. Osborne, could your team collaborate with the Health Department to gather pertinent COVID-19 data for the committee's analysis? And, is there already a tentative timeline to reconvene and discuss possible mask policy changes?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Absolutely, Kate. Our team will work closely with the Health Department to provide the necessary COVID-19 data for the subcommittee's analysis. We'll ensure the data is accurate, timely, and comprehensive, enabling informed decision-making. Regarding the timeline, I propose we aim to reconvene in four weeks to discuss the subcommittee's findings and potential policy revisions. This allows sufficient time for the subcommittee to conduct its analysis and makes it feasible to implement any changes before the next semester begins."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "That sounds like a sound proposal, Ellen. Four weeks gives ample time for thorough research and consideration without delaying implementation too much. David, would this timeline align with your vision? Would having an adjusted policy in place for second semester begin to have a significant impact on infection rates?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "I agree that a four-week timeline is reasonable, Kate. Implementing potential policy adjustments before the new semester begins is essential, as it'll allow us to minimize disruptions and establish a clear direction for the remainder of the academic year. By then, we should have a more definitive picture of COVID-19 trends, which will help guide our decision-making process."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thanks, David. One last question to ensure equity access for everyone: Are we planning to make remote participation available for subcommittee meetings to increase the diversity of perspectives?  Also, how do we envision documenting and sharing meeting outcomes publicly to maintain transparency throughout this process?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Absolutely, Kate. We will indeed make remote participation available for subcommittee meetings, leveraging technology to engage a broader range of stakeholders and promote inclusivity. As for transparency, I recommend regular updates via our website, social media channels, and email notifications to keep the community informed about the subcommittee's progress and findings. Meeting summaries, documents, and recordings will be accessible online, ensuring accountability and openness throughout the process."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thank you, David. That plan promotes transparent communication and accessibility, fostering trust within the community. I move that we adopt these measures to ensure our decision-making process is open, well-informed, and socially responsible. Seconded by all, please indicate if you're in favor, opposed, or abstaining. If passed, we proceed with forming the subcommittee per Graham's suggested composition."
