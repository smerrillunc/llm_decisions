Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.1: COVID Mask Policy - The board will discuss the district\u2019s COVID-19 health protocols, specifically whether students should be required to wear masks while in classrooms. This policy would apply during the regular school day, with exceptions for lunch and designated mask-break periods. The goal is to balance student safety with comfort and learning effectiveness.. Who would like to start?"

    "content": "I'll go first if that works out okay. We've been following local case rates closely as well as state guidance from VDH. As you know we have seen a significant increase over recent weeks which has led us into high transmission territory again according to CDC metrics. So our current risk assessment suggests it may not yet be safe enough at present time without some precautions such as masking indoors. What do others think about where things stand right now? Do they agree with my interpretation here based upon what Dr. Osborne shared earlier today regarding those numbers? And then there are also other factors beyond just raw cases per se; how comfortable can kids feel within their own schools knowing classmates could still potentially bring something back home even after being vaccinated themselves because no vaccine offers complete protection against all variants currently circulating around town either. It seems reasonable given these considerations along with ongoing research supporting indoor use by both children & adults alike \u2013 especially considering more than half of them haven't received shots so far anyway --that wearing face coverings inside buildings remains an important tool available to help mitigate potential spread until further notice. Thank you very much. Now let me hear your thoughts please!"

    "content": "Thanks Jon. That was really helpful context setting. One thing I'd add before opening up comments broadly is that one concern expressed through parent feedback sessions held recently were concerns related to impact on instruction delivery quality when teachers need to speak loudly above background noise levels due to muffled voices behind masks. How might we address teacher voice strain issues going forward assuming continued mandates remain necessary moving ahead? Kate Acuff had mentioned she wanted to say something too but wasn\u2019t sure who went next. Would anyone else care to weigh-in initially prior to hearing her perspective? Or perhaps Ms. Cuff wants to jump straight away since she did express interest already speaking briefly moments ago? Please proceed accordingly thank you!\n```"

    "content": "Thank you very much David Oberg. Good morning everyone again. Yes indeed, thank you Mr. Alcaro too because he was talking about some other things but then turned back to me which made my heart skip a beat just briefly anyway. But good morning everybody. And what's really important here today is not only do we have high levels right now compared to where they were last spring, but even though vaccination efforts continue to increase, hospitalizations remain higher than ever seen previously. We're seeing increased cases everywhere including Albemarle County Public School facilities. In fact, yesterday alone saw six positive tests out of twenty-one conducted staff testing events resulting in five percent positivity rate exceeding state average currently standing near three point seven percent. Our goal remains ensuring safe learning environments conducive to academic success focusing primarily on supporting children through layered mitigation measures proven effective against viral spread. It starts foremost with universal masking indoors regardless whether vaccinated or non-vaccinated individuals alike. The American Academy Pediatrics recommends masks worn correctly covering nose mouth areas reducing respiratory droplets expelled containing virus particles thereby limiting exposure risks faced others nearby. Other methods include social distancing cohorting contact tracing enhanced ventilation air purification units installed inside classrooms improving filtration quality monitoring disease activity regularly updating guidance documents shared publicly accessible via website links posted online. By adopting multi-prong approaches grounded firmly scientific consensus recommendations issued credible health organizations locally regionally worldwide, ACPS stands poised confidently navigating pandemic challenges confronting educational institutions head-on providing necessary support structures enabling successful teaching practices ultimately fostering healthy productive classroom climates benefiting entire student bodies equally without exception. Thanks for your attention. Do any board members wish to pose questions prior to hearing public comment statements submitted electronically read aloud shortly afterwards? Or maybe perhaps Ms. Colson might want to add something she'd prefer saying herself rather than having someone say her statement instead please go ahead either one.
