Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.1: COVID Mask Policy - The board will discuss the district\u2019s COVID-19 health protocols, specifically whether students should be required to wear masks while in classrooms. This policy would apply during the regular school day, with exceptions for lunch and designated mask-break periods. The goal is to balance student safety with comfort and learning effectiveness.. Who would like to start?"

    "content": "Good afternoon. To frame my comments: When considering our COVID masking policy I think it is important we remain vigilant about protecting one another, particularly given that our vaccination rates are still climbing. It bears pointing out that all that being said, as a system, our case counts continue to track upward over time. In fact, the trend line indicates that the total active cases in our schools have steadily risen over the last few weeks. We owe it to ourselves, staff members, teachers, learners, families, along with each other to ensure we're creating conditions where every person feels safe enough to effectively do what they came here for. Is there any evidence showing how effective mask wearing could help mitigate further transmission within our school environments?. Can someone present those findings now so we may take those into consideration for today's decision-making process?"

    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thank you Jon,  I appreciate your thorough analysis. To address your request, I'll review some data on the topic from experts like the American Academy of Pediatrics, CDC, and World Health Organization regarding the role of mask-wearing in mitigating transmission. Dr. Kate A cuff will elaborate as well. To summarize thus far: According to peer-reviewed sources cited by these organizations, face coverings can reduce the emission rate of respiratory droplets containing viral particles. This reduces the amount of virus spread via respiratory transmissions. This includes both inhalation via air exposure and contact through fomites via touching contaminated surfaces. So to answer your question directly Jon: Yes, multiple lines of data suggest that when coupled with other mitigation practices, mandatory face covering usage offers us a useful tool against transmission, though certainly not foolproof. Furthermore, at this point no single solution seems perfect but in combination these tools increase their value synergistically.  Are there more specific aspects of the issue anybody here would like me or Dr. Acuff to address?\n```"

    "content": "Thank you Katrina for providing those insights.  As we consider the importance of student well-being and the effectiveness of mask-wearing in reducing transmission risks, I'd like to add that we shouldn't forget our most vulnerable populations within the student body. Children with underlying health conditions and those living with immunocompromised family members must be a focus of our concern. Ensuring that we implement policies that prioritize their safety and provide equal opportunities for them to learn and grow should remain paramount in our decision-making. Dr. Cuff, if possible, could you share any information about how masks might benefit these particular student groups?"

    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thank you, David, for highlighting the critical need to center our most vulnerable students in this decision. Dr. Cuff, please do share your insights on how masks can support these students. Additionally, I'd like to ask: Have we explored potential accommodations for students who may struggle with mask-wearing due to sensory or anxiety issues? What measures can we put in place to ensure inclusivity and accessibility for all students?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Absolutely, Judy. I completely agree that we cannot lose sight of the diverse needs of our students.  Mask-wearing can indeed offer an extra layer of protection for students who are immunocompromised or have other health concerns. However, we must also acknowledge that certain students may experience difficulty with mask compliance due to sensory processing issues, anxiety, or other reasons. We should explore alternatives such as clear masks, providing masks in different textures, or allowing for short breaks in designated areas. Moreover, we could consider having an opt-out provision with medical documentation or exploring alternative solutions like desk shields for those students who cannot tolerate masks. It's crucial that we strike a balance between safety and accommodations to ensure full participation for all our students."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, Kate, for outlining those crucial considerations. I'd like to emphasize that our discussion must prioritize equity and inclusivity, ensuring that our policies do not disproportionately impact certain student groups. As we weigh the benefits of mask-wearing against potential challenges, let's also consider the long-term implications of our decisions on student wellbeing and academic performance. Have we examined any research on the impact of prolonged mask-wearing on students' mental health, social skills, and overall learning experiences? How can we effectively monitor and address any adverse effects, especially for our most vulnerable students?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Excellent points, Ellen. Our team has reviewed studies indicating that prolonged mask-wearing may lead to increased anxiety, decreased social skills, and compromised mental health outcomes. Moreover, students with pre-existing trauma, English language learners, or those with communication disorders might be disproportionately affected. To mitigate these consequences, we propose regular check-ins, surveys, and monitoring systems to identify students struggling with the mask mandate. By leveraging teacher feedback, parent input, and student self-reporting, we can respond proactively and tailor interventions to individual needs. Additionally, incorporating social-emotional learning modules, mindfulness exercises, and group activities that foster connection can help offset potential negative impacts on mental health and social skills. Let's commit to ongoing evaluation and adaptation to ensure our responses meet the evolving needs of our students."

  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Thanks so much Kate, Ellen and others who've contributed. Our collective understanding is that mandating masks does appear to play a significant part in the suite of strategies available for decreasing transmission risks while facilitating continued in-person education. There isn't a silver bullet, however combining several approaches raises the effectiveness significantly. It seems that we should strive to achieve a balanced approach addressing concerns around equity, inclusion, and exceptions and accommodations alongside that of reducing transmission risk. For that reason, I recommend moving forward with a required masking policy to supplement existing measures currently in place. The caveat: our implementation plan ought to incorporate measures that minimize difficulties with compliance among our most vulnerable learners, considering alternative options and ongoing assessments to adapt the policy according to emerging findings. Dr. Cuff, Graham Page can you flesh out those details and offer a timeline to roll out such a comprehensive initiative?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Jon, thank you for summarizing this nuanced and multifaceted conversation. I believe we're close to achieving a consensus based on available evidence from experts and prioritizing student well-being. Regarding implementation and enforcement, Graham and Kate will present detailed recommendations. But before they do, let's emphasize that consistent communication remains vital throughout. Parents, guardians, teachers, school staff, and most importantly, students themselves, will require guidance on what's expected under our mask mandate. We'll post signage, distribute educational materials, hold workshops, and engage local community partnerships in disseminating essential messaging across all channels to ensure seamless understanding. When presenting our rollout strategy and timeline, it would be beneficial, Kate and Graham, if you were to touch upon our expectations for active monitoring and regular reassessments of our policy's effectivenss vis-a-vis ongoing transmission rates. That said, time-sensitive questions still linger about equitable distribution of PPE resources to schools across various socioeconomic zones in our county. Would our task force on Resource Allocation please take note of this gap in preparation for our meeting next week? We shall review current resource availability and formulate potential mitigation plans to address these disparities. Your input on that point would be very valuable, Ellen. Are there other remaining concerns not yet addressed before we proceed with Dr. Acuff's and Mr. Page's operational plans?"

    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Kate and Graham, I'm grateful for your thorough consideration of the complexities surrounding mask-wearing and the necessity of tailored support for vulnerable students. Before we proceed with implementing our policy, I'd like to request that we allocate specific funds within our budget for providing alternative accommodations and resources for students requiring exceptional assistance. This investment would demonstrate our commitment to equity and uphold our responsibility to each student's unique needs. Would the task force consider this financial allocation in their planning, Ellen?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "David, I wholeheartedly endorse your suggestion to earmark funds for accommodating students with exceptional needs. It's essential that we walk the talk on equity and inclusivity by allocating necessary resources to support our most vulnerable students. Ellen, please add this to the task force's agenda for their review and planning."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Absolutely, Judy and David. I completely agree that dedicated funding for accommodations is critical to ensure equal access and support for our students. Graham and I will incorporate this requirement into our implementation plan, including budget allocations for alternative masks, staff training, and accommodations for students with special needs. In terms of the rollout strategy and timeline, we propose a three-phased approach. First, we'll develop and distribute clear guidelines, signage, and educational materials by the end of this week. Next, we'll provide training and support for teachers and school staff on effective implementation, monitoring, and accommodations during the following two weeks. Finally, we'll launch the mandatory mask policy at the start of the third week, coinciding with the distribution of masks and alternative accommodations to all schools. Throughout this process, we'll maintain open communication channels with parents, students, and staff, soliciting feedback and conducting regular assessments to refine our approach as needed. Ellen, I appreciate your task force's focus on resource allocation, particularly regarding disparities in PPE distribution across our county's socioeconomic zones. We must address these inequities head-on to ensure every student has equal access to the necessary resources for success."

  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, Kate, for outlining the phased implementation plan and timeline. I agree that dedicating funds for accommodations is crucial to supporting our most vulnerable students. I'll ensure the task force reviews and incorporates this allocation into their planning. Additionally, I suggest we establish a dedicated hotline or email channel for reporting concerns or seeking clarifications on the mask mandate, which can be monitored by our task force. This will enable us to quickly respond to emerging issues and make data-driven adjustments to our policy. Graham, could you elaborate on how we can effectively monitor and assess the impact of the mask mandate on transmission rates and student wellbeing, ensuring our response remains informed and adaptable?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "We need to monitor transmission rates through case tracking by school, looking at positivity rates over time, along with reports from school nurses on symptoms they're seeing.  Also, surveys for parent-guardian and teacher sentiment would provide insight into mask efficacy. And to assess student wellbeing, regular social-emotional check-ins through daily temperature checks and counselor availability should help track levels of anxiety, frustration, and feelings of isolation. Our goal is to understand and proactively respond to the overall health and wellness climate within our learning environments. With that information, our Reopening Task Force can stay responsive and adapt to changes that may influence the mask policy over time.   As an outcome, we should also analyze whether the mask policy contributes to increased attendance rates, as students feel more comfortable returning to classrooms and participating fully in educational opportunities.  So, we expect to examine metrics and sentiments at multiple angles.  All voices matter when it comes to identifying areas to improve and making sure every single student can learn confidently amidst conditions presented by this unprecedented pandemic."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Excellent outline, Graham! I completely agree that a multi-faceted approach to monitoring and assessment is essential. By tracking case rates, surveying stakeholders, and conducting social-emotional check-ins, we'll have a comprehensive understanding of the mask policy's effectiveness and its impact on student wellbeing. I especially appreciate the emphasis on examining the relationship between the mask policy and attendance rates. It's crucial that we identify any correlations and adjust our strategies accordingly. To further enhance our monitoring efforts, I recommend that we establish a dashboard to visualize key metrics and trends, enabling real-time analysis and swift decision-making. This will facilitate collaboration among our task forces and ensure that we're adapting to the evolving pandemic landscape. What are your thoughts on incorporating a dashboard into our monitoring framework, Graham?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Ellen, that sounds absolutely wonderful. I'm totally sold on the dashboard concept because we've got such a great team capable of developing that. A visual representation of metrics will streamline decision-making.  From what we heard tonight, with different layers of complexity woven into the picture, a dashboard just gives us that easy snapshot with drill-down capabilities.  Then when we pull something apart we'll be able to say, 'Hey, wait a minute. What do you mean, or why did that particular school show up with higher rates?' This leads me right back to equity where maybe a lack of PPE in schools was creating issues. It will be so much better once we roll everything together, getting some transparency and visibility with how well things operate. And I think it's fantastic too that Dr. Haas came out strong in saying our kids in school may want more access to technology than others that were there and we can't let them down when we look at their future because what you really have is kids going to work who aren't quite prepared from a digital literacy standpoint. I worry about those kids.  So now we're talking about building the plane while flying it but this one is going to make a difference because the more we learn from this experience, the better chance we have of pulling in another five years.  The idea gets people excited around making that promise work for all kids rather than simply certain groups. If all this was done right, no wonder we would go back to exactly what we're doing now, we would be in some kind of hybrid with a lot of choices if we had enough equipment for teachers who love teaching virtually because they found ways to connect virtually. Then what you might have is some students in math who want virtual with no problem and we could accommodate that model moving forward as a part of the way we teach. If you put those kinds of components together with choice-based systems, this pandemic does create an opportunity that I never thought I'd ever find my way back to, something to save public education even though it was underfunded for decades. This system may make sure it thrives because at the end of the day if all you're worried about was cost per student instead of the dollar value that it takes to do it differently, so maybe a new generation says okay, I didn't learn anything different from what we've been doing and it is time we took this risk.  How is that possible and what would it mean for that next year? Why"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Graham, I couldn't agree more about the potential for transformative change in our education system. Your vision for a hybrid model with choice-based systems resonates deeply with me. By leveraging technology and innovation, we can create a more equitable, personalized, and effective learning environment that meets the diverse needs of our students. I believe this pandemic has accelerated our thinking around education reform, and we must seize this opportunity to reimagine what's possible. To build on your idea, I propose we establish a working group focused on exploring these innovative approaches and identifying potential pilots for the upcoming academic year. This group can comprise educators, administrators, students, and community representatives to ensure a collaborative and inclusive design process. By working together, we can co-create a bold new vision for education that prioritizes student-centered learning, digital equity, and flexibility. Let's harness the energy and creativity generated by this crisis to drive meaningful change that benefits all students, regardless of zip code or socioeconomic status. Kate, what are your thoughts on this proposal, and how can we ensure that our working group is representative of the diverse perspectives needed to inform this effort?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thank you, Ellen. Graham's ideas for the hybrid model resonate deeply with me, too. The notion of students having agency over their own learning pathway, choosing between in-person and virtual instruction, speaks to our commitment to equity and inclusion. We need to explore how the pandemic offers us a chance to reorganize resources and focus on a more equitable education delivery model moving forward. Concerning Graham's remarks about teacher support and digital literacy, perhaps David Oberg could elaborate on what we're currently considering to address teacher training in terms of digital tool proficiency and the support infrastructure required to allow our staff to grow alongside this evolving model efficiently. Graham, your point about funding gets right to the heart of our systemic constraints. How might we prioritize equity through budget allocations so that underserved communities benefit most from our reimagined educational strategy? As far as establishing a new workgroup, count me as enthusiastic for pursuing a partnership across our district administration, teachers, parents, local community partners and, especially importantly, students. To guarantee the workgroup represents a cross-section of voices, we should hold an application period and set specific seats aside for student and parent representatives with an aim toward broad coverage geographically, socioeconomically and along racial lines within our region."

  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Thank you, Kate. That comprehensive approach to representation sounds fantastic for fostering inclusivity. I truly appreciate Graham's vision for education and Ellen's desire to actualize it. Just looking ahead to how we implement this vision within the confines of COVID, I think I still get concerned about the mask-wearing piece which may not solve itself with this plan. If everyone had masks when we opened in September last year, this concern probably wouldn't exist. There might be some people who wear their mask incorrectly; then there are kids who will be kids, playfully forgetting occasionally despite best efforts to instill habits, then unfortunately sometimes folks don't follow through or take off after entering school buildings. If this is still around come August 2022, that's a major safety issue if I understand Judy Le's comments properly. In order to give credence to the board about that, we'd likely have to demonstrate real-world success somewhere else in implementing this policy effectively. Is there already a case study which suggests successfully enforcing mask mandates while keeping K-through-twelve operating for long periods without COVID cases multiplying out of control? In all honesty, I've become doubtful of such instances since no one seems willing to mention any yet. It does matter if the research points against masks being incredibly effective in containing spread because kids' social distancing discipline might also vary wildly, particularly among younger grades where students struggle to abide. With respect to Dr. Haas, as far as kids wanting devices goes, he makes perfect sense. How can we guarantee our district won't be left with tech debt five years down the road and that our students keep the ability to navigate both worlds, brick-and-mortar and online classes seamlessly? Can any member of the team provide information about possible options like long-term leasing that protect taxpayers' interests while ensuring fair opportunities and equality amongst students in resource access? Finally, we certainly know we still need guidance clarifying the parameters of special circumstances like English-language learners, IEPs, exceptionalities, as well as students receiving special services outside school premises. We can work further on that with community collaboration input once we solidify what that final piece looks like from both sides of the table. Is it true that we need additional federal direction before we can fully hammer these exceptions out during an ongoing situation? Or how are districts such as ours navigating them in creative ways given existing rules and guidelines right now? Thanks for the opportunity to ask for some help on both fronts moving forward today, because I truly believe we"

    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "John Noah Alcaro, yes we do have evidence around effective policies. The World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control, and the Virginia Department of Health have developed strong recommendations regarding wearing facial coverings in public places, as well as in schools, including preK and K through 12. And indeed studies indicate that mask-wearing decreases transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by reducing respiratory droplets released into the air. Yes we should look at implementation experiences elsewhere. And as Kate mentioned earlier, Fairfax County Public Schools in Virginia successfully implemented mask mandates throughout their schools. If we were planning for that option here, the critical key elements include clear communication, proper supervision, and reinforcement of good hygiene practices. Our health department leaders would need to develop procedures for proper disposal of masks, and how frequently they should be replaced. So we'd definitely need to engage those kinds of conversations locally to make sure that it aligns with our unique context, should we choose to pursue masks. I believe it's crucial that before we jump into any specific measures we discuss how we're supporting teachers in teaching all manner of courses virtually but in addition, also learn how to manage classroom dynamics differently to emphasize the health protocols at hand, rather than just layering those over their traditional instructional routine. Then in regards to whether there are enough alternatives available that allow every student equal access to technology for hybrid learning or distance learning models, one approach explored is partnerships with tech companies offering lower cost products or purchasing refurbished computers that will give our district leverage for bulk purchases."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I agree with Katrina about exploring alternative tech solutions, and we can definitely invite industry experts to explore potential partnerships, as was done in Montgomery County Public Schools. What I'm curious about is whether there isn't room for short-term strategies here that mitigate the immediate risks associated with inequitable digital access, such as repurposing some of our existing facilities for students lacking devices or stable internet connectivity. Are there similar options available for facilitating safe, socially distanced learning environments on school property for those students unable to participate digitally? To ensure clarity, for those special circumstance categories Jon Noel referenced \u2013 IEPs, ELLs, etc., how can we involve those directly affected families in the development process to better meet these individual needs? This input could lead us towards more targeted problem-solving and foster deeper empathy for these unique situations while crafting tailored solutions. In parallel, Judy, based on what you expressed concerning our understanding of the ever-evolving nature of pandemic circumstances, and its impact upon instruction time and academic calendars: could we establish flexible triggers for adjustments to our operations, which informally incorporate the metrics used to assess overall risk levels? If so, how much flexibility does the state offer us to pivot between different operational scenarios and still maintain compliance with our state-mandated curricula requirements? This could ultimately allow us greater freedom to maneuver as needed while sustaining academic rigor and preserving safety conditions for our students and educators alike."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thank you, Katy.  I completely concur that it's essential to explore innovative, multi-layered approaches.  Repurposing existing facilities for those who lack digital resources is an idea worth pursuing. Let's consider setting up temporary 'Learning Hubs,' possibly even partnering with local libraries or community centers.  With respect to incorporating family input, absolutely; we must prioritize empathetic understanding when addressing these unique situations. As we move ahead, I suggest we create focused advisory boards comprising representatives from each group requiring accommodations. Their valuable insights will help shape our response. On Judy's point, it is vital to maintain agility. Building flexibility into our operational plans and establishing clear triggers will enable us to adapt efficiently while remaining compliant with state curriculum requirements. By doing so, we safeguard both academic quality and the well-being of everyone involved."

That level of collaboration will indeed ensure we're designing solutions that truly address the diverse needs within our community. Additionally, his suggestion of establishing \"Learning Hubs\" provides a promising short-term strategy for bridging the digital divide. Moving forward, let's continue to balance our desire for innovation with the need for equity and inclusivity, keeping in mind that our ultimate goal is to support the most vulnerable populations among our students."

  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thank you, Judy. You've aptly captured the essence of our collective efforts. Indeed, balancing innovation with equity and inclusivity is paramount. It's heartening to see us coalesce around the importance of community engagement and advisory boards. These collaborations will not only facilitate targeted support but also instill trust and confidence among the very stakeholders we aim to serve. Now, Graham, given your expertise in data analysis, how might we best integrate COVID case rate tracking into our decision-making framework, ensuring a seamless connection between data and actions taken to protect our students, staff, and broader community?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Thanks, Dave. We must monitor daily hospitalization rates alongside community spread statistics. Tracking such data consistently allows more accurate assessments, guiding future reopening phases to keep everyone connected safely. This consistent focus enables us to respond more fluidly, using the established triggers system Judy proposed for operational scenario shifts while maintaining curriculum integrity. In tandem with the 'hybrid' model, could we further refine remote educational delivery by strategically distributing high-quality laptops coupled with online infrastructure and ongoing training in digital facilitation for educators across multiple grade levels? In response to Ellen's query, this targeted digital rollout helps minimize logistical hurdles during the current crisis. Finally, as Dr. Haas touched on earlier during her update to the School Board, our strategic communication to families and employees must continually convey empathy and reassurance alongside practical guidance, helping mitigate anxiety tied to any potential health threat posed to them or their loved ones. How can we work alongside our HR leadership to proactively provide psychological supports to educators should we experience increased workload demands caused by various reopening scenarios? Through proactive communication and dedicated employee wellness programs, we bolster morale amidst evolving operating arrangements.  Is there anything else you would like me to add, Dr. McLaughlin or Ms. Colson? There may be a couple of things just generally, too. In terms of a lot of the ideas expressed today, what I think I hear is that there is a commitment to all children in spite of any learning challenges and learning styles differences they bring to the table. That's not always easy but to take everything off of an IEP as a way of saying, All right, the entire IEP stays intact. That takes a level of sophistication in how you train people who do not really have any background in special education to ensure that they don't fall back on stereotypes. It would be great if you could comment on that a bit later in the discussion if you need to, but my main question is around virtual versus blended classrooms. Do you guys feel ready for that part yet? If I'm wrong again, because my memory is failing quickly, my sense was the last time you provided information you were trying to get up to speed with the technology side. What is the progress report today, because I don't want to assume that we are closer now to that in reality? But also, it seems like there are many people in the country working on that. Can that information and knowledge be shared in an efficient fashion rather than sort of doing independent research projects everywhere?\nunknownspeaker"
