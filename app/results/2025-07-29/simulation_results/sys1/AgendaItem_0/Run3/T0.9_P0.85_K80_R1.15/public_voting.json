    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.1: COVID Mask Policy - The board will discuss the district\u2019s COVID-19 health protocols, specifically whether students should be required to wear masks while in classrooms. This policy would apply during the regular school day, with exceptions for lunch and designated mask-break periods. The goal is to balance student safety with comfort and learning effectiveness.. Who would like to start?"

    "content": "Thank you Graham. To start, I think it is essential that we hear from our administrative team about what they have learned so far regarding COVID case rates and risk assessments before moving forward into discussing masking requirements within schools. So Dr. Callahan could you share some context as well as an update from your assessment. And following up after that Dr. Oslund, please provide additional information regarding risk assessments. What are those saying currently? In addition, how do these align with current local guidance?  Could each one of you clarify any metrics which would serve as key indicators leading us to either revise or maintain such policies going forward?. I believe if there is a chance we can move towards easing restrictions then I want to make sure we explore that thoroughly as well but not at all costs. We need to stay focused on keeping kids safe while providing them with optimal learning experiences. That is my primary concern here. Are there questions right now for administration around this matter. Kate? Ellen? Judy? David? Katrina? Dave? Are there other comments? Or even further concerns you might already have regarding our policy proposals today and any potential revisions? Thank you very much. Just for some clarification, did Dr. Acuff wish to add anything at this point. You were wishing to say something if I recall correctly weren't you, Kate? Thanks for clarifying your thoughts there too Ms. Osborne. Okay so let's get back to Dr. Osland. Would you mind answering that question or rephrasing in another manner maybe we'll find that helpful. It seems a great deal to digest I suppose. A few minutes ago, Dr. Alvarado was talking about the impact of COVID on Hispanic children. How many teachers went through the whole pandemic. Is that correct I wonder.? Yes, okay, thank you. But I'm also curious to know, if possible at least by tomorrow morning and just to answer this query for tonight, Dr. Callahan: could we look across all grades and race categories comparing in-school cases and outside of school cases of the last six weeks? If you've got this material ready, then fantastic; otherwise, it may help inform future discussions later. Do you feel comfortable making a reply at this time or perhaps it needs more investigation first? Does anyone else desire any different things from Dr. Callahan prior to her response? There appears to be no one needing anything more. Alright I see Kate had a question on this, though. Is there something Dr. Os"

    "content": "Dr. Oslund, I appreciate Jon's thorough introduction. Concerning the risk assessments, can you explain the factors influencing the level of transmission in our schools compared to the broader community? For instance, do we have data illustrating the efficacy of ventilation systems, contact tracing efforts, and vaccination percentages among staff and students in mitigating transmission rates within schools versus extramural settings? By better understanding these dynamics, we can develop more targeted mitigation strategies to keep our students safer while also addressing their educational needs effectively."

  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thank you, Katrina. I completely agree with Kate's request. Understanding the specific factors impacting transmission levels between school and non-school environments is crucial for informed decision-making. Additionally, having access to granular data about vaccine coverage, ventilation system performance, and contact tracing initiatives would significantly enhance our ability to create effective strategies to minimize risks without compromising learning outcomes. Dr. Oslund, if you could elaborate on these aspects, I'd greatly appreciate it.  Afterward, I plan to ask about exploring accommodations for students who face unique challenges due to mask-wearing mandates. Ensuring fairness and equal opportunities must remain at the heart of our considerations."

    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "I concur with the sentiments expressed thus far, particularly the emphasis on balancing student safety with comfort and learning effectiveness. I'd like to piggyback off David's comment regarding accommodations for students facing unique challenges. As we discuss the COVID mask policy, it's essential to consider the equity implications and ensure that our approach doesn't inadvertently disadvantage certain groups of students, such as those with disabilities or language barriers. Can we explore ways to address these disparities proactively, potentially incorporating input from special education experts and multilingual support staff?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Absolutely, Judy. Your point highlights the critical importance of inclusive policymaking. I fully endorse seeking expertise from special education professionals and multilingual support staff to guarantee that our COVID mask policy does not exacerbate existing inequities. Furthermore, considering the diverse needs of our student body will enable us to craft thoughtful exemptions and accommodations, ensuring every child has an equitable opportunity to thrive academically and socially. Dr. Callahan, would it be feasible to schedule a meeting with relevant stakeholders to gather insights and recommendations on implementing these measures?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thank you, colleagues. To build upon Judy and David's concerns, I think it would be beneficial to investigate instances where masks might hinder learning or participation for particular students, such as English language learners or those requiring facial cues for comprehension. Have we gathered anecdotal evidence or feedback from educators on these scenarios? Moreover, I recommend consulting with disability advocates and cultural sensitivity specialists to identify culturally responsive solutions for accommodating our most vulnerable students during this pandemic. Dr. Callahan, if feasible, could we prepare a list of proposed accommodations based on the collective input received? This resource would facilitate informed decisions when revisiting our COVID-19 policies."

  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "I appreciate the thoughtful discussion and concerns shared so far. To contribute, I'd like to emphasize the importance of triangulating multiple sources of data to inform our policy decisions. In addition to the data requested by Graham and others, I suggest we also examine the correlation between teacher vaccination rates, student vaccination rates, and in-school transmission rates. This information will provide valuable context for our risk assessment and mitigation strategies. Further, I endorse the calls for collaboration with special education experts, multilingual support staff, and disability advocates to ensure our policies prioritize equity and inclusivity. Let's work together to develop a comprehensive framework that addresses the diverse needs of our student population."

    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "All righty. So Kate posed a question related to some data. Are you able to supply that to Ms. Coulson, perhaps by tomorrow, Ms. Colson? And again, Ellen mentioned looking at a correlation between teacher vaccination rates, pupil inoculation rates, and in-school case loads. If you don't currently possess that, then by what date could you give us that information or tell us whether you are able to garner it or unable to come up with it. Or whatever your situation might be.  Thank you very much.\nunknownspeaker: All right, yes. What I understand what they're asking me for, Dr. Page,  You asked for two things. One is the distribution of cases among races over the past six weeks and whether they were in school or out of school. That I believe I could do pretty easily and quickly. So probably could deliver that even today. The other piece around the correlation analysis for various pieces is going to take a little bit longer because that involves analyzing the datasets and doing statistical modeling.  Perhaps a week for sure by Friday, but certainly, hopefully sooner than that depending how my team's work unfolds. OK.\nunknownspeaker: Okay. Thank you very much. Other questions?  No questions yet, Mr. Alcarez. Go ahead. Right after the board meets next Thursday, the second week following that Monday, on November 15th, which is a Tuesday, we would need a letter from parents. So please remember, for the parents to opt out on February 1st, January 14th, we would need letters submitted by December 17th. And finally, April 26th, we would need the third parent opt-out by March 25th. If we continue into '22-'23. These dates aren't established yet. We hope that helps people make plans now. Thank you.\nunknownspeaker: Thanks, Dave. The reason why I wanted to say what happens before the 11th is simply so that each year we decide what our health mitigation procedures are, including masking, quarantining, and isolation. We usually announce them just before Labor Day. And we have done this annually since the start of the virus and each summer, we want to evaluate the local conditions and make determinations for ourselves and seek approval from the school board on our updated rules. And we made changes between years. And I guess we will make additional adjustments moving forward should we determine that there is a need"

    "content": "Thank you all. While continuing to assess risk factors and potential policy exceptions, I urge us to keep front-of-mind the long-term effects of prolonged mask-wearing on our students' mental health and social development. By engaging with students directly through surveys and focus groups, we can gain invaluable insight into their experiences and adjust our approaches accordingly. How might we incorporate youth voices more deliberately throughout this decision-making process, respecting both their agency and vulnerability amidst this crisis? Would it be possible to invite representatives from student government organizations to share their perspectives at a future board meeting?"

    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I appreciate Jonno's suggestion about incorporating student voice into our decision-making process. I agree that understanding their lived experience wearing masks daily can help shape our policy refinements. Incorporating direct feedback mechanisms, like surveys or listening sessions, will allow us to address their unique challenges while acknowledging the agency they deserve. It would indeed be wonderful to have student representatives attend one of our meetings to offer their perspective, possibly via a panel discussion. Their engagement will enhance our ability to weigh the pros and cons effectively as we navigate any future modifications to our mask policy. Can we explore ways to facilitate their active involvement without placing undue burdens on already stretched resources? In terms of timelines, might we look at early spring as an ideal time for meaningful input?  And let me remind everyone, we're coming close to closing the hour tonight. Just thinking about wrapping up here soon. If someone wants to add something briefly within the topic area that we've been covering thus far today, that is fine. But we are getting toward the end of the hour. Anybody else wish to add anything under the topic areas we've covered so far? Otherwise, I propose adjourning tonight's session shortly,  hoping you find this acceptable. We may return later. After we complete some business items tonight in closed session. Thank you.  Final comments.  Please wrap up quick and get home safe."
