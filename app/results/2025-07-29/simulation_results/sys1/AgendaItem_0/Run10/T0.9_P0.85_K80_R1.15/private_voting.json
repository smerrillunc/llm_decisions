    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.1: COVID Mask Policy - The board will discuss the district\u2019s COVID-19 health protocols, specifically whether students should be required to wear masks while in classrooms. This policy would apply during the regular school day, with exceptions for lunch and designated mask-break periods. The goal is to balance student safety with comfort and learning effectiveness.. Who would like to start?"

    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "I can lead off. We've received a good deal of input from staff, parents, and community members since our last meeting, and it appears there are differing perspectives around how much masking actually helps prevent transmission within schools. It seems some see it as essential for keeping kids safe while others view it as not very effective or even an obstacle to learning. There was also concern about implementation equity across all buildings given differences between them and various limitations they face. I believe we need more clarification before making any changes so that if we go ahead and make it optional, then what exactly do you envision? What kind of guidance would teachers receive regarding distancing, capacity limits, handwashing, surface cleaning, air filtration systems in classrooms, etc.? Do we have any expert testimony today, particularly medical professionals who could give us insights into this decision? And perhaps most importantly, once we decide what we want, how are we going to support both sides of the debate without further polarizing each other and how might our decisions affect certain groups of students or families differently? How does that sound for a framework of discussion? I'd love your thoughts on where you think we should focus first. Thank you. Ellen, Kate, Katrina. Would you mind sharing some initial observations or questions you've heard from constituents or had yourself? Then let's open things up to Dr. Oberg and Ms. Cuff to provide whatever context they can offer. Thanks!"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Yeah. Jon, thanks for leading us through this framework for consideration. For me personally, one thing is I really appreciate the engagement process and seeking input because there's indeed no consensus out there. Just as we did with summer programming, there are a lot of varying opinions among stakeholders. And my thought was why don't we share just a little bit at least now before Dr. Oberg shares her data which is going to be critical here, but just a brief summary of constituent feedback based on those surveys. From what I've seen in emails and phone calls, generally speaking, people seem divided pretty closely down the middle. Some say we must keep the mask mandate intact for their childrens' protection whereas another half thinks we're doing harm to these students academically by having them masked. So again, similar concerns shared earlier such as kids needing socialization skills back, communication difficulties especially with ESL learners and hearing-impaired kids wearing masks, teacher difficulty policing them, or potential loss of instructional time when conflicts arise due to non-compliance. My only personal observation question for tonight has been if a local hospital says the numbers aren't bad right now, though not great either, maybe we should have metrics-driven triggers rather than dates. In the fall, they said cases were low enough to remove the mask requirement and suddenly the Omicron wave happened. With variants always possible, perhaps setting conditions for reinstatement or relaxation gives clarity for administrators dealing with parents calling daily asking 'what's the plan.' Once the board decides that, our superintendents task force may need to work closely on messaging around adjustments. So I'll stop here. Any thoughts you guys would care to add or suggestions? Then let's ask Dr. Oberg to weigh in on case counts in our zip codes currently and get an update on how our mitigation strategies worked overall.   (17 seconds)\n```ruby\n# system written response (58)\nkateacuff: So thank you, Jon and Katrina.  One piece of information that came through quite clear after last week's meeting was this whole concept of fear associated with kids not feeling comfortable coming forward with symptoms. One doctor said it succinctly yesterday in an email to me when he pointed out that lots of students simply won't tell teachers they tested positive out of fear of being ostracized, sent home, or told not to play sports or attend prom. That was a comment that stood out. Another parent pointed out to me that she works in healthcare."

    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thank you, Kate. Yes, that concern about students fearing consequences for reporting their illness resonates deeply. As superintendent, it's crucial we create an environment where students feel safe disclosing their health status. Before presenting our current case rates and risk assessment, I want to acknowledge the importance of empathy and understanding in our approach. Our schools must foster trust, encouraging students to prioritize their well-being and that of their peers. Now, moving forward, I'd like to share our current data..."

    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "To build upon David's point, fostering trust includes addressing concerns from all corners of our community, especially students who often feel left behind. In terms of implementing this policy, I suggest we explore ways to incorporate active listening sessions or town halls with student leaders, ensuring we're elevating their voices throughout this process. This way, we demonstrate a commitment to inclusive decision-making and promote a culture where students feel valued and supported. What are everyone's thoughts on incorporating these sessions?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "I agree that building trust is vital and that student involvement is essential. Incorporating active listening sessions or town halls with student leaders will help ensure diverse perspectives are considered. Additionally, it could facilitate better understanding of the complexities surrounding mask-wearing policies, ultimately promoting a sense of ownership and cooperation amongst students. How might we structure these sessions to guarantee representation from underrepresented groups and maximize their impact on our decision-making process?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Excellent points, Judy. Structuring the sessions to guarantee representation from historically marginalized communities is key. We could partner with student affinity groups and clubs to reach beyond traditional leadership positions, actively recruiting representatives from different grade levels, socioeconomic backgrounds, racial demographics, and ability statuses. By intentionally designing these sessions to center equity and amplify underheard voices, we stand a greater chance of capturing a comprehensive picture of student experiences and needs."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "I completely concur with the emphasis on trust-building, inclusivity, and student-centered decision-making. It's crucial that we engage with our students in a meaningful way, acknowledging their agency and perspectives. I propose we also consider inviting experts, such as school counselors and mental health professionals, to participate in these listening sessions. They can provide valuable insights into the emotional and psychological impacts of mask-wearing policies on our students. Furthermore, their presence can help facilitate open conversations and ensure that our decisions prioritize student wellbeing."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Ellen, that sounds very helpful. I think part of the challenge we face lies in navigating multiple narratives simultaneously while keeping sight of our guiding principles and priorities. Involving more expert voices can only enrich our discussion. With that, I believe it's time for Dr. Oberg to give us a snapshot of our current situation regarding case rates and risk assessments within our zip code areas. Dr. Oberg, please proceed."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Absolutely, Jon. Dr. Oberg, please do share your findings on our current case rates and risk assessments. Your expertise will undoubtedly inform our discussions and guide our decision-making process. Before you begin, I'd like to reiterate our collective commitment to prioritizing student well-being, particularly for our most vulnerable populations. Let's focus on data-driven decision-making while remaining sensitive to the diverse needs and perspectives within our community. Please, Dr. Oberg, enlighten us on our current situation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thanks, Superintendent Oberg, for providing an overview of our county and zip-code specific trends today. Going back to some comments made by David and Judy earlier, I'm concerned whether we've talked enough about exceptions and accommodations both before and during enforcement phases. For instance, considering students experiencing anxiety related to wearing masks, kids suffering from sensory issues, and children having other medical exemptions which make compliance challenging. Have there been any considerations towards alternatives, special arrangements, or even individual plans for those types of situations when looking at our overall strategy?  Does that include outreach from counselors and support staff proactively reaching out to students, families, and educators with known needs before rolling out a revised masking policy?  Lastly, what input did our school nurses offer since they interface directly with students, educators, and administration daily? Would love to hear their observations and recommendations going forward.  And then finally just because my mind keeps wandering back to those communication challenges we had early on with announcements for bus ridership, extracurricular activities, so I guess I'd be interested to know are we prepared for that messaging aspect too?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Katrina raises excellent questions about accommodating diverse needs, including those with anxiety, sensory sensitivities, or medical exemptions.  Informed by feedback from our school nurses, counselors, and special education teams, we plan to develop alternative strategies and individualized plans for affected students. This may involve working closely with parents, guardians, and educators to identify suitable solutions, leveraging available resources, and exploring adaptive technologies. To address communication challenges, we'll establish a dedicated task force responsible for crafting clear, concise messages across various platforms, ensuring accessibility and minimizing confusion. School administrators, department heads, and communications specialists will collaborate on this effort. We recognize the importance of proactive engagement and transparency throughout the implementation phase."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thank you, Superintendent Oberg, for outlining the measures being taken to accommodate students with diverse needs. I appreciate the emphasis on collaboration between stakeholders and the consideration of adaptive technologies. However, I would like to press further on the specifics of these alternative strategies and individualized plans. Could we discuss potential examples of these adaptations, such as modified masks or PPE options for students with sensory sensitivities? Additionally, how will we ensure that these accommodations don't inadvertently stigmatize or isolate students who require them?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Judy, excellent follow-up questions! Our team has explored alternative mask designs and materials that cater to students' unique requirements. These may include masks with softer fabrics, adjustable straps, or specialized filters for respiratory concerns. Moreover, we're investigating the use of transparent masks to aid lip reading for students relying heavily on visual cues. As for stigma mitigation, we'll emphasize education and awareness campaigns highlighting the value of inclusion and diversity. By normalizing these accommodations and emphasizing empathy, we aim to create an environment where all students feel comfortable requesting necessary supports without fear of judgment. Further, we'll work closely with teachers to integrate these adaptations seamlessly into classroom routines, encouraging peer-to-peer understanding and acceptance."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thank you, Superintendent Oberg, for sharing those thoughtful approaches. Normalizing accommodations through education and awareness is crucial in fostering an inclusive culture. I'd like to build upon this idea by suggesting we involve students themselves in developing these campaigns, perhaps through partnerships with student advocacy groups or disability-focused clubs. By amplifying student voices and empowering them to drive this narrative, we can ensure authenticity and relevance, ultimately promoting a deeper sense of belonging among all students."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "I couldn't agree more, Judy. Empowering student advocates to lead these efforts not only promotes authenticity but also fosters leadership development, self-advocacy, and a stronger sense of ownership among our students. By doing so, we'll create a ripple effect, spreading awareness and compassion throughout our schools. I wholeheartedly endorse involving student advocacy groups and clubs in campaign design, message crafting, and promotional strategies. Their invaluable insights will help tailor our approach to resonate with their peers, breaking down barriers and cultivating a culture of empathy and understanding."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Building on Judy's suggestion, let's consider expanding this concept beyond the accommodation campaigns. How might we engage student representatives in shaping broader aspects of our revised masking policy, such as informing the rollout process, identifying potential pitfalls, and contributing to messaging around mask-wearing expectations? Students have firsthand experience with the day-to-day realities of wearing masks; harnessing their voices could yield valuable insights and improve policy effectiveness. What structures or channels exist currently to facilitate meaningful student participation in policy co-design and refinement?  Furthermore, can we explore ways to incorporate anonymous student feedback mechanisms to encourage candid responses and safeguard against potential biases in student representation?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Kate, your suggestion to engage students in shaping the revised masking policy is excellent. I completely agree that incorporating their voices will provide critical insight into the practicalities of implementing this policy. We already have existing structures in place, such as student council and advisory boards, that can serve as vehicles for student participation. Additionally, we can establish ad-hoc committees comprising students, teachers, and administrators to ensure diverse perspectives are represented. Regarding anonymous feedback mechanisms, we can utilize digital tools like surveys or online forums to collect candid responses, ensuring confidentiality and minimizing bias. By engaging students in this manner, we can foster a sense of ownership and responsibility, leading to a more effective and student-centered policy."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Ellen, thank you for outlining the existing structures and proposed mechanisms to facilitate student involvement. That sounds like a great starting point. To take it a step further, how do we ensure equitable representation within these committees and advisory boards, considering factors such as grade level, socioeconomic status, race, ability, and other demographic characteristics that influence experiences with mask-wearing? Can we designate seats specifically for underrepresented groups or implement intentional recruitment strategies to guarantee diverse perspectives are heard?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Absolutely, Kate. Ensuring equitable representation is crucial to avoid unintentionally marginalizing certain student populations. We can achieve this by intentionally designing our committees and advisory boards to reflect the demographics of our student body. For instance, we can reserve seats for representatives from underrepresented groups, conduct targeted outreach to recruit students from diverse backgrounds, and provide training on cultural responsiveness and implicit bias for committee members. Additionally, we can leverage data from our equity audits to inform our recruitment strategies and monitor progress towards achieving representative committees. By taking a deliberate and data-driven approach, we can create spaces where every student voice has an equal opportunity to be heard and valued."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Excellent suggestions, Ellen. Your emphasis on intentionality and data-driven decision-making resonates deeply. To supplement these efforts, what about providing additional support systems for students who may struggle to navigate the complexities of advocating for themselves or communicating their specific needs within these committees? Perhaps we could offer mentorship opportunities with trained advocates or peer supporters who understand the nuances of navigating accommodations and policy discussions. This added layer of scaffolding could empower students to participate confidently and effectively in shaping our policies. Would there be possibilities for collaborating with local organizations specializing in disability advocacy or youth empowerment to amplify our capacity for support?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Kate, that's a fantastic idea! Providing additional support systems for students who need extra guidance or confidence-building measures is essential for true inclusivity. Offering mentorship opportunities with trained advocates or peer supporters would not only empower students to advocate for themselves but also develop their leadership skills. Collaborating with local organizations specializing in disability advocacy or youth empowerment would indeed amplify our capacity for support and bring in expertise we might not possess internally. I envision partnering with these organizations to provide training for our staff and mentors, as well as connecting students with external resources and networks that can sustain them beyond their time in our schools. By doing so, we can ensure that every student feels equipped to contribute meaningfully to our policymaking processes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Exactly, Ellen. These collaborations would allow us to tap into the collective wisdom of experts while creating sustainable support systems that benefit both our students and the wider community. Another consideration: how can we ensure that the language used in policy documents, public communications, and educational materials is accessible, clear, and free of ableist or stigmatizing terminology? Should we convene a task force consisting of students, educators, and accessibility specialists to review our language practices and recommend improvements? This attention to linguistic detail can significantly impact how students perceive themselves and feel included within our school communities."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Kate, you're hitting all the right notes! Yes, absolutely, we must prioritize accessible language in all our communication channels. Convening a task force comprised of students, educators, and accessibility specialists is an excellent way to tackle this issue. By doing so, we can identify and eliminate ableist or stigmatizing language that may inadvertently perpetuate harm or exclusion. This task force can also develop guidelines and resources to support our staff in using respectful, person-centered language that promotes dignity and inclusion. Moreover, this effort can extend beyond policy documents to encompass everyday interactions, fostering a culture of respect and empathy that benefits everyone in our school community."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Precisely, Ellen. Inclusive language is just one facet of cultivating an environment that values and respects diversity in all its forms. As we move forward with revising our masking policy and implementation strategy, let's also consider conducting regular pulse checks with students, families, and staff to gauge the efficacy of our approaches and identify areas for continuous improvement. This commitment to ongoing assessment and adaptation will help us stay attuned to emerging concerns, address unintended consequences, and make adjustments that promote greater equity and wellbeing for all. How can we best structure these pulse checks to maximize participation, representativeness, and actionable insights?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Thank you, Kate. Regular pulse checks are essential for gauging our progress toward equity and refining our strategies. I suggest establishing quarterly surveys for students, families, and staff to gather broad input and maintain open communication lines. Additionally, let's schedule focus group sessions and town halls at least biannually to delve deeper into key issues and foster direct dialogue among stakeholders. Furthermore, setting up a dashboard to track relevant metrics, such as incident reports, exemption requests, and student performance, will enable us to analyze trends, respond promptly to challenges, and adapt our policies accordingly. We should also involve students in developing questions and analyzing survey results to instill a sense of agency and familiarity with the process. By triangulating these methods, we'll generate comprehensive insights that guide our decision-making and drive positive change. Does anyone have thoughts on how to integrate these assessments into our ongoing monitoring and evaluation framework?"
