    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.1: COVID Mask Policy - The board will discuss the district\u2019s COVID-19 health protocols, specifically whether students should be required to wear masks while in classrooms. This policy would apply during the regular school day, with exceptions for lunch and designated mask-break periods. The goal is to balance student safety with comfort and learning effectiveness.. Who would like to start?"

    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "I'll begin by stating that our primary concern has been balancing safety and effective instruction. For some time now, we have been looking at the number of active cases per hundred thousand. On Monday, our rate was at 52 active cases per hundred thousand. As you know, masks significantly reduce transmission of airborne droplets and aerosols in schools. We need a solution here, not only to protect students but also teachers, their families, and other support personnel as well. If we don't require masks inside schools during the instructional day, I do worry about the potential negative impact it could have on in-person education continuing throughout the school year. I want to acknowledge Judy's team worked tirelessly implementing various safety measures. That said, it is still worth considering having one more added layer of protection, which can provide an added sense of security for everyone within our buildings while cases are high in the community. What else can Judy add to the context around what we did to establish those mitigation strategies up until now? And maybe Katrina, if she had any comments from the county side of things? Then Davido mentioned sending something about how they handled it elsewhere. So it may all be very informative for everybody and help us make better-informed decisions. Is that okay to proceed? We started the school year with multiple layers of mitigation in place: temperature scanning upon entry, distancing whenever possible, increased ventilation improvements, hand washing stations, sanitizing and disinfecting routines,  etc. When we were able to shift down our case count within our community and see consistent downward trends, we adjusted certain policies, allowing them to fade away.  Now with rising rates of positive tests in Warren County, we know in order to ensure student safety, to maintain healthy school environments, and keep delivering essential learning experiences for every kid to the best of our abilities, it's important to look again at how these mitigation methods interact and collaborate to achieve our goal. I believe Dr. Callsen shared information regarding other districts. So now might be a good time for that. In addition, Mr. Oberg expressed there was information he got from somewhere else in terms of how that was actually working there and its possible effects.  Could Dr. Callsen speak to anything related that they learned with respect to the work going on outside here in our district? And if so, maybe even any results? And Mr. Oberg, if you wouldn't mind passing around your file share or whatever, that seems pretty interesting. Thanks. And"

    "content": "Sure, I'd be happy to go first. Thanks, Judy, for setting up everything so effectively. You mentioned my comments concerning mask-wearing mandates in neighboring counties and divisions. At least one system we contacted, Frederick County Public Schools recently moved to an optional mask scenario in mid-January, but then re-imposed requirements just six days later due to surging infection rates. A nearby school division kept masking despite a county mask ban because the superintendent wanted to continue mitigating transmission risk. These experiences reinforce that mask wearing has a role in curbing viral spread, certainly when applied in concert with other precautions and protocols you listed earlier. It also shows why continuous analysis of local data and trend lines becomes incredibly important to inform decision-making processes. Do others want to weigh in before proceeding further? Thank you."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Yes, thank you, Katrina, for sharing those examples. I appreciate Judy's overview of our current situation and the efforts put into establishing those mitigation strategies. The context really helps frame our discussion today. I did send over some material on how Oakland Unified School District in California tackled mask policies. They successfully implemented a mask requirement early on, and saw significant decreases in cases among students and staff. Their experience highlights the importance of consistency across the entire district, along with clear communication and education on proper mask use. Would love to hear others' thoughts on how these external examples might influence our own approach moving forward. Kate or Ellen, do you have any insights on student perspectives or concerns that could inform our decision-making process?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thank you, David, for sharing the Oakland Unified School District's experience. It's valuable to consider the successes of other districts in informing our approach. As we move forward, I think it's crucial to emphasize not only the benefits of mask-wearing but also address any concerns or challenges that may arise, particularly among our students. Before we explore enforcement strategies, I'd like to touch on the issue of exceptions and accommodations. How might we ensure equity and inclusivity for students who may face difficulties wearing masks due to medical conditions or other reasons? Are there any suggestions on how we can create a framework for such exceptions while maintaining the overall safety of our school environment? Ellen, Kate, your input on this aspect would be greatly appreciated."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I'd like to start by acknowledging Judy's emphasis on ensuring equity and inclusivity in exception policies. To ensure fairness, we need to create a framework that provides alternatives for students unable to wear masks.  One possible consideration could be offering virtual learning options or alternative PPE for students with special needs. We should consult medical professionals to identify reasonable accommodations that minimize risks for both these students and the general student body. Furthermore, transparency and clear communication about exception policies will be critical for avoiding misunderstandings and promoting cooperation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "I wholeheartedly agree with Kate's suggestions. Creating a fair and inclusive framework for exceptions is vital. Consulting medical professionals and involving stakeholders in the decision-making process will help ensure that we're meeting the diverse needs of our students. Transparency and clear communication are key to building trust and understanding among students, parents, and staff. Let's prioritize collaboration to develop a comprehensive plan that balances individual needs with the collective goal of maintaining a safe and healthy learning environment. Jonno, would you like to share any insights on how we can effectively communicate these policies to our students and the broader community?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Thank you, Ellen. That ties well into a crucial component I wanted to stress - effective communication with both internal and external stakeholders. Communication has been essential thus far. That doesn't mean improvement isn't an option. As we decide whether adjustments to mitigation strategies happen and potentially adopt new practices like requiring masks once more, messaging becomes evermore vital. This includes students themselves being involved. One strategy might involve student ambassadors supporting peer-to-peer educational efforts while we engage other stakeholder groups through town halls, advisory meetings, surveys, parent-teacher associations (PTA) sessions, as well as continued electronic notification updates. Moreover, we could leverage digital platforms, including our website, social media channels, and email newsletters for easy access to updated resources, guidelines, and key dates. With this multifaceted approach, we promote informed decision-making and support. What do Graham Page, Davido, or Judy think? Shouldn't we incorporate all voices in these communication efforts? Thanks."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I concur that open communication is imperative, especially in creating awareness of potential policy changes affecting mask-wearing and the procedures encompassing exceptions and accommodation. Effective exchange of information is paramount to securing the necessary buy-in from every stakeholder group within our school community. It is very much so essential that as we craft plans to facilitate successful rollouts of adjusted protocols or any future amendments, they integrate a comprehensive and thoughtful information-sharing strategy that includes teachers, staff members, parents, guardians, and lastly, but importantly, the students themselves who remain heavily invested in this learning journey, together with their own academic and non-academic pursuits alike."

  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Excellent points, everyone. I wholeheartedly endorse the idea of multifaceted communication strategies and incorporating diverse voices throughout our school community. It's indeed crucial for ensuring a smooth implementation of any new policies or adjustments. Incorporating student ambassadors and empowering them to take leadership roles in peer-to-peer education and awareness-building resonates deeply with me. Also, considering the perspectives of teachers, staff, parents, and guardians will yield invaluable feedback that can refine our approach to creating equitable exceptions and accommodations.  Judy, given the significance of stakeholder engagement, perhaps we can discuss ways to establish an ad-hoc committee comprised of representatives from these various groups to provide ongoing input during the development and review of our COVID-19 response measures?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "I completely agree with the emphasis on inclusive communication and stakeholder engagement. David, your suggestion of an ad-hoc committee comprising representatives from diverse groups is an excellent idea. This collaborative approach would not only ensure that we're capturing a wide range of perspectives but also foster a sense of ownership and accountability among stakeholders. By doing so, we can develop a more effective and responsive COVID-19 response that addresses the unique needs and concerns of our school community. To build upon this idea, we could establish a clear structure and schedule for regular meetings, allowing the committee to provide ongoing input and feedback throughout the implementation process. Additionally, we might consider designating specific liaison roles within the committee to facilitate seamless communication between subgroups and the administration. Ellen, what are your thoughts on how we can ensure the ad-hoc committee remains focused on its objectives while still allowing for flexibility and adaptability in response to emerging issues or concerns?"

By doing so, we can maintain accountability, trust, and a commitment to equity and inclusivity throughout the decision-making process. Kate, what are your thoughts on how we can leverage existing communication channels to amplify the committee's work and keep the broader community informed?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thanks, Ellen. Building on your suggestions, we could repurpose our current monthly town hall format to include updates from the ad-hoc committee, as well as dedicate specific sections of our website and social media channels to committee news and resources. This way, we can create a one-stop-shop for community members to stay informed about the committee's work and provide feedback. We should also consider establishing an anonymous feedback system, such as a survey platform or comment box, to ensure that all voices are heard and valued. Davido, would you agree that by centralizing communication and leveraging technology, we can increase accessibility, transparency, and overall effectiveness of the committee's efforts?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Absolutely, Kate! Centralizing communication and utilizing technology effectively are crucial steps toward promoting accessibility and transparency. I appreciate your suggestion for dedicating sections of our website and social media channels to committee news and resources.  An anonymous feedback system is also a great idea; it can empower quieter voices and those who may feel hesitant to share their opinions otherwise. By embracing a multi-channel approach, we'll be able to cater to different preferences and needs within our school community. Going forward, I believe our ad-hoc committee can play a pivotal role in nurturing a culture of open dialogue and collaboration. Jonno, your insights on implementing effective mask mandates have been enlightening. How do you envision the committee's role in informing and supporting schools' decisions related to masking requirements and possible exceptions for students and staff members?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "That's an incredible question, Davido. I propose that the ad-hoc committee serves as a primary source of evidence-based guidance for administrative decisions around masking policies and their implications. Committee members can analyze trends, consult with experts, and engage with diverse stakeholders to offer nuanced recommendations. By staying attuned to the evolving pandemic landscape and local health metrics, they can advise on potential adjustments to masking requirements and criteria for exemptions, ensuring that we prioritize both community safety and individual needs. Their work would ultimately inform and enhance our district's continued response to COVID-19. Katrina, how can we utilize available data sources like local case rates and hospitalization statistics to assess our masking protocols' efficacy and respond accordingly?"

  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Thank you, Katrina. Ensuring sound research practices is absolutely pivotal. In my mind, three critical elements must be considered. The first of those is creating clearly defined parameters around measuring the emotional and mental impact of mask-wearing policies along with a method to capture the lived experiences of students who face added burden due to systemic inequities or disability. Secondly, establishing transparent benchmarks for evaluating the effectiveness of masking requirements across different environments within schools - such as classrooms, hallways, cafeterias, and playgrounds - could aid us in better grasping what does and does not yield positive outcomes. Thirdly, we have an obligation to standardize tools assessing the perceived benefits and drawbacks associated with the mask-wearing mandate using a lens of intersectionality that centers those oft-marginalized, ensuring our analysis honors those who matter most in these decisions. To achieve these research aims collaboratively, we should consider cross-functional task forces consisting of instructional leaders, mental health professionals, educational researchers, and family community engagement specialists. This kind of multidisciplinary design thinking has promise in helping us answer the many pressing questions surrounding school reopenings during this unprecedented public health crisis, while staying steadfast in our pursuit of justice-oriented pandemic preparedness. Kate, do you envision how these cross-functional teams could contribute valuable insights into designing the qualitative and quantitative assessments called for above, with an eye towards our mission of centering student voice and lived experiences in the policymaking arena?"
