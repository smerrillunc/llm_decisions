    "comment": "Motion fails due to lack of second after roll call with all four Board Members voting \"Abstain\". There was not any motion made by anyone else so there wasn't anything to discuss really other than what we had already discussed at previous meetings about this topic anyway but since nobody wanted to make another motion then nothing could happen tonight because none were forthcoming from anybody including me who would've liked something different if someone proposed it which they didn't do though. So now onto Special Reports Announcements and Recognitions unless somebody has some sort of emergency item needing immediate action requiring us going into closed session first like last month when Mr. Page needed his job description changed officially again even more months later still without having found him yet either qualified candidate finally hired full-time anywhere close enough nearby where he lives too far away currently working remotely mostly out of Virginia Beach area instead near Richmond lately doing both jobs simultaneously while waiting longer until next spring semester starts up hopefully soon bringing stability back once again locally here around Williamsburg Area County Schools districtwide system administration offices downtown main building off Mounts Bay Road across from James Blair Middle School campus grounds athletic fields parking lot behind WJCC Public Library plus Sentara Hospital complex down Longhill Road past Montessori private elementary charter school entrance opposite side street corner traffic light intersection stoplight signalized crossing walkway pedestrian crosswalk bike lanes road stripings pavement markings line painting repaving resurfacing projects scheduled summer break maintenance repairs construction updates facility improvements capital improvement plans CIP FY23 annual operating budgets fiscal year financial planning strategic plan goals objectives priorities timelines deadlines key performance indicators metrics targets outcomes assessments evaluations feedback surveys public input town hall forums focus groups parent teacher organization PTO membership recruitment volunteers fundraising events spirit nights restaurant sponsorships silent auctions charity runs walks fun-runs homecoming dances prom court queen king royalty nominees candidates election process speeches posters flyers banners signs decorations themes colors balloons streamers tablecloths centerpieces music playlists DJs photo booths props accessories tickets sales box office receipts revenue projections income statements expense reports profit loss ledgers balance sheets cash flow forecasts investments returns yields interest rates bonds loans grants donations philanthropy corporate partnerships foundations non-profit organizations tax exempt status Internal Revenue Service IRS Section 501c3 compliance audits reviews findings recommendations corrective actions responses follow-up visits monitoring oversight internal controls risk management enterprise risk ERM committee charters policies procedures manuals handbooks guidelines standards codes laws regulations rules ordinances zoning land use permits inspections certificates occupancy licenses fees fines penalties citations warnings notices violations enforcement mitigation settlements agreements contracts memoranda MOUs interagency collaboration regional cooper"
