Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.1: COVID Mask Policy - The board will discuss the district\u2019s COVID-19 health protocols, specifically whether students should be required to wear masks while in classrooms. This policy would apply during the regular school day, with exceptions for lunch and designated mask-break periods. The goal is to balance student safety with comfort and learning effectiveness.. Who would like to start?"

    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "To follow up on Mr. Alcaro's comment, I have reached out to the county manager for an update because she said at one point they were going to send over data more regularly so I can share with you if needed. But based on last week's update from Dr. Parker at the Board of Supervisors meeting, Albemarle County was downgraded by VDH (Virginia Department of Health) into the low transmission category, which puts it alongside only three other localities statewide. Our cases per 100,000 residents continue to go down over time but still higher than Charlottesville City. So that is good news overall, moving towards better. However, also note that UVA Hospital admissions remain high."

    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "I appreciate Katrina bringing that context to our discussion today. It sounds like there has been progress made in terms of reducing transmission rates locally. As we consider requiring masks in schools, I want to emphasize the importance of balancing risk mitigation strategies with ensuring that our educational environment supports both academic achievement and the emotional wellbeing of our students. Can Dr. Osgood provide any insight into how effective mask-wearing has proven to be in similar settings, such as schools in neighboring districts or peer institutions elsewhere in Virginia?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thank you, David, for highlighting the need to balance risk reduction with supporting student wellbeing. In response to your question, research suggests that universal masking in schools can significantly reduce COVID-19 transmission rates when implemented consistently and correctly. A study published in Pediatrics found that schools with mask mandates had a 72% lower incidence rate compared to those without. Additionally, the CDC recommends universal indoor masking for all students, teachers, and staff in K-12 settings, regardless of vaccination status, to minimize disruptions to in-person education. These findings can inform our consideration of implementing a mask mandate in our own schools."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Judy, thank you for providing that crucial evidence-based perspective. Those statistics are compelling, particularly considering the potential impact on minimizing disruptions to in-person learning. Before we move forward, I'd like to explore further the implications of a mask mandate on student wellbeing, particularly for our most vulnerable populations \u2013 students with disabilities, English language learners, and those experiencing trauma or anxiety. How might we ensure accommodations and support systems are in place to address their unique needs within a masked-learning environment?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Excellent question, David. Indeed, we must prioritize equity and inclusivity in our considerations. Research suggests that some students may experience challenges related to wearing masks, including communication barriers for deaf or hard-of-hearing students who rely on lip-reading or facial cues. We'll need to develop targeted accommodations, such as clear masks, visual aids, or alternative communication methods. For students with sensory sensitivities or anxiety, we can offer flexible mask options or designated breaks. By collaborating with our special education team, counselors, and community partners, we can create a comprehensive plan to support these students' diverse needs and ensure equal access to education."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "I'm grateful for your thoughtful approach, Judy. Ensuring inclusive practices will indeed be critical in implementing a successful mask mandate. Speaking of collaboration, I believe it's equally important to engage with our teaching staff, many of whom have been instrumental in adapting to our evolving pandemic response. What input have we gathered from them thus far regarding the practicality and feasibility of enforcing mask-wearing in classrooms, and how can we continue to solicit their feedback throughout this process? Kate, perhaps you've heard concerns or suggestions from our educators that can inform our discussion?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "David, I appreciate your emphasis on engaging with our dedicated teaching staff. I've spoken with several teachers who expressed mixed feelings about mandating masks. While many recognize its value in preventing transmission, others worry about enforcement logistics and potential distractions in the classroom. Some suggested incorporating mask-wearing into lesson plans to promote compliance and understanding among students. Teachers also emphasized the importance of maintaining clear communication channels between themselves, administrators, and parents regarding mask policies and implementation. Going forward, I recommend establishing a teacher-led advisory committee to provide ongoing guidance on best practices, share innovative approaches, and identify potential obstacles to success."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "I completely agree with Kate's suggestion to establish a teacher-led advisory committee. It's crucial to empower our educators to take ownership of this initiative and provide valuable insights into the realities of implementing a mask mandate in their daily practice. Additionally, I propose we schedule focus groups with students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, to gather their perspectives on mask-wearing and its impact on their learning experiences. By listening to their voices, we can better tailor our approach to meet their needs and ensure a more equitable outcome."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Ellen, I couldn't agree more. Incorporating student voices, especially from historically marginalized communities, is essential to creating an informed policy that addresses their specific concerns and promotes a positive school climate. These focus groups could be facilitated by our school counselors or diversity, equity, and inclusion specialists to ensure safe spaces for honest dialogue. The feedback collected will not only enhance our mask mandate implementation but also contribute to broader efforts aimed at fostering greater empathy, respect, and understanding within our school communities."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Absolutely, Kate! That's a great idea. And let's also consider involving our school nurses and health services teams in the planning process, given their expertise in infection control and student health. They can help us develop protocols for addressing exemptions, accommodations, and mask-related issues that may arise during implementation. This multidisciplinary approach will enable us to craft a comprehensive strategy that balances public health measures with the social-emotional and academic needs of our students."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Exactly, Ellen. Our school nurses and health services teams bring invaluable knowledge and experience to the table. Their involvement will ensure that our protocols are grounded in medical expertise and aligned with local health department guidelines. Moreover, having a clear process in place for handling exemptions, accommodations, and mask-related issues will help alleviate concerns among families and staff while promoting consistency across our schools. By working together, we can create a robust plan that prioritizes student safety, well-being, and academic success."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Well said, Kate. Consistency and clarity are key to effective implementation. I think we're making great progress here. Let's summarize the main points so far: we've discussed the importance of balancing risk reduction with student wellbeing, considered the effectiveness of mask-wearing in reducing transmission rates, and identified the need for inclusive accommodations and supports. We've also highlighted the value of stakeholder engagement, including teachers, students, and school nurses, in shaping our approach. Shall we move on to discussing strategies for implementation and enforcement, including communication plans, monitoring, and addressing non-compliance? Graham, would you like to lead this part of the discussion?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Thank you, Ellen. Yes, it is time to talk about how we implement and enforce a mask-wearing requirement. But before doing that, I just want to say that there has been one common thread through every single person speaking today, whether they were pro-mask or anti-mask, that thread was caring deeply about the welfare and health of children. I know we have different opinions. But what unites us is love for kids, wanting to keep them healthy and wanting to make sure that they receive a high-quality education. So, no matter where people come down on masking requirements, please remember that each of you cares deeply about the welfare of young people. As we discuss how we actually put this thing into effect, we should be guided by that spirit of care and compassion. And if we stay centered around that, then we can figure out the details. So, yes, let's go ahead and discuss how we communicate with folks about this new policy, how we monitor its effectiveness, and how we respond when someone doesn't comply with it.  All right, does anyone else have any thoughts about this particular issue? Would you like to start, Katrina? Or do you have any other comments on this aspect of things? Do you want me to go first and then everyone follow up after that, or would you rather start us off? Go ahead, Katrina. I guess maybe I should stop talking now too because everybody knows my opinion anyway, so feel free to chime in anytime. I don't mean to hog the floor. You guys got it started, so I'll shut up finally. Maybe it won't happen often, but I promise that will happen sometimes. Please give us some ideas of how we would handle this situation since that didn't work very well. If you had an individual kid showing up without a face shield and you didn't allow them to enter class, you could still use Zoom and have them attend classes virtually until that issue gets resolved. Then I really like that comment about using virtual attendance or even calling parents directly, which might cause some conflict but at least it forces the issue. You know, I guess one thing that occurred to me and what I was hoping some of the principals would tell me was how much authority did they have over something like this. Could a principal decide whether he wanted to require masks in his school building? Can he do that independent of the board action? Are there some schools where the administration says we just don't want to mess with"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thanks, Graham. Just to clarify regarding your question, current policy gives our principals flexibility to implement certain practices based on site-specific considerations, such as COVID mitigation strategies. However, given the system-wide implications of a mask mandate, I believe it would be important to establish a consistent district-wide policy governing its implementation, exceptions, and accommodations. In terms of communication strategies, I suggest we leverage various channels to reach all stakeholders, including email updates, social media posts, parent-teacher conferences, and student assemblies. It's crucial we provide clear guidance on expectations, procedures, and resources available to support compliance. For instance, we could distribute visual reminders in classrooms and common areas, offer educational materials on proper mask usage, and maintain an FAQ webpage addressing frequently asked questions. What are others' thoughts on how best to disseminate information and encourage cooperation? How might we address potential pushback or resistance from some members of our community?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Great suggestions, Katrina. I think we must acknowledge upfront that there may be differing levels of acceptance within our communities, so we should anticipate some initial pushback. One way to mitigate this could be by engaging student ambassadors who can serve as peer-to-peer advocates for mask-wearing and reinforce positive messaging. Additionally, involving local healthcare professionals in our outreach efforts may lend credibility to our initiatives and reassure those with concerns. Ultimately, transparent communication, empathy, and active listening will be essential in fostering trust and collaboration throughout this process. Kate, your insight into the role of school nurses in addressing mask-related concerns resonated with me; how do you envision incorporating their input into these communication strategies?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Jon, I agree that involving school nurses is vital to successful implementation. They possess valuable expertise in infection control and can help develop targeted messaging tailored to specific school environments. Moreover, leveraging nurse leadership in staff training and parent-teacher conferences can build confidence among both educators and families. To ensure comprehensive support, I propose establishing a dedicated task force comprising representatives from nursing services, teacher organizations, and central office administrators. This team can facilitate regular check-ins, share best practices, and troubleshoot issues arising during rollout. By integrating diverse perspectives and expertise, we can better navigate potential hurdles while maintaining focus on our shared goal: promoting a safe learning environment that benefits every student."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "That sounds like an excellent approach, Kate. Having a cross-functional task force would not only streamline decision-making but also enable more effective problem-solving. We should prioritize identifying key performance indicators (KPIs) for measuring success in implementing the mask mandate, tracking progress toward meeting established goals, and making adjustments accordingly. Judy, I'd appreciate your thoughts on developing KPIs aligned with existing metrics and ensuring their seamless integration into our evaluation processes. Furthermore, considering our commitment to equity, it's crucial that our assessment methods capture the experiences of students most disproportionately affected by the pandemic, such as English-language learners and special needs populations. Can you speak to ways we can tailor our measures to account for these critical nuances?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thank you, Jon. I couldn't agree more about the importance of inclusive metrics. Judy, I'm interested in hearing your ideas for KPIs and how we can adapt them to suit our unique demographics and priorities. Before you dive into that, though, I just want to quickly touch upon Kate's suggestion of having school nurses participate in training sessions. Given time constraints, perhaps we could consider pre-recorded modules led by our nursing staff that teachers can access asynchronously. These modules could cover topics ranging from mask-fitting tutorials to scenarios handling mask non-compliance. Such training tools can empower our educators to effectively manage situations while ensuring consistency across sites. Now, Judy, please proceed with your insights on KPI development and tailoring assessments to meet the distinct needs of vulnerable student groups."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "I think it's wonderful that everyone is offering innovative solutions here. With regards to Judy's thoughts on developing KPIs, I completely agree that focusing on metrics that truly reflect the impact of the mask mandate on students, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, is absolutely essential. Perhaps we can explore collaborating with external research partners to create more nuanced metrics that gauge not only the effectiveness of mask mandates but also their influence on overall wellbeing, academic achievement, and socio-emotional development. This could lead to more informed decisions grounded in empirical evidence rather than speculation. In addition, through surveys, town halls, and other forms of engagement, we need to continue soliciting feedback from families and students themselves, empowering their voices in shaping policies that affect them directly. Any thoughts on how to strike a balance between data-driven decision-making and genuinely listening to our constituents?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "David, I appreciate your emphasis on balancing data-informed decisions with stakeholder input. To achieve this balance, we can establish a participatory evaluation framework that engages diverse community members, including parents, students, and educators, in co-designing KPIs and providing ongoing feedback. This collaborative approach ensures our metrics remain relevant, responsive, and culturally sensitive. As we develop KPIs, let's prioritize indicators that measure not only COVID transmission rates and mask adherence but also student wellbeing, attendance, and academic outcomes. By doing so, we'll gain a more comprehensive understanding of the mask mandate's effects and make adjustments that benefit our entire school community."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Judy, your concept of a participatory evaluation framework is music to my ears! Engaging diverse stakeholders in KPI design and feedback loops will undoubtedly yield a richer, more accurate picture of the mask mandate's impact. I wholeheartedly endorse prioritizing indicators that encompass student wellbeing, attendance, and academic outcomes alongside COVID transmission rates and mask adherence. By taking a holistic approach, we're acknowledging that our students' health extends beyond mere physical safety to include emotional and intellectual flourishing. Ellen, what are your thoughts on how we can integrate the findings from this participatory evaluation framework into our policy review cycles, ensuring continuous improvement and refinement of our response to emerging challenges?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, David. I'm thrilled to see us embracing a collaborative approach to evaluating the mask mandate's effectiveness. Integrating the findings from our participatory evaluation framework into policy review cycles will indeed drive continuous improvement. To achieve this, I suggest scheduling regular review meetings where task force representatives, stakeholders, and researchers come together to discuss key learnings, identify areas for adjustment, and inform future iterations of our mask-wearing policies. By embedding this reflective practice into our workflow, we'll stay attuned to evolving circumstances, respond proactively to emerging challenges, and ensure our mitigation strategies remain centered around the needs of all students. Graham, your earlier mention of student ambassadors sparked an idea \u2013 perhaps we could involve them in these review meetings as well, further amplifying student voices and perspectives in shaping our policies. What are your thoughts on this potential collaboration?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "I really do believe involving our students is important because they have been incredibly resilient throughout this pandemic and it has had quite an effect on their lives. They have seen things happen within schools and they've seen some successes and failures firsthand, and to be able to tap into that experience would certainly help improve any new iteration or changes that we might put out there to address the virus. And then if we go back to Dr. Alcarez's thought about, oh, how did he say, creating virtual clubs or something similar, getting them involved in this process through virtual clubs seems to me like one way to amplify that voice. So thank you very much, Ms. Osborne. I don't know who was next, but I guess I didn't answer anything else that came up yet anyway. I'll stop right now."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Absolutely, Graham, involving students in the policymaking process will provide invaluable insights and foster a sense of ownership among them. Virtual clubs or focus groups can be an excellent way to engage students remotely, especially during times when in-person interactions may be limited. Jonno, you mentioned earlier the importance of considering exceptions and accommodations; could you elaborate on how we might incorporate student feedback into developing guidelines for exemptions or modifications to the mask-wearing policy, ensuring we're addressing the diverse needs of our student population?"
