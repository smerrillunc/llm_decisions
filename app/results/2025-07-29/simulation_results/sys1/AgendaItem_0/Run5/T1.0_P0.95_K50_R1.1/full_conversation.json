Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.1: COVID Mask Policy - The board will discuss the district\u2019s COVID-19 health protocols, specifically whether students should be required to wear masks while in classrooms. This policy would apply during the regular school day, with exceptions for lunch and designated mask-break periods. The goal is to balance student safety with comfort and learning effectiveness.. Who would like to start?"

It seems to me we all benefit from context, what the situation looks like right now in our school system before weighing that against what research might tell us. Perhaps Dr. O'Sullivan has some insight from the Health Department for how prevalent these transmissions are here in school systems currently. How can that information guide us moving forward? That was going to be my primary point anyway, but then I believe Ms. Colsen had her hand up too. Ms. Coleman? Go ahead, please, Katrine Colson. And Dr. O'Sullivan? Could you give us an update about local transmission patterns within our schools since our meeting in July?."

    "content": "I don't know if David (David o'burg) will have anything in a moment, thank you all, Jon. We'll go back and forth. There were some numbers last week that were provided in the superintendent's email where we said there was still a low community level of spread. I think at that time last week we're talking about around ten or eleven hospitalizations per hundred thousand people in the general population. But today I've seen more cases, though thankfully no reported fatalities yet. Since returning to classes, I personally have received multiple notifications about teachers who have COVID. I am sure it's not unique to their families because their entire class remains quarantined, which is a concern. So when I was thinking about those questions before tonight, and I just went through your slides again, David (David Oburg), I couldn't help but wonder why there isn with an exemption process so far as I could find any place, either under emergency rules and regulations approved by state authorities. In New York, New Jersey, every other state where I looked, once they passed those new laws to extend them for whatever length of time until December, you have opt-out requirements and rules governing religious exemptions. You have provisions addressing vaccination mandates when appropriate; however, there seemed to be an overarching national trend. When we look at different states and see who needs to wear a mask to protect employees and the most vulnerable when unvaccinated students attend. It doesn't look to me as though we're following that model here. Thanks for letting me kick off today. If I made mistakes with facts you can correct me. Then Kate Acuff I had also signed up to speak, then Judylee.\n```"

    "content": "Thank you, Katrina. Just to add some clarity, yes, our current case rates do remain relatively low compared to earlier in the pandemic. However, as Katrina mentioned, we have seen a slight uptick recently. As per our district's risk assessment, I agree that it's crucial to consider the prevalence of COVID-19 transmission within our schools. Our data suggests that most cases are mild, but we must take proactive measures to safeguard our most vulnerable populations \u2013 students, staff, and faculty alike. With that said, let's discuss potential strategies for balancing comfort and learning effectiveness with our health protocols. Have others observed similar concerns regarding teacher quarantines and its impact on classroom continuity?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Building upon David's points, I'm concerned that even with lower case rates, we still have a responsibility to prioritize equity and inclusivity in our decision-making. Specifically, I'm thinking about students who may be more susceptible to severe illness due to underlying medical conditions or those living with family members who are immunocompromised. As we weigh the pros and cons of a mask mandate, let's ensure we're considering the needs of these students and exploring ways to mitigate potential risks. Can we discuss possible accommodations for these students, such as remote learning options or enhanced ventilation systems in classrooms?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thank you, Judy. I completely concur with your emphasis on equity and inclusivity considerations. Speaking as a parent of a child with a compromised immune system myself, I understand firsthand the importance of creating safe learning environments for our most vulnerable students. In discussing potential accommodations, I'd suggest we delve into the viability of both short-term solutions and longer-term infrastructure investments. For instance, have we explored partnering with local healthcare providers to establish rapid-testing sites for students exhibiting symptoms, allowing for swift identification and response? Additionally, what would be the feasibility of incorporating air-purification systems or improving ventilation within specific classrooms serving high-risk student populations? By prioritizing their well-being, we demonstrate a commitment to equity and inclusive education."

    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, Kate. Your personal experience and suggestions offer valuable insights. I'd like to build on your idea of partnering with local healthcare providers. Have we considered leveraging our existing relationships with school nurses and healthcare professionals to provide guidance on implementing effective testing and contact-tracing protocols? Additionally, what role can we envision for these partners in supporting teachers and staff in identifying and responding to COVID-19 cases in real-time?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Absolutely, Ellen. I think that's a great direction to explore. School nurses play a vital role in connecting our schools with the broader healthcare system. By working closely with them, we could develop targeted interventions and response plans tailored to the specific needs of each school community. Moreover, involving healthcare professionals in teacher training could empower educators to recognize early signs of COVID-19, facilitating prompt notification and action when needed. This partnership could ultimately enhance our capacity for swift and effective contact tracing, thereby mitigating transmission within our schools. Do we have data on the current scope of support school nurses are providing regarding COVID-related matters?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Great point, Kate. According to our data, school nurses are already shouldering a significant burden in terms of COVID-related responsibilities, including conducting contact tracing, providing guidance on quarantine procedures, and coordinating with local health departments. However, we do need to further examine how we can better leverage their expertise to inform our response strategies. Perhaps we could task our school nurses with conducting regular reviews of our COVID-19 protocols to ensure they remain aligned with evolving public health guidelines and best practices. What are your thoughts, David, on how we might formalize this process and ensure our school nurses have the necessary resources and support to effectively fulfill this critical role?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Excellent discussion thread, everyone! I wholeheartedly agree with Kate and Ellen that strengthening partnerships between school nurses, teachers, and healthcare providers will significantly enhance our COVID-19 response. Implementing regular protocol reviews led by school nurses makes perfect sense, given their proximity to our student population and deep understanding of emerging health trends. To formalize this process, I propose establishing a District Health Advisory Committee comprised of school nurses, administrators, and healthcare experts. This collaborative body would assess our protocols' effectiveness, stay abreast of changing guidelines, and advise on evidence-based improvements. Ellen, I'll ask our team to draft a proposal outlining the committee's structure and responsibilities for our next meeting. Shall we also invite representatives from local healthcare organizations to share their input and expertise in shaping this initiative?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "That sounds like an excellent move forward David. Inviting health care organizations can help amplify their expertise while ensuring their involvement and buy-in for developing effective health protocols for our students. Another key point worth exploring is the need to address the digital divide, making sure all families are well-equipped for remote learning or virtual communication as we strengthen our responses to ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic. What measures can we put in place to bridge that gap more proactively going forward?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Absolutely, Jonno. The digital divide remains a pressing concern, particularly as we consider blended learning models and virtual communication channels. To address this, I propose we allocate additional resources towards device distribution programs and internet access initiatives for underserved households. We've had success with our partnerships with local ISPs, offering discounted rates for low-income families; let's explore ways to expand and promote these efforts. Furthermore, we can repurpose some of our existing Family Engagement funds to provide digital literacy training for parents, empowering them to support their children's online learning journeys. Grahan, could you brief us on the current state of our device distribution program and any promising leads on expanding our reach to more families in need?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Yes, thank you very much, Dave. Currently, we have approximately 450 devices available for checkout across all grade levels. While our initial distribution targeted kindergarten through third-grade students, we're actively soliciting donations of gently used or new devices for middle school learners. With the assistance of a $50,000 grant secured earlier this year, we've been able to purchase Chromebooks, iPads, and laptops for distribution.  Moving forward, my suggestion would be to look at opportunities where we can engage community partners that can provide discounts, especially with regard to internet service providers. We know that we currently have families paying extremely high prices for limited bandwidth. If we can get better prices through community partnerships or bulk purchases, that can make a huge difference for a lot of our families, not just students but all members in the household. We can potentially work together with those groups to see if there's some cost savings we can get for families. And lastly, maybe a part of the literacy piece that we include in a lot of our other supports could talk about digital literacy around remote learning because some families don't fully appreciate the expectations involved. How does it operate? How does a teacher communicate virtually with their students? And then again, how can we set expectations properly for the full array of things so students and families truly do succeed when engaged in distance learning activities? So yes, I think our first call would be for a survey and then following up with more conversations with staff members who are doing this regularly right now to gain insight into the specific areas where people need further support. Thanks.  Thank you.  Any further items under that item under new business?  No announcements for closed sessions today. There was no request for the special session this month. Mr Alcaro moves that our next regular school board meeting would be on June 14th. Is there a second? Second by Dr. Acuff. All right, then the June meeting has moved to July 12th, unless further called. If there's nothing else we need do, we can close our meeting and the 2020-2021 school year. On the motion by Dr. Delmer, I'm closing this meeting. Is it seconded? It has been seconded. Any other items coming before that? Then I'm adjourning this meeting. Our time tonight is 8:38 PM. So 8:39 PM when this happened. Thank you, folks for being patient with me"
