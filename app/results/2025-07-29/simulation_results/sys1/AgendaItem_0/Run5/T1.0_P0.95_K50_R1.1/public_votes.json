    "comment": "30 pm. I do now move to go into closed session per Annotated Code of Virginia Section 2251.1 of the Virginia Freedom Information Act for personnel matter item number one A. Is there a second? Are those seconds shown in the chat, second to motion? Yeah. And all those voting in favor say aye. Any opposed? Okay. That ends open session. We will continue in closed session. And then our minutes for this meeting will be available at our next regular business meeting in October when it is approved by this body. Thank you all again. Thanks for being here and we're out of here at 10:31 pm. Have a great night everyone."
