    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.1: COVID Mask Policy - The board will discuss the district\u2019s COVID-19 health protocols, specifically whether students should be required to wear masks while in classrooms. This policy would apply during the regular school day, with exceptions for lunch and designated mask-break periods. The goal is to balance student safety with comfort and learning effectiveness.. Who would like to start?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Thanks Graham. I'll kick off our discussion. A key consideration is the rapidly changing nature of this pandemic. Our case rates have been increasing lately, which may change risk assessments and require us to adapt our response strategies. We need to rely on scientific evidence as we make decisions that affect all members of our educational community. What do you think our risk level is at currently?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Jonno Alcaro, thanks so much for starting that out. As it relates to case rate trends, our current transmission rate is high enough that we are still seeing hospitalizations rise here locally. Our hospitals are not overwhelmed yet but there are a number of individuals who have come forward about their concerns with the Delta variant. When looking through what that means for schools, we also know from the American Academy of Pediatrics that children under 12 years old cannot get vaccinated right now, making them more susceptible to serious illness if they contract the virus. So, when considering a potential mitigation strategy such as universal masking inside, we really must keep those considerations top of mind. I'm interested in hearing other thoughts. Do others feel we're striking an appropriate balance between providing a safe environment for kids and understanding the growing concern over COVID-19 cases regionally? Kate Acuff, would you care to weigh in?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thank you, Katrina. It's essential to consider the AAP guidelines and the local hospitalization situation. Given these factors, I believe implementing universal masking indoors is a prudent measure to ensure student safety. Moreover, let's remember our responsibility to protect vulnerable populations within our schools, including young children unable to receive vaccinations and staff with compromised immune systems. By prioritizing caution, we can minimize disruptions to learning and support overall well-being. Ellen Osborne, how does the administration plan to address concerns around effective enforcement and ensuring consistent adherence to the mask-wearing policy?"

    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Judy Le, your emphasis on proactive communication and teacher training resonates strongly with me. Building trust among our stakeholders by being transparent and addressing concerns upfront will indeed facilitate smoother adoption of the mask policy. One potential approach could involve conducting targeted outreach sessions for families with concerns and fostering open dialogue channels throughout the year. Teacher guidance workshops should focus on deescalation techniques, empathy, and constructive responses to resistance. In tandem, we must establish explicit expectations and procedures for handling incidents of non-compliance, maintaining equity across schools and avoiding punitive measures whenever possible. Does anyone else envision incorporating incentives or rewards for good behavior rather than solely emphasizing consequences?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, Kate. I appreciate the suggestions on communication and teacher training. To address David's question on enforcement, our administration proposes a multi-faceted approach. We'll provide clear guidelines and resources for teachers, while also designating school administrators to monitor compliance and offer support. Furthermore, we'll work with our student ambassadors to promote peer-to-peer encouragement and create a culture of mutual respect. Regarding Judy's point on potential pushback, we agree that a compassionate and informative approach is essential. We'll develop a comprehensive FAQ document and host town hall meetings to engage with concerned families.
