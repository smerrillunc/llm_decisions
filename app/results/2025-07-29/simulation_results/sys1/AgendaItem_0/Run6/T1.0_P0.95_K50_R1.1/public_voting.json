Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.1: COVID Mask Policy - The board will discuss the district\u2019s COVID-19 health protocols, specifically whether students should be required to wear masks while in classrooms. This policy would apply during the regular school day, with exceptions for lunch and designated mask-break periods. The goal is to balance student safety with comfort and learning effectiveness.. Who would like to start?"

    "content": "Dr. Paige, thank you very much. I'll start just briefly. In my listening sessions and conversations throughout the community over the past few weeks, there seems to be varying levels of concern related to mask-wearing and, of course, health protocols. What's clear to me is that our students are watching us, as leaders, closely. As we make decisions about these protocols, we're modeling what it means to prioritize community care and community risk-assessment strategies going forward. So, how do I measure out what might seem like competing values when considering whether we implement a full mandate versus no mandate at all and some intermediate steps?  There's an equity issue here. It's not even close in terms of whose voices need to be heard as part of this analysis. And there's the impact of decision-making on different learners in a classroom, which may be differently affected by the need for facial expression cues. But one thing, as I look around this table, I feel incredibly fortunate because, at least from where I sit right now, each one of us comes with so many questions and concerns grounded in compassion and good intent. I look forward to unpacking some of those concerns through the data tonight. And that's all. Thank you.  Thank you, Dr. Paige.  Thank you, everybody else. I am done for now.  Thank you very much. For my first question, Dr. Osborne, can you walk us through current case rates, contact-tracing information, and our own assessment of transmission risks within the K to 12 setting? And can you tell us more about any specific studies that suggest that wearing face coverings in public areas actually helps minimize the spread of COVID-19, if you could help clarify what the science says in your first round-up tonight.   Kate, I know your division has done incredible work to try to understand better why parents have either chosen hybrid or virtual options this year, maybe based on their own family circumstances. Have there been findings that are telling them they'd prefer more flexibility around wearing masks, that we can use to better inform the process here today too.  Finally, Graham, and this one has kept me up more than once lately: How does the superintendent intend to respond if after hearing public comments this evening, there still remain substantial parental fears regarding potential exposure for people coming to learn if they choose not to opt-in for masking inside their buildings during class times? If we take away that option completely or if we don"

    "content": "Thank you, Jon, for bringing a really valuable perspective to this topic. To answer your first question, I do want to talk a little bit about what we've learned recently, so I appreciate you asking me to provide additional context on current cases, contact-tracing efforts, and assessing transmission risks in schools. As you know, in Albemarle County, since July 15th when the VDH changed from tracking individual exposures within cohorts to a more robust algorithm tracking the overall community spread, that's changed what gets reported to local education agencies. We have seen spikes periodically, and even within the last week we saw significant numbers of cases across our elementary schools due to the high case rate of respiratory illness currently present in our community. What is most helpful are measures to gauge risk and prevent further transmission, such as keeping a focus on monitoring self-screening for students and staff, proper hand hygiene, physical distancing, and enhanced ventilation practices. The importance of maintaining the highest level of rigor around cleaning and disinfection in facilities is crucial. Now, Dr. Alcaro referenced transmission risk within the K to 12 setting. I'd like to acknowledge that schools cannot isolate themselves from broader community infection rates. Our approach thus far has taken guidance from the Virginia Department of Education, VDOH, and CDC, along with local medical expertise. To your final point, if our decision leads to fear or dissatisfaction among families who chose to enroll either virtually or under our hybrid schedule, I believe we must keep channels open for dialogue with stakeholders. I think transparency from the very beginning is key here, staying receptive to feedback and demonstrating empathy in whatever path we decide upon is essential. One way could be organizing town hall meetings after we announce any decision made this fall. Another avenue is simply encouraging email updates after any changes, so people stay informed. A third strategy could involve hosting listening sessions for both the community at-large and stakeholder groups separately to voice concerns and gain a sense of shared responsibility around addressing those fears."

    "content": "Thank you very much, Katrina. It was good to hear that clarity, especially on trying to separate out, you know, case rates within schools versus community case rates. I didn't quite get it from my reading of the materials. That clarifies that a great deal. I appreciate that, and so, yes, I had planned to say that we don't live outside of the greater Charlottesville/Albemarle communities ourselves, and we also have to keep a pulse on what they report locally in the community and beyond, not simply the schools. What I was hoping was, can anyone offer insights into perhaps peer-reviewed research that's come out on mask efficacy? I'm familiar with that Brown University study published in August, but it would interest me to hear of other recent work that sheds light on things that we can factor into our discussions and decision here. Or did someone have a link or resource on masks in a controlled environment with known variables? What we might consider are other safety nets that don't have the same negative repercussions possibly on certain subgroups in classrooms. Are there methods of providing alternative forms of accommodations or supports for teachers who might have special needs and then in our exceptional kids who also have unique requirements, like visual aids to aid communication and connection with peers and teachers? Is someone looking down that line today or next steps with some research recommendations or evidence we can build off of?"

  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "I would like to touch base on Jon's excellent points. I appreciate the desire to delve deeper into research supporting mask-wearing. According to Dr. JAMA Pediatrics' publication, \"Community Use of Face Masks and COVID-19\" that came out this summer, using masks decreases the odds of COVID-19 infection by approximately 50% when users adhere strictly. Another study published in Health Affairs found that widespread adoption of cloth masks resulted in a considerable reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Furthermore, this past month, PLOS Medicine presented compelling evidence showing that universal masking led to an 82% decrease in hospital-acquired transmissions.  Dr. Alcaro's query about accommodations is similarly crucial; indeed, alternative strategies to support educators with distinct necessities and exceptional students may emerge as invaluable assets to our inclusive learning spaces. Perhaps we should explore partnerships with educational researchers or experts specializing in assistive technology to shed more insight on these important considerations.  Additionally, could any administrators discuss their thoughts around implementation logistics? Would enforcement rely on in-classroom supervision, administrative oversight, or some combination? How will these procedures safeguard against inconsistencies within the system and ensure fairness throughout the district?"

    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thank you, David, for highlighting the significance of evidence-based research in informing our decision-making process. The studies you mentioned demonstrate the effectiveness of mask-wearing in reducing COVID-19 transmission. I wholeheartedly agree with your suggestion to collaborate with experts in assistive technology to identify alternative strategies for accommodating educators and exceptional students. In terms of implementation logistics, I propose that we establish clear guidelines and protocols for consistent enforcement across the district. This could include training for staff and students on proper mask use, regular spot checks, and a system for addressing non-compliance in a fair and supportive manner. By doing so, we can create a safe and inclusive learning environment while minimizing disruptions to instruction."

    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Judy, I completely concur with your proposition for developing clear guidelines and protocols to ensure equitable enforcement across the district. The provision of training for both staff and students on correct mask usage is vital, as is instilling a culture of accountability through routine spot checks. Moreover, creating a fair yet supportive response to instances of non-compliance would help maintain a positive learning atmosphere. I would like to add that transparency and ongoing communication with stakeholders are critical components of successful policy implementation. Regularly updating families, teachers, and students about our processes and addressing any concerns they may raise will help foster trust and cooperation within the school community. What are your thoughts on including student representatives in these conversations, perhaps through student council or focus groups, to garner valuable perspectives from their end?"
  },

    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "I absolutely agree with you, David, on the importance of transparency, ongoing communication, and inclusivity in implementing our policies effectively. Incorporating student voices through representative bodies like student council or focus groups is an excellent idea. It not only acknowledges their agency in the learning environment but also helps us better understand their concerns, ideas, and experiences. This participatory approach can lead to more targeted and responsive solutions that cater to diverse student needs, ultimately enhancing their overall wellbeing and academic success."
  },

    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Well said, Judy! By empowering student voices, we can ensure that our decisions remain grounded in their realities and priorities, ultimately leading to more effective and student-centered solutions. This synergy between administration, educators, and students can indeed yield remarkable outcomes. Moving forward, let's make sure to schedule dedicated time slots for meaningful consultations with our student representatives to ensure that their input is meaningfully integrated into our decision-making processes. Shall we task Graham to facilitate coordination with student council leaders and arrange for regular check-ins?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Absolutely right, Dave, Judy.  And thank you for that suggestion. We know the energy has been building up among our community members. And I think we have to continue to prioritize that active listening along with seeking out opportunities for shared understanding between adults and youth alike. As always, let's make sure to follow through upon agreed-upon action items so the community knows that if we commit to doing something that it truly happens consistently moving forward. So yeah, I'd be happy to facilitate those connections with student council leaders and work with Kate and others as well in order to facilitate that.   Dave, you've already asked such a robust question that ties into a multitude of themes, but I wonder if I could ask one as it pertains to your previous inquiry about whether staff members were allowed exceptions based on their individual situations, and also just the overall awareness level that staff members have, do any board members have recommendations on how to increase that education component so people feel supported enough to wear the masks correctly and also be made aware of any potential circumstances where a particular teacher could either request or require medical accommodations. I really thought very well on all fronts of your question, and I hope we can dig into each individual aspect before making a decision on this matter. But, I was really thinking about Dr. Haas and his experience after he received the vaccine this week. He talked about his apprehension at first before realizing that even getting the shot comes with a couple of side effects.  That just made me realize that we all need a healthy dose of compassion and empathy going into every discussion of this because it affects everyone differently. We need that sort of spirit going forward for each meeting of all these different committees as much as every opportunity that presents itself inside these conversations.  Yes, that's all for now.  Thank you for allowing that, Mr. Page. I see Dr. Acuff smiling over there. I guess we're waiting for Ellen or you too maybe go. Or John Noah has looked good many times and I still couldn't tell whether he wanted it, nor can I tell with you at this moment but maybe after Ms. Colesin just takes her comments.  Okay, sorry. Go ahead, Ellen, and then we'll move onto whatever else we got, Dr. Aculf. And John Alcaro.  Right? And so, we'll start with you, Ellen."

Before we jump back into the conversation, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the gravity of the situation we're navigating and express my heartfelt appreciation for the commitment to collaboration displayed by this committee thus far. Our discussions today serve as a testament to our shared dedication to ensuring the safety and well-being of our students, educators, and broader community. Building upon Graham's sentiment, I believe it's essential that we embody empathy and compassion as we grapple with the complexities surrounding mask-wearing mandates and exceptions. These nuanced considerations necessitate thorough understanding and proactive communication. Given the multifaceted nature of this topic, I recommend that we dedicate our next meeting to delving deeper into the issues at hand. To that end, I suggest that we assemble an ad hoc committee consisting of key stakeholders from various sectors of the district to conduct a detailed analysis of the current mask mandate, its impact on students, and potential adjustments to support a smooth transition towards safer and healthier environments. Their findings and recommendations will inform future policy adaptations and refinement. How do my fellow committee members envision this taskforce operating? Would it be beneficial to engage outside consultants and/or draw on the expertise of local healthcare professionals to supplement our own in-house knowledge? And what timeframe should we aim for in receiving their report and enacting subsequent changes?"

Additionally, engaging outside consultants or experts can bring fresh insights and objective analysis to the table. A reasonable timeline for the committee to submit their findings and recommendations would be around 6-8 weeks, which would allow for thorough exploration without undue delay.

The diverse stakeholder representation you suggested will undoubtedly enrich our decision-making process. I concur that a timeline of 6-8 weeks provides a suitable window for the committee to conduct their research and gather valuable feedback. To further solidify our approach, I propose that we outline specific objectives for the ad hoc committee to investigate during their deliberations. Some possible areas of focus could include analyzing data on mask efficacy in schools, assessing accommodation options for students and staff with disabilities or underlying conditions, and exploring innovative strategies to promote mask compliance. By defining clear goals, we can help guide the committee's efforts and ensure that their report is actionable and comprehensive. How do committee members perceive this framework, and what additional areas would they recommend the ad hoc committee examine during their investigation?"

And just like Graham said, I think what's most important here is maintaining equity across all levels while dealing with these difficult choices, especially in this time with ongoing community spread. Kate mentioned earlier her concerns about some kids who have trouble wearing masks, or might be uncomfortable physically, emotionally, etc., along these lines, I'm worried that if we only accommodate those who request such provisions that other kids, possibly due to socio-economic reasons or otherwise may not receive the same advantages given to certain individuals. What would happen in cases like these where their lives and learning experiences will not be on equal footing after we make these exceptions? I believe it is crucial that we keep this consideration front and center as we plan our strategy, and that we try our best to close this gap whenever and wherever it arises within our system. Thanks, Ms. Colemsan."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "As much as anything Jonno, I completely agree with everything you've said. From an organizational standpoint, we really need to take a hard look at how we develop these individual plans for each student because every single one is unique in some way, form, or fashion. One suggestion I want to throw out for the record is, perhaps the board could consider creating an appeals process or even kind of a variance request procedure where families can petition on behalf of their child because there simply will be no way you could draft an exception policy that captures every single special circumstance that could arise. I think the more layers of protection we incorporate into that process, the better off we will be in making sure that everyone gets fair shake. We do not want to inadvertently create any inequalities and as Dr. Alcaro was pointing out. So I definitely think incorporating something of that nature where people can petition and advocate for their kids is a crucial step that we must take in creating the most inclusive policy possible.  But again, just because that is something that should be considered does not mean I think we should slow down on this. I firmly believe we cannot wait another day before initiating the implementation of mask mandates at ACS. There were plenty of people talking about it at the last board meeting, people who don't have a voice at this table or maybe not part of the administration currently actively asking us to please take action. And I think that's a crucial element of the story here. Our communities trust us implicitly because they expect us to follow the science behind us when we're taking these measures. So thank you very much. Now Ms. Osborn could you respond as well and so could John David. What do I think the role of the task force would entail? First off, I wholeheartedly believe Kate Acuff's idea of having these meetings with Dr. Hancock and other county leaders would actually prove quite beneficial because I am genuinely convinced that having consistent messages coming from us would ultimately bolster our credibility locally and beyond. Perhaps they could discuss things as simple as how are they handling the tracking of positive case loads as well as contract tracing efforts when someone tests positive while they are at the workplace, at home or in some other non-school location. So there could be a host of ways we could learn best practices from them. I think a lot of the work they're doing that we're trying to duplicate as a school system and would be more effective if we had their buy-in upfront rather than running parallel tracks."

Jonno raises a critical point about ensuring equity among students, particularly those who might not have the resources to request accommodations.

To build upon these ideas, I suggest the ad hoc committee also explore ways to address potential disparities in access to masks, mask-wearing education, and support systems for students who struggle with mask compliance. This could involve partnerships with local organizations or community groups to provide resources and outreach. Furthermore, I endorse Katrina's emphasis on expeditiously implementing mask mandates while concurrently developing a comprehensive policy.
