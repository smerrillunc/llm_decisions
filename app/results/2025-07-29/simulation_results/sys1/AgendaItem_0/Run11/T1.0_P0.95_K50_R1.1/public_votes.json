    "comment": "yes. Does anything else need to be said? Can we please get another second? Second from Dr. Johnstone. Are there any other comments regarding the motion? If there are no other comments, then Mrs. Green will take a roll call vote and tell us if we've got five or more affirmative votes to pass this motion. I would also like for Ms. Graham to read again that long part about voting electronically. All right now, do you want to go ahead and do your thing. We can move that one over too. All right, then let them bring the laptops up here now. This way we're doing paper ballots instead of electronically now. And if they have their electronic device, they'll continue to use theirs because those will still work through Zoom so as soon as we can figure out how to make everything official on that end, we'll proceed with the meeting and roll-call vote. Ms. Green, when we're ready, could you give me what our rules say regarding electronic voting that these folks needed to hear about tonight? We heard Ms. Green remind everyone of the policy relating to the use of electronic devices during public meetings that was approved by this board earlier. Then we saw several School Board members provide their names for an audible vote since some members are attending the meeting electronically due to Virginia\\u00a0s active emergency due to COVID-19 or if the Governor grants permission, allowing remote meetings. They provided their names for anyone who chose only audio connections on Zoom and might not see their name appear. Members have been reminded to unmute themselves prior to giving their names for the rollcall vote and keep both the microphone muted and cameras off while waiting on the rollcall vote during the meeting to help maintain order during the electronic attendance process as required by the Code of Virginia and the Freedom of Information Act. Allowing all citizens to electronically attend was made possible by HB1838 passed by the General Assembly in April and signed into law by the governor providing the means to practice social distancing to protect health while continuing important governing matters amid\\u00a0the pandemic.\\n\\nIt is at this point when"
