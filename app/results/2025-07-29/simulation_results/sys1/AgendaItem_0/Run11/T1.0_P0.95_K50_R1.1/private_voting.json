    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.1: COVID Mask Policy - The board will discuss the district\u2019s COVID-19 health protocols, specifically whether students should be required to wear masks while in classrooms. This policy would apply during the regular school day, with exceptions for lunch and designated mask-break periods. The goal is to balance student safety with comfort and learning effectiveness.. Who would like to start?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "I think a good starting point would be reviewing our current situation, including case rates and hospitalization data. Dr. Osborne mentioned last week that while we are not where we were last year, transmission levels do remain higher than ideal. Dr. Oberg, can you share an update on these metrics and what they mean for risk assessment?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thank you, Jonno. Yes, let me provide that context. Currently, our county's seven-day average case rate per 100,000 residents stands at 125, which puts us in the moderate-to-high transmission range. Hospitalization rates have also seen a slight uptick, particularly among younger age groups. While our numbers aren't as dire as they were last winter, we must acknowledge that risk still exists, especially for those with compromised immune systems or underlying conditions. Our responsibility, as educators, is to ensure that we're taking reasonable measures to mitigate transmission within our schools, striking that delicate balance between safety and maintaining an effective learning environment."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "In that light, Dr. Oberg, could you explain how wearing face masks contribute to mitigation? We discussed it briefly last week. And also I am aware that we need to have discussions around vaccination requirements or other measures. So there is quite a bit going on here, but could you just give us an overview of masks and what kind of protection do they offer in terms of preventing further spread of COVID-19 within our schools?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Katrina, that's a great segue. Yes, face masks play a crucial role in reducing transmission by decreasing the emission of respiratory droplets that carry the virus. Studies consistently show that proper mask-wearing can lower transmission risk by 50% to 70%. Moreover, multiple layers of fabric in a well-fitting mask can filter out approximately 80% to 90% of viral particles. When combined with other measures, such as distancing, hand hygiene, and ventilation, masks become an even more effective tool in our arsenal against COVID-19 spread within schools. This is particularly important for our unvaccinated students, immunocompromised individuals, and others who may be more susceptible to severe illness."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Building upon Dr. Oberg's points about masks' effectiveness in reducing transmission risks, I'd like to shift the focus to their impact on student wellbeing and learning. Research suggests that when implemented correctly, masking policies have minimal disruption to educational activities, yet some parents and students express concerns about potential negative effects on emotional wellbeing, communication barriers, and educational outcomes. Can we delve into the nuances of this trade-off and explore ways to address potential drawbacks while prioritizing student safety? It's essential to consider both sides and weigh the benefits of mask-wearing against any potential drawbacks to ensure that we adopt a comprehensive strategy catering to diverse needs and perspectives."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Greatly appreciate Judy's insightful comments and inquiry. To build on her thoughts, I propose we also examine the ways we can support students who might struggle due to mask mandates, considering alternative methods for facilitating social interaction and expression, ensuring access to counseling services if needed. Additionally, let's engage teachers and staff regarding strategies for instructional adaptability and fostering inclusive environments despite mask-related adjustments. By doing so, we'll enhance our capacity to meet students' varying needs and promote academic success. It's crucial to find solutions where all students feel supported and heard throughout this process.  How might we facilitate better connections and support systems amidst possible challenges arising from prolonged mask use?"

  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Excellent points, Kate. I wholeheartedly agree that supporting students' social-emotional needs and promoting inclusive learning environments are crucial considerations in our mask policy. As we explore strategies for facilitating connection and support, let's draw on existing resources, such as our counseling services and mental health teams, to ensure equitable access for all students. We should also engage with teachers, staff, and students themselves to co-create solutions that cater to diverse needs and preferences. By doing so, we can foster a sense of community and belonging while prioritizing safety."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I totally concur with Ellen's emphasis on leveraging existing resources and engaging key stakeholders in our approach. We've already seen successful models of collaboration in action through our social-emotional learning initiatives and equity coalitions.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Absolutely, Kate. Involving our equity coalitions and social-emotional learning teams will help us develop culturally responsive and trauma-informed approaches to supporting students. Additionally, let's ensure that we're providing adequate training and resources for teachers and staff to effectively implement mask-wearing policies and accommodations, particularly for students with disabilities or underlying health conditions. This will require careful consideration of individualized education plans (IEPs) and Section 504 accommodation plans to guarantee that we're meeting our legal obligations while prioritizing student wellbeing."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Yes, Ellen, your point about providing necessary training and resources to teachers and staff resonates deeply. For instance, some students with sensory processing disorders may require different types of masks or adaptations. Ensuring our educators understand these unique needs will not only help us uphold our commitments under IEPs and Section 504 plans but also promote inclusive practices throughout our school communities. We should also consider hosting training sessions specifically focused on addressing mask-wearing difficulties in special education settings. This comprehensive approach will help create safer, more supportive environments for all learners."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "I echo Kate's sentiments regarding teacher preparedness. To further reinforce inclusivity, it would be beneficial to set up a dedicated hotline or email channel where teachers and staff can reach out to district experts with questions or concerns related to accommodating students with unique needs during mask-wearing periods. This resource will enable us to respond promptly and provide tailored support as needed, which ultimately enhances overall implementation and better serves our diverse student body."
