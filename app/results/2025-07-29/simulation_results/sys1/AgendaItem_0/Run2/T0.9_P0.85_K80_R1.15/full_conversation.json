    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.1: COVID Mask Policy - The board will discuss the district\u2019s COVID-19 health protocols, specifically whether students should be required to wear masks while in classrooms. This policy would apply during the regular school day, with exceptions for lunch and designated mask-break periods. The goal is to balance student safety with comfort and learning effectiveness.. Who would like to start?"

    "content": "Thanks, Graham. To frame our conversation, I'd love to share some context about where we are right now as a county and school system. In terms of transmission rates and vaccination numbers, I think it's essential that we all have the most current information. What do you suggest, Dr. Osborne, Ellen, do you want to bring us up-to-date before we jump into the actual masking issue itself?\n```"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Absolutely, Jonno. Thank you for setting the stage. According to the latest data from the CDC and local health authorities, our county is currently experiencing moderate to high transmission rates of COVID-19. While vaccination rates among adults and older teens are promising, we still have significant segments of our population, including younger children, who remain vulnerable. Given these factors, it's crucial we carefully weigh the benefits and drawbacks of mask-wearing in schools to ensure we're providing a safe environment for all students and staff."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "That was very helpful, thank you so much. There is certainly no shortage of opinions out there on both sides of this issue. As leaders here today, though, I believe our primary concern has got to be making an informed decision based on evidence that supports student well-being and academic success. We need to look at not only the potential health implications but also how wearing masks might impact teaching and learning across our schools. Dr. Page, what guidance can we glean from your team regarding the likely effect of masked instruction on teacher-student interactions and overall classroom dynamics?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Yeah, no, thanks, Johnno.  You know, there's been quite a bit of research conducted since last spring and even over the summer regarding mask use within educational settings. And I'm just going to highlight several points because I don't want to keep everybody too long. But really three things come out strongly. One, universally, research suggests that masks help prevent spread when they fit properly.  Second, effective communication is absolutely key to successful teaching and learning. So there may need to be adjustments made by teachers using clear enunciation, using facial expressions intentionally, body language.  Thirdly, social-emotional well-being must continue being a top priority. So we've got to remember we're all trying to get through this together. If kids feel isolated, disconnected, we'll see long-term negative consequences. Kate Acuff did speak earlier and she shared her survey results around increased anxiety levels which were significant. Allowing opportunities for break times without masks could be part of that mitigation strategy. So those are kind of three takeaways from the instructional lens that might influence how we make decisions on masking.  If any other folks wanted to add anything or elaborate on either one of those dimensions please go ahead.\n```"

    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I appreciate these insightful comments. I agree completely that we must prioritize the physical and emotional safety of students, especially given that many still aren't eligible for vaccines yet. Dr. Page, could you comment further on ways we could support teachers adapting their methods for effective instruction behind masks? Also, have you considered offering any additional resources or training for educators dealing with the unique challenges posed by mask mandates?\n``` Unknownspeaker: Yes, I'll do that. It seems like if it was a mandate, you had to put it in place quickly, then you work out the details later. And again, I think I understand that's probably true everywhere else as well. Now we're saying, \"Wait a minute, let's figure out the details.\" So first of all, our teachers are pretty flexible. They adapt well to whatever situation comes along. On the flip side of that coin, I think we would provide more professional development to them. For example, as we move forward with technology, you know, recording yourself and watching yourself teach helps identify areas you might improve upon. So maybe having video cameras installed in each room so people can record themselves, watch it back and say, \"I didn't realize my tone changed so dramatically when I started talking,\" or something like that.  Teachers could reflect on their own practice. A lot of teachers actually prefer to watch themselves after class and critique their lesson plans and their execution thereof. However, for students with disabilities, it's very different. Some of them cannot wear masks due to certain conditions such as respiratory issues. Others may struggle significantly with hearing impaired individuals whose speech recognition skills drop off precipitously when someone wears a face shield. We had a family who called me yesterday evening who said their son wore glasses constantly fogging up when he tried wearing a face shield.   We have an accommodation process already set up for families seeking relief for various reasons under Section 504 Plans and Individualized Education Programs.  We have individualized accommodations that address specific needs on a case-by-case basis. And so while they follow universal precautions and the same expectations as others, perhaps there's another option for them.  For instance, that child could join via virtual platform with his peers at least temporarily until the pandemic goes away. So I think accommodations are available and doable. It's critical to find the best possible solution while acknowledging that flexibility would be required across the board. ```"
