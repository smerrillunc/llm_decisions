    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.1: COVID Mask Policy - The board will discuss the district\u2019s COVID-19 health protocols, specifically whether students should be required to wear masks while in classrooms. This policy would apply during the regular school day, with exceptions for lunch and designated mask-break periods. The goal is to balance student safety with comfort and learning effectiveness.. Who would like to start?"

    "content": "Thank you, Graham. I'd appreciate a few words from our administration team about the current pandemic situation, just an update where we are. Kate Acuff, could you help us here? What are our current numbers? Any specific considerations that have informed your recommendations going forward?.  We must assess these critical factors: case rates, masking efficacy, instructional impact. And what of student wellbeing and exceptions too. How do we protect all children yet ensure equity for every student? These points I expect to come into play as I deliberate. All voices welcome. Please weigh in as you see fit. Forgive me if I am forgetting anything. It's been quite some time since we went back last year. How does this work at the high school in particular? Is it being done on an individual basis, or by group or by class size?. At any rate, Graham Paige, maybe you can clarify that one point. But certainly Dr. Oberg, if possible, to talk to the question raised earlier -  What measures can schools take as they face more stringent measures but still have flexibility?  Then  a little down the road perhaps - When the community moves to a moderate risk level? Kate and Katrina, the local healthcare professional  as well. As you talked just now, both agreed you may want to make further comments at the bottom. I've heard it said sometimes about a certain point in history that might get made which doesn't make sense without the rest of this data. We may revisit this topic down the line again, either in two weeks or who knows how long, with different data. I think to make a decision tonight, though, Kate and Katrina you'll know the right approach for sure once we hear the information as per your recommendation. Right? Or is there another direction this policy would need to head?. In your judgement, what could have been the other option that we're considering this time to say that the school system is taking this more extreme measure? Just in terms of those three areas, because this would give all of them all the protection that all our stakeholders value so much. That is very helpful. So then the real answer is no, then why isn't there not really more school systems adopting that? Because of what we mentioned before, there has to be a plan. They can tell them they won't be attending, that their child will learn remote; the parents can tell that. If they aren there will not be attendance, they can just go the online"

    "content": "Our recent infection statistics indicate 50 positive cases over the past week. As you may recall, last month we were averaging closer to five to ten per week. Furthermore, the R-naught, otherwise known as our transmission rate has been climbing in excess of 2 percent for several weeks, as the CDC notes the goal is lower than 0.8 percent. If one considers all regional healthcare providers plus UVA Health, hospitalization rates were reported recently to be roughly twenty-six patients within the ICUs across each care facility in the area when I spoke with them two days ago, representing a slight upsurge. However, please note this might fluctuate. And to the second component which seems most directly relevant to today's deliberation \u2013 mask use efficiency. Our district partnered with the University to conduct research regarding how effectively mask-wearing was in reducing transmission rates for various scenarios throughout our buildings based upon real life situations and classroom interactions between students, educators, as well as other members of staff. From what we observed, 85% coverage of all faces led to a dramatic suppression in spread across every single scenario. The converse proved equally illuminating. To consider the reverse side of that coin, our researchers estimated if less than half of users were complying consistently at our facilities daily, even if not uniformly wearing them,  that strategy would offer nearly no advantages against transmissions happening within school settings as originally intended.\n```"

    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Many thanks, Katrina, for providing that crucial context. I share Jonno's concerns regarding student well-being and the need for equity in our approach. With our current infection rates and transmission rate above the desired threshold, it's clear that we must prioritize caution. Given the research findings you presented, I agree that mask-wearing can be an effective tool in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 within our schools. However, we also need to consider the potential impacts on student learning and engagement. Have we gathered any data on how mask-wearing affects teacher-student interaction, student participation, and overall academic performance? Additionally, what accommodations can we make for students who may struggle with mask-wearing due to medical conditions or other legitimate reasons? We must strive for fairness and equity in our approach while keeping student safety paramount. Ellen, would you like to contribute any insights on the educational aspects of this matter?"

  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, David. Yes, I'd like to highlight that our teaching staff has expressed concerns about the potential negative impact of prolonged mask-wearing on student engagement and social skills development. While the data supports the effectiveness of masks in reducing transmission rates, we cannot overlook the importance of facial expressions and nonverbal cues in the learning process. Additionally, some students may experience anxiety or discomfort while wearing masks, which could affect their ability to focus and learn. To address these concerns, we've developed strategies such as regular breaks for mask-free outdoor activities, alternative forms of communication, and flexible arrangements for students who require accommodations. We're committed to finding a balance between safety and supporting the whole-child approach to education. I'd love to hear more from Graham on how we can implement these measures effectively and equitably across our schools."

    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Thank you, Ellen. And thank you to our entire team, and Jon, it will indeed be done on a case-by-case basis, and it could be individually, or on a cohort basis where necessary.   It really has to depend on the needs of the students.  But yes, all those are things that we take into account when developing our mitigation strategies as we try to support that delicate balance that David mentioned between keeping kids safe in schools and supporting their social emotional and instructional needs.  That really gets to the heart of our work as educators.  Thank you. And I do appreciate Kate's comment about revisiting this later on.\n```"

    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thank you, Graham. In alignment with our values of equity and inclusivity, I believe we must emphasize both the importance of masking and its potential challenges, recognizing that students' experiences vary greatly. Some may face difficulties due to health conditions, others may feel anxious about expressing themselves behind masks. To truly serve our students well, it's essential we develop tiered plans addressing individual needs while ensuring universal precautions in place for everyone's well-being. This might include special accommodations, counseling services, or targeted interventions to address social and emotional struggles. I recommend scheduling follow-up discussions to refine these strategies further, as we continue to weigh case rates and adapt our response accordingly."

  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "I completely agree with Kate's emphasis on equity and inclusivity. We must acknowledge the disparate impacts of mask-wearing on different student populations and proactively develop solutions to mitigate these effects. Moreover, I suggest we explore innovative approaches to facilitate student expression and socialization despite the physical barriers imposed by masks. For instance, incorporating virtual breakout rooms or designated'mask-break' areas during recess can help foster connections among students. By prioritizing empathy and creativity in our response, we can better support our students' holistic growth and wellbeing amidst these unprecedented circumstances."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Judy, your ideas resonate deeply with me. The breakout room concept holds promise, allowing students to maintain relationships while staying safe. We should also examine our curriculum and instructional methods to ensure that they align with the needs of our diverse student body. I think we could benefit from a collaboration with teachers to identify opportunities for modifications that enable inclusive and engaging lesson delivery. Moreover, we should discuss offering extra support structures for vulnerable groups like English language learners and students with disabilities, whose needs may be exacerbated by the mask mandate. By taking proactive steps towards student-centered solutions, we can minimize the negative impact of mask-wearing on their well-being and academic achievement."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Kate, I couldn't agree more. Collaboration with our teaching staff is crucial in identifying and implementing adaptable instruction methods that cater to our students' varied needs. It's also vital that we engage with our students themselves, soliciting their input and feedback to inform our decision-making processes. Let's schedule a working group to gather stakeholders' perspectives and co-design tailored support systems for our most vulnerable students. By doing so, we can ensure our response is not only evidence-based but also rooted in empathy and a deep understanding of our students' lived experiences."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Exactly, Judy! A working group consisting of teachers, administrators, and, most importantly, students can provide invaluable insights, facilitating data-driven decision-making. Their contributions will enable us to craft support mechanisms tailored to specific cohorts, fostering a culture of inclusivity and care. As we move forward, let's commit to scheduled check-ins to monitor progress, gather ongoing feedback, and continuously refine our strategies. By doing so, we'll not only respond to immediate needs but also forge lasting, equitable policies for future generations."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "I'm thrilled to see this rich discussion unfolding. Kate and Judy have beautifully captured the essence of our equity-driven approach. I fully support the suggestion of forming a working group to co-design support systems with teachers, administrators, and students. This collaboration will ensure that our solutions are informed by diverse perspectives and grounded in empathy. To build upon this idea, I propose we establish a feedback loop, where students' voices are regularly amplified through surveys, focus groups, or town hall meetings. This will allow us to adapt our strategies in real-time, addressing emerging concerns and celebrating successes. By empowering our students to shape their own learning environment, we can create a more inclusive, supportive, and effective system for all."

    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "I appreciate the momentum around this proposal. While recognizing the importance of student participation, I want to emphasize the equal significance of involving parents and caregivers in our planning process. Engaging them early and often will increase buy-in, trust, and ultimately, improve implementation efficacy. By incorporating their unique insights and experiences, we'll strengthen our efforts to address disparities and ensure the whole-family approach we aspire to. What are your thoughts on an additional mechanism for parent and caregiver feedback, perhaps alongside the student voices we're prioritizing?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I am absolutely in agreement with Jon about including caregivers and parents in this collaborative process.   One way to consider doing that would be to reconvene our school advisory committee virtually or otherwise,  because there's been a lapse since last semester when they went dark.   That offers an existing structure in which people already know how it functions to provide additional perspective to what is being shared by students and teachers alike.\n```"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Katrina, your suggestion to revive our school advisory committee resonates with me.  It will provide a structured platform for meaningful engagement with parents and caregivers.  How about setting up regular updates via email newsletters to keep all stakeholders informed about COVID-related decisions and adaptations? This keeps families aligned with evolving guidelines while allowing open lines of communication through established channels.  We also need to provide resources for families struggling with remote learning or in need of local healthcare support. With that, we foster a true partnership in maintaining healthy learning environments for our students."
