    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.1: COVID Mask Policy - The board will discuss the district\u2019s COVID-19 health protocols, specifically whether students should be required to wear masks while in classrooms. This policy would apply during the regular school day, with exceptions for lunch and designated mask-break periods. The goal is to balance student safety with comfort and learning effectiveness.. Who would like to start?"

    "content": "I am happy to start, as you know. So, our administration team has been tracking current case rates.  Our community spread continues to rise, with positivity rates at a seven-day average of 9%, higher than the state average. It's crucial we discuss the mitigation strategies we can employ to minimize transmission risks within our schools. What does everyone else have to add?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thank you all for bringing this topic up today because as the health data continues to change it is only natural that we adapt what we do accordingly. We're going to be informed by several studies out there, but even more so by local conditions, which, as Jon pointed out are rising quite significantly. When kids are not masked we see greater community spread.\n```ssiignment risk scores  That goes back to where we were last year  ``` to being fully remote.  And we want to keep this system going because we want to work together with our parents and our teachers who can support each other with some level of consistency. It gets a little messy sometimes, and that's okay. But ultimately, I hope today we can land on something solid enough that supports us moving forward.   I think maybe Dr. Kate Auff was just about to say something, but my apologies, and thank you."

    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thanks, Dave. I'd like to echo both Katrina and Jon's concerns about our rising community spread. As educators, we understand the delicate balance between keeping our students safe and providing an optimal learning environment. With mask-wearing proven to be effective in reducing transmission, I believe mandating their use in classrooms is a necessary precautionary measure. Additionally, I recommend incorporating social distancing measures and increased ventilation strategies to further mitigate risk. Does anyone have questions or additional suggestions on these proposed guidelines?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Kate, I appreciate your emphasis on a multifaceted approach. Incorporating social distancing and ventilation measures could indeed enhance the efficacy of mask-wearing. To build upon your suggestion, I propose we also explore ways to provide mask breaks and create comfortable, well-ventilated areas for students to take brief respites from mask-wearing throughout the day. This could help address concerns around student comfort and wellbeing while maintaining our priority on safety."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Judy, those are excellent ideas! Providing regular mask breaks in designated areas would help alleviate potential discomfort and promote overall student wellbeing. Moreover, I agree that it's essential to strike a balance between safety and comfort to ensure students remain engaged and productive throughout the school day. Can we consider working with our facilities department to identify spaces suitable for these breaks and potentially incorporate outdoor areas with adequate ventilation as options?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Exactly, Kate! Collaborating with our facilities team is key. By utilizing outdoor areas and identifying well-ventilated indoor spaces, we can create safe and comfortable zones for mask breaks. Perhaps we can also involve our student council or wellness committee to gather feedback and input from students themselves, ensuring their needs and perspectives are represented in our decision-making process."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Judy, I couldn't agree more. Engaging our students through the student council or wellness committee will not only provide valuable insights but also foster a sense of ownership and responsibility among them, which is critical for successful implementation. Their voices matter, and we must prioritize their wellbeing. Shall we task our student services team to facilitate student input and feedback, ensuring that we capture diverse perspectives and experiences?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "I completely concur with the importance of involving students in this decision-making process. As we move forward with implementing mask-wearing policies, it's essential to consider the impact on learning and student wellbeing. I suggest we also examine the available research on how mask-wearing affects student engagement, attendance, and academic performance. This evidence-based approach will enable us to make informed decisions that balance safety with educational effectiveness. Can we request a review of relevant studies and data to inform our policy development?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Absolutely, Ellen. That evidence-based approach resonates deeply with me. Let's definitely request a comprehensive analysis of existing research and its findings, so we can draw meaningful conclusions and adjust our strategy accordingly. At the same time, considering our immediate context, given the surge in case rates, I'm hesitant to delay policy adoption any longer. We need to proceed cautiously yet decisively to protect our students and staff. Is there any concern about potential unintended consequences related to mandating masks? How might we proactively mitigate these issues?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "I share your sense of urgency, Jon. While we await the research analysis, let's also discuss potential exceptions and accommodations for students who may face difficulties with mask-wearing due to medical conditions, disabilities, or other factors. We need to ensure equity and inclusivity in our policy, considering the diverse needs of our student population. Perhaps we can establish a clear exemption process and provide alternative solutions for these students, such as virtual learning arrangements or modified masking requirements. Your thoughts, team?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thank you, Ellen. In fact, that goes right to what the Virginia Department of Education recommends, which is having some kind of protocol around exclusions for special circumstances, so I am very open to doing that. You know, that way people still feel included, because they might have different kinds of challenges, and just one size doesn't fit all here. We've got to make sure everybody feels taken care of. So that discussion really needs to come out. Just to circle back too to Graham's original point that started us off today - he mentioned in his initial numbers - which was what led into our broader discussion was his COVID score metrics for various districts across our area. Maybe when we talk about all these pieces falling into place, including Graham's tracking, that can give us a better handle on whether our steps make an improvement in our own COVID rate metrics. And let's go ahead and make this as simple as possible and understandable for folks. We don't have to reinvent the wheel. We're trying to make a good faith effort. If we stay nimble, we can always adjust course. We've done this many times before. We can do it again. I hope we all learned over the past year and a half is that staying flexible is what works best when confronted with unknowns.\n```"

    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Thank you, Katrina. I think part of why I wanted to present all of these things at once, even though we didn't make decisions on everything, is because I do think they interplay together. Our COVID cases and transmission dynamics, how we respond to them, how we assess student learning and student well-being in the midst of this, and then how the whole mask mandate exception piece plays in -  that exception piece is a big piece to manage effectively, if everyone does, I mean, and to support. These aren't little tasks, they're big tasks. But I trust our system and I trust our staff and I trust our community. And I think as we implement these things, we'll figure it out and improve together, which is the nature of public education in the first place. Now, we all need to remember that no decision we make tonight will make everyone happy. We know that, going into the COVID period, right? Because everyone has opinions, everyone's affected differently. But if we keep our core goal in mind, it's supporting every single student. That student, whatever situation they are in today, whether they have a disability, whether they're economically disadvantaged, wherever they are, they deserve the same shot at success that the next kid gets. So let's hold onto that. And our work should lead toward equity, which means we're going to get better each time we work at it. Are there any last-minute suggestions as far as implementation or enforcement go? Do we need a board action now, or shall we wait until we develop our final plan?  And the last thing, Dr. McLaughlin, were you going to make some comments in addition to David, David Oberg and Judy, too, I know asked?  Did y'all have anything you want to add? I guess what I'd like from Dave and Judy is for a report from student services. What I really want you to do is go ahead and prepare something for Wednesday night, so I could hear that, and then it will save us having to bring up new business. Then David can follow up to tell how we'll roll this out, and if anybody from legal wants to speak, or any legal caveats, please. That's our final order for Wednesday night before we take this up officially. Could we have your permission to do what I just suggested, please? If I misinterpreted, Katrina. Anybody who wishes to comment now on any portion of these"

  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Absolutely, Graham, and I appreciate your thorough summary. My primary concern remains the impact on student wellbeing, particularly among our most vulnerable populations. As we move forward with implementation and enforcement strategies, I recommend we prioritize student-centered approaches, involving families and caregivers in the process to ensure their voices are heard. To facilitate this, I suggest allocating resources for targeted outreach programs and providing multilingual support materials to address potential language barriers. Furthermore, I urge us to explore innovative solutions, such as peer-to-peer mentoring initiatives, to foster a sense of community and promote overall student well-being during these challenging times."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thank you, David. I concur with your emphasis on prioritizing student well-being and centered approaches. As we consider implementation and enforcement strategies, it's essential we collect data on student experiences and perceptions to inform our decisions. This data will enable us to identify areas of improvement and evaluate the effectiveness of our policies. Additionally, I propose establishing a student advisory committee to ensure their voices are represented throughout this process, thereby promoting a more inclusive and equitable solution."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I completely agree with what both David and Judy said. I especially want to emphasize that these kids' voices must be heard through this entire thing, so we're not guessing, but actually hearing exactly what their concerns are. We all understand it's been quite a tumultuous time for them. And Judy, great idea on forming the student advisory group, and collecting data, ensuring that diverse perspectives and experiences are truly represented. And David, your peer-to-peer mentoring suggestion also caught my attention. It sounds like a feasible approach towards creating positive connections within their cohort. When considering exceptions and accommodations, I encourage continued collaboration among teachers, staff, students, and families so we build trust and consistency, and thus avoid confusion in our response to the varying needs of all students.  Now, Graham, on implementation, shall we ask the superintendent to develop the plan outline by our meeting on Wednesday, while giving our administrators and school leaders the guidance to provide specific proposals for feedback on Thursday morning?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Yes, Ms. Lee, I think that'd be fair to expect of us. Dr. Haas, Dr. McLaughlin, can you have prepared for Wednesday evening an overall framework, along with any key parts of it Dr. Haas might have ready to share, about how we would roll it out from an administrative perspective? It was requested this evening in the interest of transparency for student representation and how that goes back to us to receive a briefing on it later on in this meeting series. And Mr. Alcaro raised a point that he thinks is important. At our next meeting, we can talk further about COVID and give Dr. McLaughlin feedback on the direction his proposed changes appear to have gone based on this session of COVID policy change, and if not perfect yet, what the superintendent would still need clarification on.  That's my only request for Dr. McLaughlin. Just provide a basic framework that incorporates those elements so we can review and discuss them on Wednesday evening. Are all the rest of you in agreement? No one else has anything else on exceptions, implementation, and enforcement. I'm not going to call it to question. Katrina, are we ready? Please go ahead. Katrina,  do we have another motion on any other element. Okay, thank you very much. Mr. Oberg, do you wish to say any final things in relation to anything, particularly if they come from the student services view, since this is still a bit unsettled at this moment, we may end up adding or changing aspects of this later when more information becomes available. The final request is an update from Student Services concerning where we believe we stand in supporting all students in regards to remote educational instruction provided. Dr. Johnston and all her colleagues may explain on Wednesday evenings about where we currently find ourselves in the area of equity.   In particular, Dr. McLaughlin made a statement that the equity issue was brought forth by me, but I am confident that every single person sitting at this table had to be aware how pressing that issue was as a reality from months back. I do think that part of what Dr. Haas did address was addressing a lot of our remote learning concerns. But that is still in progress. So please allow Dr. McLaughlin to proceed if the people want him to talk at the beginning or the conclusion, which might be true, or somewhere in between. We are now waiting to determine where Mr. Alcaro resides"
