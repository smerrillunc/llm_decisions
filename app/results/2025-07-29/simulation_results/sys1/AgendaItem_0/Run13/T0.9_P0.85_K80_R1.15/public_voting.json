Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.1: COVID Mask Policy - The board will discuss the district\u2019s COVID-19 health protocols, specifically whether students should be required to wear masks while in classrooms. This policy would apply during the regular school day, with exceptions for lunch and designated mask-break periods. The goal is to balance student safety with comfort and learning effectiveness.. Who would like to start?"

    "content": "I'd like to share some insights from our local pediatrician group regarding their support for a universal masking policy. We've received many testimonials on both sides. But as educators, we need to rely on evidence-driven approaches that prioritize equal access to education without putting vulnerable students at risk. As such, considering what we know about Delta variant transmission rates, particularly among children under 12 who cannot yet receive vaccines, it seems reasonable to continue exploring options that ensure all kids can return safely. So I think having more information about current case rates and trends in the county could help inform any decision here. Does anyone have an update?"

    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Our community has seen relatively low numbers lately but still sits at high levels. Dr. Ferguson provided updated data points in his briefing Monday. He mentioned Albemarle County has reported around 130 new cases per week since the middle of July. Hospitalizations are higher now than they were at this time last year when there was no vaccination option available. What concerns me most is how delta spreads so easily through respiratory droplets that may remain airborne longer than those spread by earlier variants. If you'll recall, we previously used the CDC's guidelines because they did offer detailed and regularly-updated guidance specific to K-12 educational settings. Their data show strong evidence of masks reducing transmission within schools. And if nothing else, let us keep following sound scientific principles in order to make decisions. Thanks for bringing up the topic. How do others feel about reviewing this strategy given the updated context and the fact that there might not necessarily be a one-size-fits-all solution. Do people want to explore potential adaptations to account for changes over time? I am just wondering aloud out loud whether that flexibility would make sense to put into place. Would this require further input from our medical professionals, as well? Are these kinds of questions worth pursuing?\n```\ufffd\ufffdunknown person: (unintelligible) question, Kate Acuff had raised her hand. Kate?```\nkateacuff: Yes. There actually have been several requests for me. One thing I wanted to clarify was if I understood your comment correctly, John Alcarez that you wanted to hear from the state and federal government about the new variant. I agree that's important because, in my opinion, part of this issue does get back down to funding and what we're able to accomplish, including things like contact tracing and being prepared if someone tests positive. Is there a process right now where you quarantine whole classes after exposure? Or has that changed too? Another big concern we face is a lack of personnel resources. It feels impossible sometimes even though we're doing everything possible and trying hard. When teachers were talking to me about wearing masks throughout class, then they expressed worries about how long they can sustain teaching jobs without burning themselves completely out. Maybe I'm the only person worried about this, but how we use staff also ties in. In terms of our actual staffing needs versus the number of positions currently filled and operational in each building. Some buildings seem better positioned and adequately staffed. However, there might be more opportunities for remote work and distance education"

    "content": "That was great feedback, Kate, thank you. My point wasn't solely dependent on receiving updates from state and federal authorities. Instead, I believe staying informed by reliable sources and working collaboratively with our healthcare partners keeps us grounded in facts. Agreeing with Katrina, relying on science helps guide our actions. With regard to quarantining entire classes, Graham Paige addressed that issue yesterday; our team discussed strategies for minimizing disruption, such as maintaining seating charts and identifying close contacts quickly. Addressing teacher burnout, an essential element amid our deliberation is ensuring educators' voices are heard and valued. They play a critical role in implementing policies effectively and deserve empathy, resources, and support. Perhaps we schedule another meeting with instructional staff representatives to gain deeper insight into these challenges before finalizing any adjustments. We also must maintain transparency and open communication channels throughout the academic year, recognizing these circumstances remain fluid. Does anybody have thoughts on how best to structure these check-ins and incorporate diverse perspectives moving forward?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "David, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the task force concept. Your emphasis on cultivating a culture of shared ownership and trust is particularly astute. To ensure the task force's effectiveness, it's essential to define its scope, roles, and responsibilities clearly. We should also establish transparent processes for reporting findings, proposing recommendations, and communicating with the broader school community. By doing so, we can guarantee accountability, inclusivity, and responsiveness to emerging issues. Furthermore, I suggest we consider designating a facilitator or chairperson to coordinate the task force's activities, synthesize inputs, and present summaries to our leadership teams."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Excellent suggestions, Judy! You've aptly highlighted the importance of clarity, transparency, and coordination within the task force. Establishing clear guidelines, roles, and expectations will indeed help streamline operations, promote collaboration, and yield actionable outcomes.

  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "As we deliberate over the details of a potential task force, let's make sure we factor in sufficient representation from marginalized communities whose voices may not always be at the table, yet disproportionately bear the brunt of systemic inequities during public crises like this one. By proactively engaging with them, we increase the likelihood of developing holistic, culturally sensitive responses to the pandemic's myriad challenges. Moreover, I'd encourage us to explore how our current district-level diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives intersect with our emergency management efforts and inform future iterations of both those frameworks. Ensuring such alignment strengthens our capacity for systemically just and equitable pandemic mitigation strategies. What steps do colleagues envision taking in terms of reaching beyond traditional advisory circles to coalesce viewpoints from underrepresented demographics within the larger school community?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, Kate, for emphasizing the need for intentional inclusivity and cultural sensitivity in our task force composition and emergency management approaches. To meaningfully engage with historically marginalized groups, we should consider partnering with local community organizations, faith leaders, and advocacy groups who have established relationships with these populations. We can also leverage existing diversity, equity, and inclusion committees within our schools to help identify and recruit representative voices. By doing so, we can ensure that our pandemic response is not only evidence-based but also culturally responsive and socially just."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Ellen, I wholeheartedly agree with your suggestions about strategic partnerships and leveraging internal DEI committees. Those collaborations will undoubtedly enrich our understanding of context-specific needs and foster more targeted supports. Another consideration might be hosting virtual town halls, focus groups, or listening sessions specifically designed for families from under-resourced backgrounds, people of color, indigenous individuals, or others historically excluded from mainstream planning processes. This direct outreach enables authentic exchange, dispels misconceptions, and encourages active participation in shaping decisions affecting their lives. How can we balance this grassroots engagement with maintaining institutional efficiency and expediency amidst the pandemic's fast-paced developments?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Excellent point, Kate. Balancing grassroots engagement with institutional efficiency requires intentional planning and prioritization. One strategy could be to designate specific task force members or working groups to focus on community outreach and engagement, while others concentrate on reviewing data, assessing policy implications, and refining protocols. By dividing tasks strategically, we can ensure that diverse voices are heard without sacrificing timely decision-making. Regular check-ins between these groups will facilitate knowledge sharing and integration of community feedback into our response strategies."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "That division-of-labor approach makes sense, Ellen. It acknowledges the criticality of both swift action and inclusive deliberation. Additionally, to further expedite information-sharing and cross-pollination between task force subgroups, I suggest establishing an accessible online platform where all relevant documents, meeting notes, and supporting resources are systematically stored and regularly updated. This centralized hub ensures everyone involved remains apprised of progress and can contribute efficiently to the development of a comprehensive pandemic response. How might we utilize technology to enhance the task force's functionality and overall productivity while preserving confidentiality when necessary?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Absolutely, Kate. An online platform would facilitate seamless collaboration and access to information. We can utilize secure, password-protected platforms like SharePoint or Google Workspace to store and manage documents, ensuring authorized personnel can access necessary materials while maintaining confidentiality. Additionally, we can leverage project management tools like Trello or Asana to track progress, assign tasks, and set deadlines, thereby streamlining workflows and promoting accountability. By thoughtfully selecting digital tools, we can strike a balance between transparency, accessibility, and confidentiality."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Ellen, you're spot-on regarding the value of technological solutions in enhancing task force efficacy. Implementing intuitive digital tools can certainly streamline communications, workflow management, and information dissemination. In tandem with these measures, I propose scheduling regular \"office hours\" for task force members to engage in informal Q&A sessions, address questions, or clarify concerns raised by students, staff, and parents. These drop-in opportunities promote transparency, build trust, and create space for real-time issue resolution. Shouldn't we also develop a dedicated webpage or dashboard providing easy-to-understand updates, data visualizations, and essential resources related to our pandemic response efforts?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Kate, I completely agree. The \"office hours\" concept fosters open communication channels, allowing us to respond promptly to stakeholder concerns and provide clarity around our pandemic response. And yes, creating a dedicated webpage or dashboard is crucial for centralizing information, tracking progress, and showcasing our commitment to transparency. This resource can feature up-to-date case rates, safety protocols, FAQs, and other vital information, empowering our community to stay informed and make data-driven decisions. By making complex information easily digestible, we demonstrate our dedication to accountability and community-centered decision-making."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Exactly, Ellen! Our dashboard should serve as a go-to source for accurate, actionable information. To amplify its impact, let's embed opportunities for user feedback, enabling visitors to submit questions, comments, or concerns directly through the site. This feedback loop empowers us to iteratively refine our response based on community input, fostering a culture of continuous improvement. Furthermore, it's essential to prioritize language accessibility by including translations and clear visuals, thus ensuring that all stakeholders \u2013 regardless of linguistic proficiency or ability \u2013 can engage with and benefit from the provided information. Who else thinks it wise to incorporate metrics on dashboard usage and community engagement to gauge effectiveness and guide refinements?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Colleagues, I concur that our communication strategy must emphasize transparency, inclusivity, and ease of use. Incorporating user feedback mechanisms and multilingual support into the dashboard is absolutely vital. Moreover, monitoring dashboard analytics and community engagement metrics allows us to fine-tune our messaging, adjust content delivery methods, and better meet community needs over time. In order to maximize buy-in, I recommend presenting the new dashboard during upcoming parent-teacher conferences or PTA meetings. This face-to-face launch facilitates interactive demonstrations, live Q&A, and immediate assistance, ultimately increasing familiarity and comfort with the tool among key stakeholders. By introducing the dashboard via these trusted community touchpoints, we establish credibility, generate buzz, and encourage widespread adoption.  Does anyone foresee any potential challenges or logistical hurdles associated with integrating user feedback and metric analysis into the proposed dashboard design?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I think Jonno has astutely captured the benefits of incorporating user feedback and multilingual support within the dashboard. To proactively address potential obstacles, I suggest identifying a small team responsible for moderating submitted feedback, addressing emergent issues, and reporting trends back to the task force. This designated group should possess cultural competency, empathy, and crisis communication training to handle sensitive inquiries effectively. Additionally, setting clear expectations around response timelines, format preferences (e.g., email vs. phone calls), and escalation procedures will help manage constituent expectations and maintain transparency throughout the process. Finally, it's imperative we plan ahead for scenario-based contingency planning exercises to ensure seamless dashboard operations even if faced with unexpected events or disruptions. Have colleagues considered how to operationalize equity-focused considerations when examining user engagement patterns and feedback submissions? Are there established safeguards against inadvertently perpetuating existing disparities within our community through these emerging systems? Davidoberg and Graham Page have expertise here; perhaps they can weigh in on those matters. Would that not add some dimensionality to the discussion at hand?  Thank you so much."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thank you, Katrina, for your thoughtful consideration of equity-focused implications. Indeed, we must acknowledge and mitigate potential biases in user engagement analysis. One possible solution involves applying an intersectional lens to examine engagement patterns across different demographics, ensuring that underrepresented voices receive equal attention. By proactively identifying disparities and developing targeted strategies, we can work towards more equitable outcomes. For instance, we could explore collaborations with community organizations serving historically marginalized groups to gather their insights and involve them in the co-design of our pandemic response. This participatory approach helps guarantee that diverse perspectives inform our decision-making processes. Graham, would you like to expand upon my thoughts and share his own ideas on how best to integrate equity considerations throughout our task force endeavors?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Of course, David. Equity indeed remains top of mind as we consider stakeholder interactions and dashboard utilization patterns. I wholeheartedly endorse the notion of adopting an intersectional framework to identify disparate impacts and implement countermeasures aimed at achieving greater parity. I do worry about potentially reifying historical power dynamics within our community unless deliberate steps are taken to elevate and center the voices most susceptible to exclusionary practices. What strikes me most deeply is the prospect of collaboration with local advocacy entities, such as the Latinx Education Coalition or NAACP Albemarle Branch. Cultivating these partnerships enables authentic representation and bolsters both the relevance and responsiveness of our services. By inviting impacted individuals to drive innovation, we stand a far greater chance of producing solutions meeting their specific needs, mitigating unintentionally negative consequences, and further solidifying the social compact which binds our county together. Could others see merits to establishing such coalitions and what roles do they envision them playing going forward?  If I might ask that question. Thank you very much.  Yes. Okay. All right. Thank you, Ms. Osborne. You may proceed with Mr. Alcaro next. Then Dr. Acuff and then Mr. Oberg. Right after him, Dr. Page,  you can comment. We've got all evening. Take your time. Thank you. I'm sorry. Go ahead, Mr. Alcaro. Yeah. Go ahead. OK. Great. Thanks, Mr. Page. My last point was simply the importance of making sure that if we're trying to look out for one another, we need to be aware of the situations in our buildings where kids might not have access to technology, either because they don't have devices or they don't have connectivity. So, however we move forward with dashboards or whatever we call them, please keep in mind that we still have students who lack internet access. Or we did two months ago. It could have changed since. But just bear that in mind. So thanks. Dr. Kaufman. Mr. Delorio. No.  That's alright.  Dr. Acuff. Go ahead. Did we get what you needed? Yeah, thank you.  All right. Do you have anything else you want to say? Is there anything we can do differently than we were doing originally that you'd like to bring forth? OK.  Thank you, Kate.  Dave? David Oberg. So I am so glad that Dr"
