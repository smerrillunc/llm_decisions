Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.1: COVID Mask Policy - The board will discuss the district\u2019s COVID-19 health protocols, specifically whether students should be required to wear masks while in classrooms. This policy would apply during the regular school day, with exceptions for lunch and designated mask-break periods. The goal is to balance student safety with comfort and learning effectiveness.. Who would like to start?"

So if you could give us an update on that perspective from them about where they stand now relative to last year, what they're recommending. And then after we hear that information, I do have a series of questions myself around both implementation strategies and also some of my own concerns about how it would work inside buildings. Thank you."

    "content": "Dr. Haas has been doing outstanding work staying connected with Albemarle County Public Health leaders. I know we had discussions in June about keeping all of those things up-to-date when it comes to mitigation measures. As far as the current state of affairs right now, we were at a relatively good place, given the time of year. But Dr. Burgert just reached out to me today saying that cases are starting to trend upward more quickly than before. He did not recommend mandating but definitely highly recommended continuing encouraging universal masking through August at least until mid-month, and then reassessing depending on conditions. That matches CDC guidelines too. They suggest wearing face coverings indoors, regardless of vaccination status, and especially with people who may have compromised immune systems and unvaccinated individuals, such as younger children. To date, their advice continues to support layering prevention methods for maximum protection. Is there anything else I can provide based upon our conversations with them?\n```>NNXitekatrinaacallan\nkateacuff: Yes, so just a point of clarification. In that communication from the doctor, was that the same position he took back in May as well? Was his recommendation different back then compared to now? Or was it essentially consistent?\n```\nI think that will really help inform our thinking going forward. If nothing has changed, why might we consider changing something when cases are lower than they were when we decided that decision made sense. I'm still grappling with how the science supports requiring versus strongly recommending at this point. How did his guidance come down differently between May and July? I think that may make a big difference.   Okay. And then Dr., thank you. Just in terms of consistency across schools, we could certainly use a universal set of criteria to assess the appropriateness of any sort of mandate. And by the way, my question remains the same whether that be in the school setting or outside. What types of data points have guided your decisions thus far? Have those data points shifted since springtime? One thing I wonder is about how we would even measure success and potential impact of such a decision. I realize there are challenges to isolating variables here, and it gets complex quite quickly. Are there studies pointing to mask mandates being tied into improved outcomes that I might read later tonight?. Thank you very much.  I guess my biggest concern really falls under the heading of kids falling behind due to masks over an extended period. My youngest child"

    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thanks, Kate. Thank you for bringing that up. We've talked a lot about access and equity within our community. If we require masks universally, are we unintentionally creating barriers to education for certain groups of students whose families lack access to disposable masks, washing facilities, etc.? Would some students be stigmatized or penalized if they didn't have access to clean, reliable masks? So I believe we need to address accessibility and logistics upfront. It feels difficult for me to reconcile a strict requirement without considering those unintended consequences. I understand the importance of mitigation measures, but it feels essential to weigh this against some other considerations. What kind of assistance does ACPS offer or plan to offer to ensure equitable access to quality PPE? Could you speak to that, please? \n```\ndavidoberg:  Thank you Katrina, I agree completely. Also wanted to say thanks for asking that clarifying question. That makes it clear the situation hasn't changed appreciably between May and now. If it was deemed non-necessary back in the spring, isn't it reasonable to ask why it seems necessary now when we haven't seen that significant shift? I see a disconnect. I worry about teaching students with masks, reading facial cues. I don't want to minimize COVID risk; however, it appears that the data doesn't support making kids wear masks constantly. We don't seem to know what metric will show this measure has been effective. For instance, which key performance indicator demonstrates the link between no transmission spread in schools, whatever we define that as? There must be KPIs somewhere. I couldn't find them. Lastly, Graham said a little earlier that one challenge we'll always struggle with is we won't ever fully isolate every variable. When you look at this type of action taken historically, is there anywhere where there's evidence that shows we truly know the root cause of that outcome? For example, are there areas of study that conclude conclusively that masking works? Or are these recommendations largely anecdotal, trying to model human behavior? I hope someone knows of research studies that show causality or correlation. Because if they exist, they aren't super apparent. Those would inform this significantly. I value peer-reviewed articles from respected medical journals because of their rigor and thoroughness. Do these sources validate these interventions unequivocally?\n```"

    "content": "Dave, thank you for sharing.  Thank you for asking about that data. The most recent case information and statistics shared yesterday were also shared with the Board by Dr. Haas, so you should receive them via email. Today during our last phone call, Dr. Burger suggested maintaining our close partnership. Our next conference call with him is scheduled next week, so that gives us another chance to continue getting updates.  You asked about the data point to guide decisions. If I recall correctly, the goal was never zero transmissions in schools. However, you're correct to expect some level of quantitative indicators of effectiveness. We'd like to discuss further, including working together to create the ones needed moving forward, potentially engaging external experts in epidemiology.  That's important. This morning I was reminded of our commitment to mitigating learning loss while prioritizing health safety. Both aspects go hand-in-hand. A balance exists, which I recognize sometimes shifts according to context. Let's focus first on aligning expectations among both local health officials and schools system leaders in understanding their roles in supporting public health policy goals. If necessary, they can assist in providing direct support. From there, we develop measurable targets tracking progress toward objectives aligned with ACPS\u2019s vision mission statement values, focusing on all parts of student growth and development. Then perhaps what's left is evaluating what specific numbers tie best to these goals. Once we have agreement around those indicators, we evaluate the effectiveness of each intervention relative to its contribution to those metrics.  Perhaps some of our existing social-emotional wellness metrics serve as leading indicators because the pandemic exacerbates mental wellbeing challenges. Another thought was the relationship of chronic absenteeism to academic achievement. So many factors play into both metrics. I propose we keep digging deeper in order to establish causal links among these outcomes and interventions if that's possible. Finally, looking beyond this particular issue, that could lead us to developing tools better suited for monitoring these important issues post-pandemic.\n```"

    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thank you, Graham. Your suggestions make sense. Establishing quantifiable metrics and agreeing upon the desired outcomes are crucial steps. I'm intrigued by incorporating our social-emotional wellness metrics as leading indicators, given the profound impact of this crisis on students' mental health. In addition, exploring correlations between chronic absenteeism and academic achievement is vital. I do concur that delving deeper may uncover valuable insights. As we move forward, let's not lose sight of our commitment to fairness and equity, ensuring that any implemented strategies benefit all students, particularly our most vulnerable populations. How can we guarantee equal access to resources and support systems, thereby avoiding unintended consequences, as Katrina highlighted?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thank you, David. I appreciate your emphasis on equity and fairness. To build on Katrina's concern, I think it's essential we consider the potential disproportionate impact of mask-wearing requirements on marginalized communities. Access to quality masks, laundry facilities, and hygiene practices might vary greatly across our district. Ensuring equal access to resources and accommodations is critical. One possibility could be partnering with local organizations to provide free or low-cost masks, laundry services, or educational materials on proper hygiene practices. Additionally, we could explore alternatives to traditional masks, such as reusable cloth masks or face shields, which might be more accessible to some families. By doing so, we can mitigate potential barriers to education and promote inclusivity."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thanks Judy for emphasizing again how equity concerns underpin everything. It is a thread throughout everything. And Katrina, Judy just echoed that part of your request.  Before hearing ideas on resource allocation or logistics, though, since there appear to be questions about whether the data supports this requirement, could someone summarize or refresh everyone's memory on what current scientific consensus holds regarding the role of masks in preventing disease transmission within school settings, along with related peer-reviewed literature? To help frame this decision, I'd love clarity about the extent to which wearing masks correlates to infection rates and transmission risks. With accurate information available, then we'll feel comfortable discussing ways to address those gaps in access Judy identified, or weighing alternative approaches and their feasibility. If necessary, do we need to bring experts here or consult the Department of Education on what other districts are implementing successfully?  What have others learned through this journey already?  I assume even anecdotally that people here remember various things heard over time about different attempts made. Does anyone happen to recall instances elsewhere involving, for example, teachers struggling to read facial expressions due to masks, and what educators did to respond effectively to these difficulties?  The real-world experiences from diverse perspectives could add richness to our considerations before we land on anything locally."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Kate, I completely agree that clarifying the scientific consensus on mask-wearing in schools is essential to informing our decision-making process. According to the CDC and WHO, numerous peer-reviewed studies demonstrate that mask-wearing significantly reduces the transmission of respiratory viruses, including COVID-19, in community and healthcare settings. Specifically, a study published in The Lancet found that mask-wearing reduced transmission risk by 70% in households. While there may be limitations and variations in individual studies, the overwhelming evidence suggests that masks are an effective tool in reducing transmission when combined with other mitigation measures."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thanks Ellen for refreshing everyone on the scientific foundation. That's helpful to confirm where the preponderance of research stands currently. Given this established link between mask-wearing and transmission reduction, my mind turns now to implementation and enforcement details. For instance, would we opt for universal masking mandates, or rely more heavily on personal responsibility and parental discretion? How will staff ensure compliance without overly burdening themselves or stigmatizing non-compliant students unintentionally? Jonnoalcaro mentioned earlier that some teachers expressed concerns about policing mask usage during instruction; it seems we should acknowledge these legitimate practicalities upfront. Any thoughts on balancing vigilance against instructional priorities, or even creative solutions teachers could employ to normalize mask use within classroom environments? And finally, in tandem with implementing mask policies, are there accompanying conversations happening around upgrading ventilation infrastructure in older buildings, or improving air purification methods generally to supplement mask-wearing efforts? Those physical environmental changes strike me as another layer to examine closely alongside human behavioral adaptations."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Many thanks, Kate. Yes, it is indeed vital that we discuss implementation specifics. Concerns raised by educators underscore the importance of finding an approach that balances vigilance with instructional responsibilities. We must ensure that mask enforcement doesn't inadvertently create additional burdens or stigmas. Here's one strategy worth considering: Educators could incorporate mask-wearing into daily routines like handwashing and taking attendance, thus normalizing the practice while minimizing disruptions. Also, using age-appropriate messaging and visual reminders could reinforce responsible behavior. To tackle concerns about building ventilation, yes, we're concurrently reviewing options to upgrade our HVAC systems, especially in older facilities, to improve indoor air quality further. This multi-pronged strategy acknowledges the interplay between personal actions, environmental conditions, and overall safety. Now that we've outlined key areas requiring consideration, I suggest we reconvene next week after gathering additional input from stakeholders, educators, and departmental teams on both resource accessibility and implementation logistics. Let's also invite Dr. Patel from our county health department to share lessons learned and advice on enforcing mask mandates effectively, should they become necessary. Does that sound reasonable to everyone?\n```"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Absolutely, Jonno, your suggested approach strikes a great balance between normalization and minimization of disruption. Incorporating mask-wearing into daily routines and utilizing visual reminders can indeed foster a sense of collective responsibility among students. I'm glad you're exploring upgrades to our HVAC systems, which will undoubtedly complement our mask policy. Your proposal to gather further stakeholder input and invite Dr. Patel to share expertise sounds like a prudent step forward. In preparation for our next meeting, let's distribute a concise summary of today's discussion, highlighting action items and tasks assigned to each team member. Shall we set a deadline for feedback collection and review prior to our reconvened session, ensuring everyone remains informed and aligned throughout this collaborative process?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Agreed David.  Thank you for supporting the idea of incorporating mask-wearing into daily routines. Katrina, would you kindly compile a concise summary of our discussion today, outlining action items, task assignments, and deadlines for feedback submission? Once finalized, please disseminate this document to all members ahead of our next meeting, allowing ample time for review and reflection. As part of the prep work, I'll reach out to Dr. Patel to secure her availability for our subsequent session, as well as explore any relevant insights gleaned from peer district implementations. With such collaboration and diligence, we can develop a comprehensive plan grounded in science, equity, and our shared commitment to student wellbeing."

    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thank you, Jonno, for encapsulating our progress so far. I appreciate the attention given to addressing potential issues of stigma and educator workload. It's crucial that we prioritize both equity and efficacy in our approach. As we move forward, I'd like us to keep two critical aspects top-of-mind: firstly, how we support vulnerable populations, such as immunocompromised students, who might require additional accommodations; secondly, how we can harness opportunities for community engagement and education beyond school walls. By doing so, we can cultivate a culture of mutual understanding, empathy, and shared accountability that truly benefits everyone involved."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Judy, thank you for underscoring those vital points. Indeed, our mask policy should thoughtfully consider vulnerable student populations, and we'll need to explore targeted support mechanisms. Additionally, engaging the broader community and fostering a spirit of collective ownership will prove instrumental in maximizing effectiveness. I propose we establish a small working group focused specifically on developing culturally responsive communications strategies and resources for outreach. Graham, would you lead this effort, drawing upon your experience with family and community partnerships? Please identify volunteers interested in contributing their expertise to this important initiative. By empowering families, local organizations, and community leaders as allies, we can weave together a rich tapestry of support that complements our in-school initiatives."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thanks, Jonno, Judy, and others. I completely agree with Judy's emphasis on keeping vulnerable populations at the forefront of our decision-making.  Implementing effective support structures for immunocompromised students and others may necessitate close consultation with healthcare experts, special ed professionals, and affected families. The proposed working group for culturally responsive communication strategies resonates deeply with me, too. Graham, if I might add, could this subgroup focus not only on external messaging but also internal awareness-building activities targeting our own educators, thereby creating a more empathetic and unified front in terms of inclusive practices and trauma-sensitive approaches? Lastly, since data-informed decision making underlies much of what we do here, has anyone begun exploring ways to monitor, measure, and analyze the impact of our eventual mask policy vis-a-vis case rates, learning outcomes, teacher capacity, and other performance metrics \u2013 essentially setting ourselves up for continuous assessment and refinement based on emerging trends and findings over time?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Excellent suggestions, Kate. I wholeheartedly endorse integrating internal awareness-building activities within the working group's scope to ensure educators feel equipped to provide supportive environments for all students. Regarding monitoring and evaluation, I concur that establishing a robust framework for tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) is essential. This will enable us to refine our policies, make evidence-driven decisions, and optimize our response to evolving circumstances. I recommend we task a separate subcommittee to oversee this aspect, comprising representatives from our research, analytics, and academic affairs departments. Their primary objective will be to design a comprehensive dashboard capturing relevant metrics, facilitating regular progress assessments, and informing future adjustments to our mask policy and broader COVID-19 mitigation strategies."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "That's an excellent idea, Ellen! Establishing a dedicated committee responsible for designing a metric-rich dashboard will empower us with actionable insights into policy effectiveness and allow for timely course corrections when needed. Could that subcommittee also consult with teachers, staff, and administrators across different schools to better understand specific pain points and identify opportunities where existing processes might need streamlining or adaptation? Moreover, as part of our ongoing risk assessment efforts, shall we simultaneously explore methods for regularly surveying student attitudes toward wearing masks and gauging general sentiment around our chosen strategies? By marrying quantitative KPIs with qualitative perspectives, we stand to gain a richer comprehension of our policy's operational footprint."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Absolutely, Kate. Incorporating diverse stakeholders' voices through surveys and focus groups will help us capture nuances and contextual factors influencing policy implementation. Our subcommittee should indeed engage with teachers, staff, and administrators to gather valuable ground-level insights, identifying areas for improvement and opportunities for synergy. Furthermore, conducting regular student attitude surveys will provide critical information on perceived barriers, concerns, and motivators related to mask-wearing, enabling us to fine-tune our approach and address potential issues proactively. By triangulating these qualitative findings with quantitative metrics, we'll foster a more holistic understanding of our policy's impact and inform data-driven refinements."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Agreed, Ellen. I think we're really building something meaningful here. To supplement these efforts, it might be beneficial to invite some mental health professionals onto the subcommittee, considering their insight into anxiety, stressors, and overall wellbeing surrounding mask mandates. What are your thoughts on including some outside expertise, perhaps even partnering with local universities or public health institutions to augment our team's knowledge base and stay current with cutting-edge research? In parallel, how about asking David Oberg to connect with state and national educational associations to collate best-practice recommendations and lessons learned from comparable districts grappling with similar challenges? We can certainly benefit from borrowing successful ideas and avoiding unnecessary pitfalls along the way."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Kate, I couldn't agree more regarding incorporating mental health professionals into our subcommittee and seeking external collaborations to enhance our understanding. The emotional toll of prolonged pandemic measures mustn't be overlooked, particularly among vulnerable populations. Engaging local university partners or reputable organizations specializing in adolescent mental health could offer invaluable guidance. Additionally, reaching out to peer districts via David's connections with state and national associations will undoubtedly yield practical wisdom. Graham, would you kindly facilitate an introduction between David and those entities to expedite this process?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Thank you so much, Jonno. Yes, it sounds like we have consensus on both fronts. And I'm glad you mentioned the emotional toll that long-term pandemic measures could take.  As superintendent, nothing is more important than the well-being and success of each and every one of our students. So, yes, I'd be happy to work with David to reach out to his contacts and get that ball rolling. And by the same token, I think we would do well to formalize our partnership with our school board's advisory committees on diversity and inclusion, which would bring additional parent, teacher, and community voice to bear on this discussion. Finally, before I forget, Judy Le asked that we keep her apprised of any discussions on exceptions or accommodations. Should we schedule a follow-up meeting for Friday afternoon to delve deeper into those topics and discuss preliminary findings from these new subcommittees?\n```"

It's crucial we prioritize student wellbeing while navigating this complex issue. I'll promptly reach out to my contacts at state and national educational associations to gather valuable insights from peers who've tackled similar challenges. Looking ahead, I propose we dedicate a portion of our next meeting to discussing exceptions and accommodations, ensuring we're addressing the unique needs of all students. Let's plan to reconvene on Friday afternoon, as suggested, to review initial findings and forge a path forward together."

It's essential that we proactively consider the implications of mask policies on our most vulnerable students and families. Through inclusive planning, we'll create an environment where everyone feels supported and valued. To further emphasize our commitment to equity and accessibility, let's also task the subcommittee exploring mask efficacy to examine available literature on adaptive face coverings designed specifically for individuals with disabilities. By taking a multifaceted approach, we can minimize unintended consequences and optimize our response to the pandemic. Shall we aim to finalize the questionnaire by Wednesday and distribute it to relevant stakeholders, giving them ample time to respond before our Friday meeting?"
