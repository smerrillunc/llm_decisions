    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.1: COVID Mask Policy - The board will discuss the district\u2019s COVID-19 health protocols, specifically whether students should be required to wear masks while in classrooms. This policy would apply during the regular school day, with exceptions for lunch and designated mask-break periods. The goal is to balance student safety with comfort and learning effectiveness.. Who would like to start?"

    "content": "I appreciate our attention to all aspects of these considerations.  So as we dive into today's agenda and discussion, may I suggest  Dr. Oberg could perhaps provide more information regarding COVID case rates and the risks associated with different settings, to better guide our thinking about this decision? And if possible, any updated insights on masking and the most vulnerable populations within the district population.  Additionally, it might help to hear input from our student body directly, since their perspectives can often highlight key factors in implementation that we might have overlooked.  So I think having an idea of how we stand currently and then some insights from Dr. Oberg and our students are two essential steps forward here. Would that sound right? Or are there other thoughts to start off with? Thank you so much for bringing this item back up again for review. And let me simply say one thing: I know each and every one of us has been really considering this, and all of that thoughtfulness is important, whether we agree fully at the end of the day or not. It certainly helps the district make a much better choice when we truly engage collectively. With that said, my thought would be Dr. Oberg should speak first. We've had an opportunity to digest the data, but we want him to clarify what some of those statistics show. After hearing from Dr. Oberg and having his full perspective, then, I would say the board needs an overview of exactly what we have right now regarding policies in comparison to what we're talking about implementing differently if we go down certain paths. From that point, then we could weigh pros and cons because at present, we can see multiple options which seem good. But, I think they require our ability to consider those trade-offs against the requirements related to each option. So yes, that makes sense because you could easily argue both sides if you wanted to look at some sort of threshold and after hitting it, do something drastically. If anything else gets added beyond that point, even further measures, you could easily imagine this being pushed way too far. Therefore I feel that, ultimately what's most relevant is ensuring the kids don't become uncomfortable to where their academic work drops a lot, so there needs to be sensitivity to that aspect also. So I feel strongly. All of these pieces just feel very significant to this matter for us. It will take time. Thank you.  Ellen, would you like to open it up to the board members for additional comments following Dr"

    "content": "Absolutely, Jonno, thank you for your thoughtful suggestions. Dr. Oberg, please do share the current COVID case rates and risk assessment data to inform our discussion. It's crucial we base our decisions on evidence. Following that, I'd like to hear from Katrina, who has been working closely with our student representatives, to gather their feedback and concerns on this matter. By understanding their perspectives, we can ensure our policy is effective and considerate of their experiences. Then, we can open the floor to the rest of the board members for questions and comments."

    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Sure. Dr. Oberg, to get started I believe you were supposed to give out some context based upon the information I was provided last week. Could we start there?  My concern going forward would be that we did have a small committee of students who were actively involved in our early days at planning last year. Those students didn't return due to graduation. While we had wonderful new kids come on board in the fall to fill those roles, many are still trying to adjust to the high school experience right now. So by involving them today, in my belief, I know I sent several messages asking the board if that feels like it's accurate, and we actually reached our last couple students who stepped forward yesterday. We received responses indicating quite a bit of interest but just needing more structure support in that communication process before they could contribute. So yes, this could indeed be important and something helpful for student wellbeing and even just knowing what this committee looks like going forward.  So I'll be interested in Dr. Oberg's updates on data from the community in terms of total cases per capita compared to what schools and student age populations were seeing previously, what's happening locally. In addition, I wonder what differences he sees between now and what led to earlier recommendations of requiring the masks.  If there are huge disparities in that context where things have improved significantly, it bears consideration. Dr. Page mentioned that while it seems as though there isn't universal agreement at some points, overall our district continues to remain committed to the highest level of safety for our students and staff alike. What is the real status and why now would no longer need face coverings. That's part of the context that would be a big player.  To get started, Dr. Oberg, could you offer context around our local cases and what you believe leads you to recommend that, given some changes over time and improvements compared to earlier years' statistics? Thank you, Ellen.  Kate and David?"

    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Yes, thank you, Ellen, and Katrina. I appreciate the thorough discussion thus far. Indeed, understanding the current landscape is vital. As you requested, I'd like to provide an update on our local COVID case rates and risk assessments. Based on recent data from the county health department, our district's transmission rate remains relatively low compared to previous surges, with a downward trend evident. However, it's crucial to acknowledge that we still have pockets of vulnerability among our student population, particularly those with compromised immune systems. Considering the effectiveness of mask-wearing in mitigating the spread, I'd like to emphasize its continued importance, especially within close quarters like classrooms. Next, I'd be happy to delve into specific figures, highlighting areas where we've seen improvement and discuss potential relaxation strategies for mask mandates. Additionally, I concur with Katrina's sentiment regarding the valuable input from our student body; their voices must be heard in shaping this decision. Shall I proceed with presenting the current data and risk assessments, followed by an exploration of student perspectives?"

    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thank you, Dr. Oberg, for providing this critical context. Given the ongoing downward trend in transmission rates, I'm curious to explore how we might balance this progress with the imperative to protect vulnerable populations. I completely agree that mask-wearing remains essential in mitigating the spread, particularly in classroom settings. Before proceeding, may I suggest we review our district's existing policies and protocols alongside the proposed adjustments to better understand the implications of any changes? This would enable us to make data-driven decisions that prioritize both student safety and comfort. Additionally, I endorse the importance of incorporating student voices in this process and perhaps even exploring innovative ways to engage them moving forward. Let's take a closer look at the numbers, weighing the trade-offs and considering multiple scenarios before making a final determination."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Judy, I couldn't agree more. Your suggestion to review our existing policies and protocols is prudent, allowing us to assess the efficacy of our current approach and identify opportunities for refinement. By doing so, we can thoughtfully weigh the benefits of relaxed mask mandates against the ongoing risks, ensuring that any adjustments align with our commitment to student safety and well-being. Incorporating student perspectives will undoubtedly enrich our decision-making process. I propose we task our administrative team with conducting a thorough review of our current policies, including consultation with our medical advisors, and present findings at our next meeting. This will enable us to have a more informed discussion about potential modifications, should they be deemed necessary. Kate, would you like to add anything to this proposal or offer your thoughts on the balance between student safety and comfort?"

    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I think the direction you're heading, David, is spot-on. Reviewing our existing policies, protocols, and data allows us to be responsive yet responsible in our approach to mask mandates. It's essential to keep our students' needs at the forefront, particularly those with compromised immune systems, and ensure we're considering the full range of factors impacting their health and academic success. As we move forward, let's not only incorporate student voices but also continue engaging with local health experts and staying informed about regional developments. With a comprehensive, data-driven analysis in hand, we'll be well-positioned to make an informed decision that addresses these competing priorities effectively."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thank you, Kate. I appreciate your emphasis on maintaining a student-centered approach and consulting with local health experts. Your point about staying informed about regional developments is well-taken, as it's crucial we stay adaptable and responsive to changing circumstances. By taking a holistic view, we can develop a nuanced understanding of the interplay between mask mandates, student well-being, and academic success. Graham, would you like to share your thoughts on how we can best balance individual freedoms with collective responsibility in this context, particularly when it comes to implementing and enforcing mask policies?"

  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Thanks, Dave.  All right. Well, I don't know if this would help, but I was thinking about Katrina's suggestions on focusing on, you know, who and where and how and then maybe what it's been since September, and then this week, maybe in the coming weeks to be able to, one, give people notice and two, to give, again, as Katrina said, to focus on certain times of day or places where the transmission is higher. It gives me pause that, you know, for some reason or another, we had a lot less kids absent last year during COVID than this year. And I'm wondering whether or not that was because they were masked, which may have cut back on other illnesses, along with cutting down on COVID.  If we do decide to lift the mandate, I think that ought to be considered carefully. Is my thinking sound? Does that kind of make sense?  One other thing that I didn't mention, too, is it's one thing when our number goes up or down based on community transmission, but when does it rise for the school? Like, how do we measure those instances, you know, really measuring the impact of school or outside of school where most of our positive transmissions come from, so that we really have a clear understanding of when to put it in place and when to take it off? That would help me to support that.  So, like, it would be helpful if I knew, you know, how many were out sick during COVID and how many are out this year. I just think there are still lots and lots of questions, and I totally am supporting this group effort. Just trying to be open-minded but concerned for every aspect of it. I appreciate what Judy said. We're never going to please everyone. But, you know, I think that in that same way that we've operated so collaboratively for these past three years, we could use something similar here.  And I mean, Judy, you brought up about reviewing those protocols. Are we saying that they need any adjustment? And I totally agree. And we do have room for student voice at various steps of our student leadership committees. We can reach out directly to them, because sometimes, you know, we talk to adults in charge, but actually talking to the young people themselves, we probably should do that. So I apologize for being a little lengthy. I think I did my first time ever, so thank"

  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Graham, no need to apologize; your input is valuable and welcome. You raise excellent points regarding the significance of examining our absentee rates pre-COVID compared to post-COVID. By studying these trends, we may uncover correlations between mask-wearing and reduced illness overall. Furthermore, tracking instances of transmission within schools versus external sources will indeed help guide our policy decisions. I completely concur on the importance of seeking student perspectives through our established leadership channels and potentially direct outreach efforts. In terms of reviewing our protocols, yes, I believe now is an opportune time to revisit and refine them to ensure they remain effective and relevant in today's context. Jonnoalcaro, would you care to comment on how we can ensure equitable access to masks for all students and staff members, should we maintain or adapt our mask mandate?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Yes. Kate, I appreciate you bringing that up. Indeed, equity must underpin any decision we make. Accessibility is key, so that everyone has equal access to reliable masks that fit properly. That means providing resources to procure quality masks, plus education on proper usage. Further to your point about reviewing protocols, we need to consider additional measures such as targeted professional development, monitoring usage, and addressing non-compliance. Perhaps a tiered system with increased supports and guidelines could address varying learning environments and age groups, thereby ensuring consistency across the district while allowing for flexibility where needed. Ultimately, fairness and inclusivity should guide each step we take. What are people's thoughts on having an ad hoc committee comprised of teachers, administrators, and representatives from our maintenance teams to collaborate on the operational aspects of mask implementation or adaptation?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Great suggestion, Jonno! An ad hoc committee would bring diverse expertise to the table, ensuring a comprehensive approach to mask implementation or adaptation. I'd recommend including student representation as well, to provide their unique perspective on accessibility and feasibility. Additionally, we should consider involving local health experts to provide guidance on optimal mask usage and mitigation strategies. This collaborative effort would allow us to develop a robust plan that balances individual needs with collective responsibility."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "I couldn't agree more, Ellen. Having local health experts involved is crucial for ensuring our decisions align with the latest scientific evidence. I also appreciate your point about incorporating student representation, keeping in mind that they'll ultimately be responsible for executing our mask-related plans. That adds another layer of practicality and buy-in to our strategy. Moving forward, it might be worthwhile to identify potential members for the ad hoc committee, while simultaneously considering strategies to engage broader stakeholder groups throughout the process. Perhaps setting up smaller working subgroups focused on specific areas, such as communication, logistics, or educational resources, could facilitate that engagement effectively. What do people think about establishing a transparent timeline for our decision-making and action, accompanied by regular updates to keep everyone informed and aligned throughout the process?  Would that provide greater clarity and confidence in our path forward?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thank you both very much. One follow-up question on communication around equity considerations for mask accessibility: We definitely want to guarantee every family or learner who needs financial assistance receives it. The schools themselves are a vital point of contact for distributing resources. Perhaps it makes sense for principals, then, to set up clear procedures, maybe even a small allocation specifically earmarked for purchasing masks and giving to families who cannot afford to purchase those masks themselves. Shouldn't this be addressed before or along with creating protocols for our return-to-classroom strategy?  I also agree that establishing realistic timelines will reassure families they don't need to guess when they'll hear from us again. They can stay updated about ongoing changes and expectations, knowing exactly where we are relative to our target deadlines. This transparency keeps us accountable and allows for better collaboration between teachers, parents, and learners alike. That being said, let's move toward developing that committee structure. Do we need to vote on the formal proposal tonight or can we move ahead after finalizing details at a following board meeting?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thanks, Katrina. Your suggestions echo concerns about making sure our solutions consider the needs of our most vulnerable populations. Principals identifying resources to support mask accessibility sounds like a great idea. As for forming the ad hoc committee, I propose we move ahead with structuring it and outline its tasks without needing a formal vote tonight. Once details are refined, we can revisit the committee formation during our next meeting for approval. This approach should give us enough time to gather further input and feedback from stakeholders before solidifying our plans. Does that sound reasonable to everyone? And Jonno, I appreciate your suggestion of breaking down larger tasks into smaller focus areas \u2013 we could include communication and resource allocation among those."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Absolutely, David. Breaking down responsibilities into actionable workstreams not only streamlines the process but makes it easier to assign ownership, track progress, and ensure a cohesive outcome. I second David's motion to delay formal approval until next week, contingent on us refining the scope, goals, and member composition of the ad hoc committee in advance. Given the complexity of our task list, maintaining open lines of communication, especially regarding mask accessibility for financially strained families, takes priority. It bears repeating that our goal is not merely compliance, but a well-designed solution founded upon fairness, equity, and sound scientific research."
