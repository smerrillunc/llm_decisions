Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.4: Student Code of Conduct - The board will review proposed updates to the district\u2019s Student Code of Conduct, which outlines behavioral expectations and disciplinary procedures. Key changes include new rules around cell phone usage during instructional time, updates to the dress code to reflect inclusivity and professionalism, and revisions to disciplinary consequences to promote restorative practices.. Who would like to start?"

    "content": "I'd like to introduce our first speaker, Ms. Smith. She's been an instrumental part of the task force formed to revise the code. Ms. Smith? Would you please walk us through these critical and much-needed updates. We've got quite a few parents, students, teachers, and community members in attendance who are eager to understand these important changes better. Could we get your insights and hear some specific examples, too?\n```ssiurcgraamre: Thank you very much to my colleagues at the board table and Dr. Doering. Thank you also to Mr. Roderick, Ms. Walker, Mr. Trenor, our principals, vice-principals, teacher leaders, administrators, school resource officers, and staff members working on the Task Force on School Safety. We had several other stakeholders that were involved: parents, students, teachers, the NAACP parent council, the Latinx group called ELITE, and our disability organizations participated as well.  Ms. Odom, one of our high school parents said what really resonated with me is that the code should be focused on equity and restoration rather than punishment. She stated that it was time to stop focusing on punishment and focus on positive reinforcement of desirable behaviors. Here's what we did. First, we made major improvements to the organization. So I know in previous years, if you opened up the code of conduct, you looked through maybe a list of a hundred behaviors, 50 infractions, whatever, organized sometimes in a confusing way. When you open it now, it starts by outlining the district's vision, its commitment to student success, equality and excellence. Then you see four core principles that guide everything else: respect, empathy, responsibility, and growth mindset.  From there we move into expectations, which fall under eight categories that align directly with the American School Counselor Association's framework, that address the social-emotional development and development for college and careers. We moved from discipline policies to support systems. If there's an infraction, how do we respond. Under the current model, as you all heard already, for certain offenses that can result in out-of-school suspension. Our proposal would remove those because there's actually evidence that suspensions, especially for non-violent crimes and minor infractions, just hurt children. Instead, we'll focus on tiered interventions based on their severity. Some of them might involve students' family engagement or counseling services. There could be peer mediation opportunities"

    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Dr. Smith, thank you so much for walking us through each part of this updated policy. It does seem like there has been a focus more towards restoration instead of only punishments. I think everyone's concerned about making sure the rules don't just protect one group over others unfairly. Is there anything you guys discussed regarding students being able to report when they feel mistreated because of race, religion, or gender, and have that concern followed through on seriously and carefully? This would ensure fair treatment across the entire system.\n```"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Thank you for that question Katrina. Yeah. And to add to that, there was quite a bit of discussion around bias-free reporting mechanisms. Our draft includes procedures for anonymous reporting and ensures that incidents of discrimination, harassment, or bullying related to race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or any other protected class are thoroughly investigated. Furthermore, restorative conversations and processes are designed to help address harm and provide education for both the affected parties and school staff. These revisions aim to create an even safer and more respectful environment for all students. Ms. Smith, can you detail exactly what we have proposed regarding bias-free reporting mechanisms? How would these mechanisms work in practice?\n```"

  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thank you, Jonno.  Yes, Ms. Smith, I appreciate your elaboration on those essential aspects. Additionally, I am particularly interested in how these measures will ensure protection for vulnerable groups within our schools.  You mentioned tiered interventions; could you explain further the implementation process and how these interventions will be evaluated for effectiveness in promoting positive outcomes and reducing recurrences of misbehavior?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thank you, David. To echo your concerns, ensuring that our most vulnerable populations are supported is crucial. Implementing tiered interventions requires a multi-faceted approach. We propose assigning trained counselors or deans to facilitate restorative circles, which bring together students, teachers, and families to address harm and develop solutions. Progress will be monitored through regular check-ins, tracking incident reports, and analyzing student feedback. By continuously assessing effectiveness and gathering data, we can adapt and refine our strategies to best serve our students. Moreover, establishing clear protocols for addressing systemic biases will enable us to identify areas where interventions may need adjustment, ensuring equity remains at the forefront of our efforts."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "I appreciate the clarity on that, Judy. Monitoring progress through multiple channels is vital in gauging the efficacy of these interventions. That leads me to the next point: communication and enforcement of these revised policies and procedures. How do we plan to inform students, families, and staff about these changes, and what training will be provided to ensure consistent application throughout our schools?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Excellent questions, David. Transparency is critical in implementing these changes successfully. To address your inquiry, we envision a comprehensive rollout strategy involving multiple channels, including workshops, online modules, and presentations during Open Houses. We plan to utilize diverse modes of communication, considering varying learning styles and needs, such as graphic illustrations for visual learners or translated documents for language-diverse households.  The key goal here is that stakeholders have access to this information, regardless of their background. Throughout the year, we will conduct reviews of incident responses, monitor patterns, and share updates with the community, emphasizing continuous improvement and growth. For educators, professional development will focus on implicit bias awareness, trauma-informed practices, and restorative techniques. Our collective objective lies in cultivating a culture centered on inclusive and supportive environments where every individual feels valued and respected. What role do you believe our PTSA can play in supporting these rollouts and helping communicate changes effectively?"

  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Kate, that's an excellent plan. I completely agree that inclusivity in our communication methods is crucial. I think our PTSA can play a significant role in amplifying these messages, providing input on how to reach different segments of our community, and offering support for educational events or workshops. Perhaps we could also consider creating a dedicated webpage or resource section on our website, centralizing information and updates on the revised code of conduct and restorative practices. Having a clear, go-to source would facilitate accessibility and encourage ongoing dialogue among stakeholders."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I'm thrilled to hear your enthusiasm for PTSA collaboration, David! A centralized webpage and resource section would indeed streamline communication and ease navigation for families seeking guidance.
