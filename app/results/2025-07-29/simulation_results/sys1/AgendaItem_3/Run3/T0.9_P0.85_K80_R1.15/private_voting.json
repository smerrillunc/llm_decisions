    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.4: Student Code of Conduct - The board will review proposed updates to the district\u2019s Student Code of Conduct, which outlines behavioral expectations and disciplinary procedures. Key changes include new rules around cell phone usage during instructional time, updates to the dress code to reflect inclusivity and professionalism, and revisions to disciplinary consequences to promote restorative practices.. Who would like to start?"

  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Good evening. I'd be happy to start. We all understand the importance of ensuring that our policies align with our values as a school division. Tonight we're here to consider important updates to the code of conduct.  And we've received some great feedback from students parents teachers and administrators. So thank you for your hard work on these drafts. I'm going to take it one at a time. Beginning with item number three point four dot one cell phones and electronic devices. Dr. Osborne? Can you give us an overview? What were the key drivers behind these policy adjustments? How did they come about? Why are we making them?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, Jonno. Our student-led focus groups, surveys, and teacher feedback indicated that unrestricted cell phone use was negatively impacting academic engagement and social interactions. Additionally, we consulted with experts in education technology and adolescent development to inform our approach. As a result, we're proposing guidelines that balance students' need for access to information with minimizing distractions during instructional time."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "It seems there is also a clear intent to address equity concerns related to device access and ensure equal opportunities for learning for every student. This proposal makes sure that any restrictions do not disproportionately affect certain students who may have only their mobile phones available for online research. So how does the revised policy intend to support those kinds of efforts towards greater equity while still addressing classroom disruptions caused by personal device usage?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Absolutely, Katrina. That's a crucial aspect of our equity lens. To address this, the updated policy proposes designated \"tech-free\" zones and times, allowing educators to set boundaries while still permitting reasonable device use for educational purposes. Furthermore, we'll provide alternative solutions, such as laptops or tablets, for students without access to devices, thereby promoting inclusive and equitable learning environments. By doing so, we can minimize potential disparities and create a more level playing field for all students."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Building upon David's points, I appreciate the consideration given to mitigating unintended consequences and ensuring that our policies don't exacerbate existing inequities. As we move forward, it's essential to continue monitoring the impact of these changes, gathering feedback from diverse stakeholders, and being open to further refinements. How do we plan to assess the effectiveness of these updates and make necessary adjustments to guarantee that our intended goals are met, particularly regarding improved academic engagement and reduced disruptions?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Judy, that's a fantastic question! We indeed recognize the significance of continuous evaluation and refinement. To achieve this, we propose establishing a task force comprising teachers, administrators, students, and parents to monitor implementation, gather data, and solicit ongoing feedback. This collaborative effort will enable us to identify areas for improvement, track progress toward our objectives, and make informed decisions about potential modifications to the policy. By embedding this evaluative process into our rollout, we can ensure that our updates remain effective, responsive, and tailored to the evolving needs of our students and community."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "David, I appreciate the thoughtful approach to ongoing assessment and adaptation. The inclusion of diverse stakeholders in the task force is critical to capturing nuanced insights and fostering a sense of ownership among those impacted. Have we considered incorporating explicit metrics or benchmarks to measure the policy's success, such as tracking improvements in student engagement, reductions in disciplinary incidents, or shifts in educator perceptions of classroom management? Establishing clear targets will help guide our decision-making and resource allocation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Excellent suggestion, Judy! Yes, we've absolutely considered developing specific metrics to gauge the policy's effectiveness. In fact, our initial thoughts include tracking indicators such as increased student participation, decreased instances of misconduct, and improved teacher satisfaction with classroom dynamics. We'll also explore ways to collect qualitative data through surveys, focus groups, and interviews to gain a deeper understanding of the policy's impact. By setting clear benchmarks, we can evaluate our progress, refine our strategies, and allocate resources effectively to support our students and staff."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "That's reassuring, David. Clear metrics will undoubtedly facilitate data-driven decision-making and allow us to respond promptly to emerging trends or challenges. Considering the emphasis on restorative practices in the revised discipline policy, I'd like to inquire about plans for providing training and support to educators, administrators, and other staff members responsible for implementing these approaches. How will we ensure that our personnel feel equipped to navigate complex situations, foster constructive conversations, and cultivate a culture of empathy and accountability within our schools?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "A vital question, Judy! Indeed, we recognize that successful implementation hinges on providing comprehensive training and support for our educators and staff. We plan to offer professional development opportunities, workshops, and coaching to equip them with the skills and confidence needed to effectively employ restorative practices. This includes scenario-based training, role-playing exercises, and peer-to-peer mentoring to build capacity and foster a sense of community among our staff. We'll also establish a dedicated support system, consisting of trained facilitators and coaches, to provide guidance and backup when navigating challenging situations. By investing in our staff's growth and development, we can empower them to create safe, supportive, and inclusive environments where students thrive."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "I'm pleased to hear about the commitment to robust training and support. It's essential to acknowledge that restorative practices require a paradigm shift in how we approach conflict resolution and relationships within our schools. Given the complexity of this transition, have we considered allocating sufficient time and resources for this cultural transformation to unfold? Will we be phasing in the implementation across different grade levels or departments, or taking a more incremental approach to allow for gradual adjustment and learning?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Excellent point, Judy.  We must ensure a deliberate and thoughtful rollout to avoid overwhelming our staff and allow for organic growth.  We envision a multi-year implementation plan, introducing restorative practices incrementally at various school levels, starting with pilot programs and gradually expanding to additional sites.  This phased approach enables us to learn from early adopters, refine our strategy, and provide targeted support as needed, ultimately leading to sustainable cultural change."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, Kate, for outlining the proposed rollout plan. I completely agree that a staged implementation is crucial to achieving long-term success. As we embark on this journey, it's essential to prioritize ongoing communication and collaboration among all stakeholders, including students, families, and community partners. How do we plan to keep everyone informed about the progress, successes, and challenges encountered during this transformative process, ensuring that everyone remains invested and aligned with our shared vision?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Ellen, your emphasis on transparent communication resonates deeply with me.  We intend to maintain open channels through regular updates via newsletters, town halls, and parent-teacher conferences. Additionally, we'll establish an online hub featuring resources, testimonials, and real-time data on our progress towards creating safer, more inclusive environments. Our goal is to celebrate triumphs, address concerns, and collectively problem-solve together, thus sustaining momentum and trust throughout this transformation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "That sounds like a great plan, Kate. Transparency and inclusivity are key to building trust and fostering a sense of community. I would suggest we also consider hosting focus groups or listening sessions specifically designed for underrepresented voices, such as students of color, LGBTQ+ students, or students with disabilities, to ensure their perspectives are heard and valued throughout this process. By actively seeking out and amplifying marginalized voices, we can ensure our efforts are truly equity-focused and responsive to the diverse needs of our students."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Absolutely, Ellen. Your suggestion aligns perfectly with our core values of equity and inclusivity. Those very voices often carry the most insight into the systems and structures that need reform. We will indeed organize targeted listening sessions and focus groups to center the experiences and opinions of historically marginalized students, ensuring their unique perspectives inform our work and drive meaningful systemic change."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "I'm glad we're on the same page, Kate. By doing so, we can co-create solutions that address the root causes of inequities and promote a culture of belonging and respect. To further reinforce this commitment, I propose we establish a diverse advisory committee comprising students, parents, teachers, and community representatives to provide ongoing feedback and guidance throughout the implementation process. This collective wisdom will help us stay accountable to our goals and adapt to emerging challenges."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Ellen, I couldn't agree more. The establishment of a diverse advisory committee will serve as a powerful mechanism for sustained engagement, feedback, and course correction. By harnessing the expertise and lived experiences of our community members, we'll not only deepen our understanding of the issues but also develop more effective, culturally-responsive solutions. I wholeheartedly endorse this proposal; let's move forward with forming this critical committee."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Wonderful, Kate! I'm thrilled we've reached consensus on this crucial aspect of our initiative. Next steps would involve defining the committee's scope, roles, and responsibilities, as well as identifying potential members who reflect the diversity of our student population. Let's task Graham with drafting a proposal outline for the advisory committee's structure and membership criteria, which we can review and finalize at our next meeting."

  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Jon, your call to action on data-driven decision-making resonates loudly with me. Indeed, tracking disparities in discipline outcomes, academic performance, and other relevant metrics will be crucial in evaluating the effectiveness of our reforms and pinpointing areas where adjustments are necessary.  To accomplish this, we will implement a comprehensive data dashboard that disaggregates results by student subgroup, providing a clear picture of our progress toward equity. Regular reviews of these metrics will guide our policy refinements, resource allocation, and targeted supports to mitigate any observed disparities. Additionally, we will engage external experts to conduct periodic evaluations, ensuring our methods remain evidence-based and aligned with best practices in restorative justice and education. Through rigorous monitoring and transparent reporting, we will hold ourselves accountable for closing opportunity gaps and delivering equitable outcomes for all students."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Kate, thank you for outlining the framework for data-informed decision-making.  It's essential to couple this approach with robust professional development opportunities for educators and school staff. If our employees lack familiarity with restorative practices and cultural competence, they won't effectively facilitate constructive dialogue and foster empathy within classrooms. Therefore, I recommend allocating funds for intensive training initiatives focusing on implicit bias recognition, trauma-sensitive pedagogy, and de-escalation techniques, allowing educators to create safe spaces where students from all backgrounds feel seen, heard, and valued. What are your thoughts on structuring a multi-year rollout strategy to accommodate these vital trainings?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Jon, you've astutely highlighted the importance of capacity-building among our educators and staff. To successfully integrate restorative practices and cultural responsiveness, we must invest in comprehensive, high-quality professional development that addresses the complexities of implicit bias, trauma, and conflict resolution. I envision a three-year rollout plan, commencing with a summer institute for administrators and teacher leaders, followed by tiered training modules tailored to specific employee cohorts. We'll prioritize partnerships with expert consultants and local organizations specializing in diversity, equity, and inclusion to deliver research-backed content and coaching support. Furthermore, we'll embed reflective practice, peer mentoring, and evaluation components to ensure sustainability and measurable impact. Our goal is to cultivate a workforce empowered to model empathy, empathy, and inclusive leadership, ultimately enriching the educational experience for all students."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Kate, I appreciate the thoughtful consideration given to designing an incremental yet ambitious professional development plan. To complement these efforts, I suggest exploring ways to authentically incorporate student voice into the training design and delivery. By involving students as co-facilitators, coaches, or even program evaluators, we can infuse the training with their valuable insights, fostering greater relevance and buy-in among participants. Moreover, this collaboration will allow us to recognize students' strengths and capacities as agents of change, further empowering them to become active contributors to our shared pursuit of creating more just and compassionate learning environments. Ellen, might you share some thoughts on feasible approaches to meaningfully engaging students in this process?"
