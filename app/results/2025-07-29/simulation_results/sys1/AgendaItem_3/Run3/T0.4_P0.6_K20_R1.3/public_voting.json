    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.4: Student Code of Conduct - The board will review proposed updates to the district\u2019s Student Code of Conduct, which outlines behavioral expectations and disciplinary procedures. Key changes include new rules around cell phone usage during instructional time, updates to the dress code to reflect inclusivity and professionalism, and revisions to disciplinary consequences to promote restorative practices.. Who would like to start?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "I'll kick off our discussions today by saying that we've been working diligently as a team over several months now to revise these policies so they better align with what research tells us about how students learn best while also promoting equity within all aspects of school life. We're excited because it really does have potential to improve academic performance but more importantly help kids develop into compassionate citizens who can navigate conflict effectively later down their lives too. So let me ask Ellen if she could walk through some key highlights from her perspective before opening up questions and comments from you guys. Thanks! (to Ms Osborne) Go ahead please."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, Jonno. Indeed, our goal is to create an environment where every student feels seen, heard, and valued. From my perspective, one significant highlight is the shift towards restorative practices in discipline, focusing on repairing harm rather than simply punishing misbehavior. This approach has shown promising results in reducing suspensions and expulsions, particularly among marginalized groups. Additionally, our revised policy incorporates feedback from teachers, staff, parents, and most importantly, students themselves, ensuring that diverse perspectives are represented throughout the process. What thoughts do others have regarding these proposals?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Well said, thank you both. And just following along those lines, there was another piece mentioned earlier when Dr. Alvarado talked about the importance of communication being clear between home and schools. One thing I think might be helpful here at least initially after implementation may need further clarification is making sure families understand exactly why certain actions were taken against them specifically under each tiered level system since sometimes even though things seem very logical inside the building walls, once outside people don't always see logic behind decisions made without context. It seems important then not only to communicate clearly upfront but make available resources accessible should any family member require additional support understanding specific situations involving individual children. Does anyone else feel similarly concerned about keeping open channels going forward? Or maybe someone wants to address something different entirely right away? Kate Acuff had your hand raised first; go ahead."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Yes, Katrina raises excellent points concerning transparency and clarity in communicating disciplinary measures to families. As educators, we must ensure fairness and consistency across the board. To build trust, we need to provide detailed explanations for decision-making processes surrounding incidents affecting particular students. Furthermore, offering targeted guidance materials tailored toward supporting affected individuals' unique needs demonstrates empathy and commitment to fostering positive relationships between homes and educational institutions alike. Now, Judy Le, did you want to add anything related to implementing such strategies successfully?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "David, I appreciate your emphasis on empathetic approaches. Implementing successful restorative practices requires training for administrators, teachers, and staff to facilitate constructive conversations and foster a culture of mutual respect. By doing so, we can empower students to take ownership of their mistakes, apologize sincerely, and work together to find solutions that benefit the entire community. Effective professional development opportunities will be crucial in equipping our teams to handle complex scenarios sensitively yet firmly."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Absolutely agree, Judy. Providing comprehensive training programs ensures that our personnel possess necessary skills to manage conflicts efficiently and compassionately. Moreover, investing in ongoing coaching helps maintain momentum gained early-on, ultimately leading to long-term systemic change benefiting students directly involved alongside broader campus environments overall. Graham Paige, considering budget constraints often impact resource allocation priorities, shall we discuss possible funding sources dedicated exclusively to facilitating quality teacher-staff trainings essential for effective rollouts of updated codes of conduct?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "That sounds great Dave. If no other person wishes to comment upon either topic currently discussed, perhaps we move onto financial considerations tied closely to providing high-quality instruction sessions. Our current fiscal year includes funds allocated explicitly for employee growth initiatives. However, future budgets may necessitate reallocation based on emerging requirements associated with adopting novel methods outlined above. Are there any suggestions offered by members addressing ways to secure consistent financing streams capable of sustaining vital educator skill-building activities beyond FY22? Perhaps Mr. Oberg, given his experience serving previously on finance committees, he'd share insights garnered thus far. Then again, possibly Mrs. Callison knows relevant information worth sharing. Please proceed accordingly."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Before we dive deeper into securing finances, I'd like to emphasize the significance of prioritizing equitable distribution of resources. When allocating funds for training, we must consider historically underserved populations and allocate proportionally to meet their distinct needs. For instance, schools with higher concentrations of English language learners or special education students may require additional support. Ensuring fair access to resources will enable us to truly drive meaningful change. Can we explore creative partnerships or grants that focus on bridging existing gaps in our districts?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Great point, Judy. Exploring alternative revenue streams via local organizations or foundations committed to advancing inclusive learning spaces makes sense strategically. Another option involves leveraging federal grant monies earmarked for improving K12 outcomes amongst vulnerable demographics. Research indicates substantial benefits derived from incorporating trauma-informed care principles within classroom settings which dovetail nicely with proposed shifts towards restorative justice models. Could we task district administration officials responsible for external fundraising efforts to investigate possibilities aligned with our goals?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Excellent discussion thread, everyone! I completely concur with Judy's emphasis on equitable resource distribution and exploring innovative partnership options. Kate's suggestion to tap into federal grants focused on vulnerable demographic improvement aligns perfectly with our objectives. Let's indeed assign our administrative team to pursue these avenues. Meanwhile, as we deliberate on sustainable financing mechanisms, I propose establishing a working group comprising representatives from various stakeholders \u2013 including teachers, parents, and community leaders \u2013 to monitor progress, identify challenges, and offer recommendations for continuous refinement of our policies and procedures. This collective effort will ensure that our reforms remain responsive to evolving needs while staying true to our core values of equity, inclusivity, and social responsibility. Thoughts on forming this oversight committee?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Thank Ellen for her proposal. A collaborative approach would help keep all parties informed and invested in refining discipline code updates over time. The inclusionary nature of an advisory body also fosters greater accountability through shared responsibilities. How many participants envision placing on this panel, what roles they could fill, and how frequently it convenes warrant careful consideration moving forward if adopted. Would Ms. Osborne clarify whether she envisions quarterly meetings during school years or more frequent gatherings depending on pressing matters requiring attention? Also, does anybody know who ought to chair this entity effectively balancing stakeholder voices amid discussions around sensitive topics potentially arising down the line?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Jon Alcarez brings up valid questions regarding logistics when structuring the suggested monitoring committee. Initially, let\u2019s aim at having ten diverse members consisting equally of three parent volunteers chosen randomly per grade band (elementary/middle/high), two instructional employees selected internally representing each major subject area plus one counselor/social worker pair split evenly among elementary middle and secondary levels along with four appointed central office reps covering student services curriculum diversity/inclusion operations respectively. Quarterly check-ins sound reasonable initially unless urgent issues arise prompting emergency calls-to-action whereupon ad-hoc assemblies are called forthwith. Chairmanship duties might fall under purview of whichever senior administrator oversees policy implementation ensuring clear communication lines exist throughout organizational hierarchies. What do others think here today? Do those ideas resonate generally speaking? Any adjustments desired before proceeding further?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Katrina Callsen has provided excellent guidance on composition and structure; thank you, Katrina. It seems most logical to have someone overseeing policy implementations serve as chairman due to direct involvement in daily operational aspects. To address potential concerns about representation balance, why not establish subcommittees focusing specifically on areas needing extra scrutiny? These smaller units allow targeted exploration without overwhelming primary meeting agendas. We should encourage cross-pollination across subgroups too, allowing them to inform larger decisions made collectively. Does anyone see value in setting aside specific timeslots annually reserved solely for public forums discussing disciplinary reform developments openly with families & communities served? Transparency is key afterall."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "David's idea of creating subcommittees resonates strongly with me. By doing so, we can delve deeper into critical areas such as culturally-responsive teaching practices, mental health supports, and family engagement strategies. Cross-functional collaboration between these groups will facilitate knowledge-sharing and foster holistic solutions. Additionally, dedicating annual town hall-style events for open dialogue with constituents sends a powerful message about our commitment to transparency and community-driven decision-making. As we solidify plans for the oversight committee, I recommend integrating explicit expectations for regular reporting back to the full board, ensuring seamless flow of information and fostering trust among stakeholders. Shall we outline concrete deliverables and timelines for both the main committee and its subsidiary bodies to guide our work ahead?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Absolutely agree with Judy's call for transparent reporting structures alongside defined milestones tied directly to actionable steps taken toward systemic improvements. Establishing measurable benchmarks enables data-based assessments of effectiveness, ultimately driving refinements grounded firmly upon evidence rather than anecdotal feedback alone. Furthermore, scheduling dedicated sessions exclusively centered around publicly engaging constituent input underscores dedication to ongoing evolution guided primarily by end-user perspectives. Lastly, perhaps we invite Dr. Paige Graham Page to provide some insight concerning possible metrics used elsewhere successfully measuring efficacy of similar initiatives aimed squarely at enhancing educational experiences equitably distributed across entire student bases. Her familiarity with research-backed best-practices shall prove invaluable informing future evaluation frameworks designed locally."

    "content": "Yes, absolutely. And just thinking aloud right now, but maybe even looking at attendance rates, suspension numbers, graduation rates, things like that. But then again, there must be other measures beyond simply quantitative ones because sometimes qualitative stories tell far better narratives. So yes, please go ahead. If any of my colleagues want to add anything else, feel free to jump in anytime. Otherwise, I'll give staff direction based off your suggestions later tonight following adjournment. Thanks very much. All righty. Is there motion first reading approval of changes to JFOD/JFDA dress codes effective immediately pending second read scheduled next month? Seconded by Mr. O'Callaghan. Motion carried unanimously. Next item number five deals with cell phone usage revisions. Mrs. Colson, did you wish to make opening remarks prior to hearing comments from everybody else present? Or am I mistaken entirely? No. Okay. Then certainly no need really exists to belabor points already covered extensively earlier since last night was pretty well-covered territory anyway. Therefore, I'm going to ask Vice-chairman Acuff to lead off followed clockwise once he concludes his thoughts. Please proceed whenever ready sir.  OKay. Well, thanks Dave. Yeah, sure thing. First, I'd say good job getting rid of the tier system altogether. That simplifies everything greatly. One question though remains unanswered still. Are kids allowed personal devices inside classrooms period regardless of instruction being delivered digitally versus non-digitally? Because currently nothing explicitly prohibits their use outside digital lessons. Clarification needed somewhere clarifying device presence rules overall. Maybe something added onto page six stating clearly 'Students cannot possess electronic devices anywhere except designated zones.' Just throwing out another thought streamlining section B slightly bit clearer. Instead of saying 'teachers discretion,' instead state'staff member authority', making certain consistency prevails everywhere campus-wide uniformly applied. Other than minor tweaks mentioned above, looks great otherwise. Now Ms. Del Carro-Alvarado. Go ahead ma'am. You're recognized.   davidoberg: Sure. My only comment regards adding teacher flexibility given unique circumstances presented every day. For instance, permitting instructors leeway determining appropriate technology uses fitting individualized lesson designs promotes academic freedom somewhat stifled previously. Our educators understand varying contexts surrounding tech integration thusly empowering them accordingly acknowledges inherent professionalism found naturally occurring within talented educator ranks. Empower professionals acting professionally always yields superior results long-term. Onward. Ms. Coulson, were you prepared to respond"
