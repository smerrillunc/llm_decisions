    "comment": "Should the board adopt the revised Student Code of Conduct, including updates to cell phone policies, dress code, and discipline procedures?.  If each of you could please record your vote in the chat, I will tally them up and announce the results.\n\nkatrinacallsen: To further solidify a safe learning environment while fostering equity and fairness within our disciplinary procedures, I wholeheartedly endorse the formation of a dynamic committee to reshape our student code of conduct policies.\nThis decision underscores our relentless quest for culturally inclusive and socially just classrooms, especially now when nurturing holistic development demands the most attentive care possible."
