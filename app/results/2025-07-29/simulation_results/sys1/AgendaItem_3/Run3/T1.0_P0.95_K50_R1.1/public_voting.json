    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.4: Student Code of Conduct - The board will review proposed updates to the district\u2019s Student Code of Conduct, which outlines behavioral expectations and disciplinary procedures. Key changes include new rules around cell phone usage during instructional time, updates to the dress code to reflect inclusivity and professionalism, and revisions to disciplinary consequences to promote restorative practices.. Who would like to start?"

    "content": "I'll kick things off. As you know, we reviewed our student code at the end of last year through a committee made up of students, teachers, parents, and administrators. It was clear that changes were necessary. Today, let me share some key features of these proposed updates. For example, one update involves creating specific guidelines around electronic devices while learning takes place. And they're focused on maximizing educational experiences across all levels. We'll have discussions about other elements shortly. Does anyone else want to add? I'd love to hear from folks on that side of the aisle. There were no recommendations by the school principals. A couple people talked about a tiered approach, so instead of immediately jumping to discipline as an automatic punishment system for non-compliance, there are alternatives that the teachers would give kids such as reminders, talking it out, or offering a different assignment if their device is not being used properly. So you have those intermediate steps before something more drastic would happen. There was no support to go ahead with the policy. Any final thoughts, Ms. Callan?  You've had quite a bit of experience with discipline policies. Do you think we should offer any flexibility to the campuses or schools? I'm thinking we may need to bring this back again when there isn't quite so much business going on at once, maybe get another public hearing and then just vote on whatever adjustments that we make after taking input from the public. We got the whole community involved, even the state association was part of it too and that way it's more collaborative for how all parties want it. Then everybody has a say. What do you propose that Mr. Alcaro's changes are incorporated into this report in front of us today for Mr. Gupton. Ms. Kaufman? How about this? I heard this week also - but it doesn't sound right that it could be implemented within the next two weeks. Is that the best thing to do on behalf of the kids for the kids who get disciplined? If we can get a good solution that works for the most kids possible and the most families possible? Maybe the way it stands now is already good. To my knowledge, since all those incidents happened here in town, none of them were a result of someone's attire. I'd be willing to offer my assistance in any capacity that makes sense going forward and try to put some of the fears away. Thank you very much. Are there any of those suggestions that we can actually take"

    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "It seems to me that this work group wants and intends to implement positive approaches but we're having difficulty aligning the language. There are multiple times where language describes alternative methods of discipline, but then it describes alternative means of teaching discipline and that's problematic because it still sounds punitive.  I think we really need to change the vocabulary we use here. But what we do and how we structure ourselves has an impact on students.  I appreciate the recommendation to go slower and to involve our principals, teachers and other stakeholders to build out our plans in a way that meets the various needs that exist across this school division.  And I certainly am concerned about equity issues if we don't pay attention to this issue.   As Dr. Osborne pointed out, how can you decide whether a behavior is disruptive if the teacher is not going to look at intent behind the action before responding."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, Katrina. I completely agree that the language used in the policy is crucial in conveying our commitment to restorative practices and equity. We must ensure that our words and actions align to create a safe and supportive environment for all students. I suggest we revisit the language to focus on rehabilitation rather than punishment, emphasizing empathy and understanding over discipline. By doing so, we can foster a culture of trust and respect between teachers, students, and administrators."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Yes, to emphasize rehab and repair of relationships and repair harm. That was what we hoped to accomplish with the circle conversations but we didn't provide training or structures for staff on implementing it, we just expected they could intuitively facilitate circle conversations, which left it incomplete as a program. That has made it difficult and we haven't addressed it sufficiently yet. There's been so little training for school personnel in circle practice principles. Without that guidance, the process of using the restorative circles has become uneven."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "I concur with Ellen and Katrina that reframing our approach from punishment to rehabilitation and empathy is essential. By doing so, we can cultivate a more inclusive and supportive environment for all students. Our implementation of restorative practices requires comprehensive training and resources for our staff, ensuring a consistent and effective application across our schools. Only then can we genuinely address the complexities of student behaviors and create opportunities for growth, healing, and redemption. Can we discuss how to incorporate additional training and resource allocation for our educators in our updated code of conduct?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "I fully endorse the sentiments shared by Ellen, Katrina, and David. The language employed in our policy must accurately reflect our dedication to restorative practices, equity, and rehabilitation. To achieve consistency in implementation, providing thorough training and resources for our staff is vital. This will empower them to effectively utilize restorative circles and foster a culture of empathy and understanding."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I'd like to re-emphasize the importance of data collection in evaluating the effectiveness of these approaches, particularly in terms of disparate impacts on historically underrepresented groups. We must commit to tracking metrics beyond just suspensions, including academic performance and graduation rates to understand if our efforts truly yield positive outcomes for all students. Let's prioritize equity-focused assessment tools to measure progress towards a more equitable disciplinary framework. Additionally, engaging our entire community in this process remains critical; incorporating diverse perspectives, especially from students, parents, and teachers, ensures we craft solutions tailored to our unique needs."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Absolutely, Kate! Data-driven decision-making is essential in gauging the success of our revised code of conduct. By collecting and analyzing data on academic performance, graduation rates, and other key indicators, we'll be able to identify areas for improvement and make informed decisions to better serve our students. I recommend establishing a task force to develop and implement an equity-focused evaluation framework, which includes diverse representation from our community, to ensure we're holding ourselves accountable for creating a fair and supportive learning environment."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Ellen, your suggestion resonates deeply with me. An equity-focused evaluation framework is a great step towards measuring our progress in addressing systemic inequities and improving outcomes for marginalized students. Furthermore, involving diverse voices through a task force ensures we tap into community expertise and generate recommendations that tackle the root causes of disparities. This task force should also consider developing professional development opportunities for our educators to enhance their ability to engage in culturally responsive teaching practices and support students who have faced discipline disproportionately."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "I couldn't agree more, Kate. Culturally responsive teaching practices are crucial in creating an inclusive learning environment, and our educators play a vital role in this effort. By providing targeted professional development opportunities, we can equip them with the necessary skills to address the unique needs of our diverse student population. This, in turn, will help us move closer to achieving our goal of eliminating discipline disparities and promoting academic success for all students. I propose that we explore partnerships with local organizations and experts in culturally responsive education to inform our professional development strategies."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "A valuable proposal, Ellen. Let's reach out to those organizations, bringing in experts with lived experience in restorative practices, culturally responsive pedagogy, and trauma-informed care. Incorporating this knowledge and insight within our professional development efforts can significantly improve student outcomes. I also agree that involving stakeholders in designing a comprehensive equity-focused evaluation framework will lead to greater buy-in and collective ownership of the goals we strive to achieve in our schools. By working collaboratively, I'm optimistic we'll find ways to bridge the disparities in discipline and achievement we've seen within our system. Thank you both for emphasizing the significance of that partnership. And, now, may I ask David Oberg to share his insights?  What thoughts does he bring forth regarding further development?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Jonno, thank you for inviting my thoughts. I believe we're on the right path by recognizing the need for comprehensive professional development, culturally responsive teaching practices, and an equity-focused evaluation framework. As we move forward, I'd like to stress the importance of sequencing our efforts strategically. We should start by providing foundational training on restorative practices, followed by targeted support for culturally responsive pedagogy and trauma-informed care. It's equally crucial that we allocate sufficient time for our educators to absorb and integrate these new skills into their daily instruction. Finally, let's ensure our evaluation framework is iterative, allowing us to regularly assess our progress and make adjustments as needed to optimize our impact on student outcomes and reduce disparities."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I completely agree with your strategic plan. To support it, I suggest that Dr. Page brief us on the present state of our budget allocations before we delve deeper into detailed action steps, so we might have a better grasp of any financial considerations we would need to weigh when making these important decisions. That context, along with community input and stakeholder collaboration, will enable us to devise a clear and feasible plan to advance this work forward. Would Dr. Page give us some insight into that right now?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Yes, happy to do so, Katrina. Given our commitment to equity and restorative practices, we're prepared to realign current budget allocations and identify potential future investments supporting training and resources related to culturally responsive pedagogy and restorative practices. In short, while there may be budgetary implications, we anticipate rebalancing existing funds versus seeking major additional appropriations. However, I encourage the board to think creatively about partnerships, grants, and external funding sources to amplify our investments. With such collaboration, I am confident we will find the means to actualize our vision for a compassionate and inclusive school climate that honors the whole child."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thank you, Dr. Paige, for clarifying that situation for us today. Based on what we've heard thus far, I propose that we instruct the administration to proceed in crafting a draft document around changes to our disciplinary policies focused on equity and cultural sensitivity as well as detailing a pathway for teacher professional development. I think that once we get that first draft and see where we stand on alignment and consistency across the divisions, then we could consider how best to invite stakeholder engagement, whether it's advisory committees, town hall meetings, or open hearings. It seems to me at least, that having something concrete in hand would allow a richer discussion and feedback loop with the entire community. If no one has anything to add, I think that gives everyone here tonight the assignment they need moving forward. Is there anyone else wishing to contribute to our discussion?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "I appreciate Katrina's proposal and would like to build upon it. Before proceeding with the draft document, I suggest we establish a small working group comprising administrators, educators, and community representatives to review our current policies and research best practices in culturally responsive discipline and restorative justice. This group can provide crucial input to the administration as they craft the draft document, ensuring it aligns with our values and goals. Additionally, their involvement will facilitate a smoother transition during the stakeholder engagement phase."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "A thoughtful suggestion, David. Establishing a working group will indeed provide valuable perspectives and expertise, ultimately leading to a more robust draft document. I recommend including at least two student representatives, preferably from marginalized communities, to offer their invaluable insights and voice throughout the process. By doing so, we not only ensure a more comprehensive understanding of the issues but also demonstrate our commitment to amplifying student voices in shaping their educational experiences."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "I couldn't agree more, Judy. The inclusion of student representatives from marginalized communities is essential to guaranteeing that their unique experiences and concerns are considered and addressed. Their participation will not only enrich our policy revisions but also foster a sense of ownership and empowerment among our student body."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I concur entirely with David and Judy. By engaging students directly impacted by our policies and inviting them to play active roles in shaping these reforms, we underscore the critical importance of student perspectives and experiences. Our revised code must promote inclusivity and respect; listening to those whose voices often go unheard is vital."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "I'd like to acknowledge the collective wisdom in this room and express appreciation for the thought-provoking ideas shared. I strongly support establishing a diverse working group, including student representatives, to inform our policy revisions. This collaborative approach will help ensure we create a culturally responsive and equitable discipline code that truly serves all students. Let's move forward with assembling this working group, and I propose we schedule a follow-up meeting to discuss the group's findings and draft document. Shall we aim for three weeks from today to reconvene and review their recommendations?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "I agree with Kate Acuff's sentiments regarding inclusivity and respect, as well as Ellen Osborne's suggested timeline. If no other members object, I recommend finalizing our motion accordingly: we task Dr. Paige's team with creating a culturally sensitive and restorative discipline policy draft within the next three weeks, in tandem with a newly established working group consisting of teachers, students, parents, and administrators. This collaboration will result in a policy revision that is both informed by our values and representative of the diverse stakeholders involved. In that spirit, shall we call the meeting adjourned?\n```"

    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Before we conclude tonight's session, I wish to express my gratitude to each and every one of you for contributing thoughtfully to this meaningful discussion on culturally responsive discipline and restorative practices. Your insightful suggestions and unwavering commitment to advancing equity in our educational ecosystem fill me with hope for the bright futures of our children. May the work we embark upon be a testament to the power of collaboration, compassion, and visionary leadership. With your agreement, Jonno Alcaro, I hereby declare this meeting officially closed. We look forward to reconvening in three weeks to examine the policy draft crafted collaboratively by our designated working group."
