    "comment": "And after hearing from all other Board members, I also am going to vote yes because this resolution aligns with what we've heard throughout these public hearings about how important it is to make sure there isn't any confusion when people come into those meetings so they know exactly who their representatives are by name rather than just having an at-large seat number assigned to them.\nI'm glad Dr. McLaughlin brought forward this motion based upon some concerns he had expressed during his campaign last year regarding transparency within local government bodies like ours where citizens may not always easily identify which district each elected official represents without knowing more information beyond simply seeing only numbers associated alongside names listed somewhere online but never actually being able to see boundaries visually displayed anywhere else unless actively seeking out such details themselves through additional research efforts outside regular meeting materials provided directly via email updates sent periodically containing agendas along with minutes taken down verbatim documenting discussions held among us every month since taking office officially back then starting January first two thousand twenty-three up until now today May eleventh two thousand twenty three\nSo thank you again Doctor John Mclaughlan bringing forth this proposal addressing citizen concern over lack clarity surrounding representation districts shown clearly enough currently especially considering many residents do live near borderlines separating different areas represented differently across Albemarle County Virginia even though most voters still don't realize fully implications behind voting procedures used here locally compared against statewide elections conducted separately elsewhere around commonwealth stateside simultaneously happening same day November eighth next fall season coming soon sooner than later hopefully allowing time needed beforehand educating ourselves further learning lessons drawn past experiences shared openly amongst colleagues working together collaboratively moving ahead unitedly supporting betterment quality life enjoyed living inside county limits everywhere equally distributed fairly representing everyone residing therein regardless race gender identity sexual orientation age disability income level occupation status married single divorced separated widowed student worker retiree young old native born immigrant documented undocumented homeless housed renter owner etcetera ad infinitum equal opportunity given fair shot pursuing happiness freely chosen path desired personally professionally academically recreationally socially culturally spiritually politically economically environmentally sustainably responsibly interdependently peacefully harmoniously respectfully gratefully humbly empathetically compassionately honestly transparently accountably inclusively equitably diversely open-mindedly progressively historically grounded adaptability embracing change courageously standing strong staying vigilant speaking truth power boldly leading wisely serving selflessly giving generously receiving graciously sharing willingly listening attentively caring deeply relating genuinely connecting meaningfully belonging completely contributing positively impacting greatly appreciating abundantly celebrating joyfully remembering thankfully growing continuously improving steadily persevering patiently trusting faithfully"
