Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.4: Student Code of Conduct - The board will review proposed updates to the district\u2019s Student Code of Conduct, which outlines behavioral expectations and disciplinary procedures. Key changes include new rules around cell phone usage during instructional time, updates to the dress code to reflect inclusivity and professionalism, and revisions to disciplinary consequences to promote restorative practices.. Who would like to start?"

    "content": "Thank you, Graham. I think it might be helpful if we break down each part of these code of conduct updates, maybe start with something that really jumps out at me because I do hear from families across this whole spectrum is the Cell Phone Update Policy Within Instructional Time. So maybe we could look a little closer at that. How many people, David, would want us to give some thought as well? Some wanted to make sure they were never allowed ever period; then you've got others saying \"Oh no, let them make decisions\" and that makes our job harder. How can we make some good inroads here in what we're proposing now? So there are actually things like in my building, Mr. Bostic has his students have lockboxes and put their phones away, right next to their desk but yet he said I'm still having kids pull them out and text behind screen so we need to consider what kind of impact do we expect to have here versus where we are currently because these kids use those in classes just like any other class tool, okay? And I know there are some areas like math where you probably need a calculator more often than others but that's a whole different story. We also looked at different options where all technology had to be completely silent or not even be brought into classrooms like what one person mentioned, which really surprised me that kids actually liked it more, they said I did better because I was focused more. Is there any way we get feedback from schools who try some pilots here that we can bring back to the board or administration and we can say here are some things we learned, or some places I heard say they had success with certain procedures? One pilot area or not necessarily doing it one place but like I said last meeting I thought about that one school where kids who lost priviledges had to go to lunchtime in a quiet study area. I'd love to know how does that work. This year we piloted in an elementary by taking away recess for discipline issues. I think that may deter from the behavior or activity more. Another option might be like what Dr. Doering originally mentioned: what could be seen as making that penalty for breaking your contract be related with whatever device being used during class time. It feels like if you decide to use that device that time during instruction you lose privileges on technology-related opportunities later on in the day or that same week because I guess sometimes a teacher takes away recess, that doesn't mean the"

    "content": "Jonno, thank you. There's some interest among students about getting devices out of classrooms, at least from an instructional point of view. Some educators have talked positively about silent phone hours or cell phone free days which I think will give teachers and administrators real-life data on whether the outcomes improve when electronic devices aren't available. But if I remember correctly, Kate Acuff asked me to speak briefly about one proposal before our last board meeting. I will share one of her concerns which was that student athletes who got injured or otherwise kept out of physical education class could still participate somehow using virtual fitness tracking and exercise programs on their mobile devices. But to ensure responsible digital citizenship and maintain focus within the classroom environment, Kate's perspective highlights exceptions such as individual accommodation needs, medical alerts, family emergencies, and approved educational uses are essential to balance policy against potential negative impacts.  I don I know the proposal I believe provides for some of these accommodations already built into our revised approach.\n```\nunknown:\n\nunknown: And I know there are some areas like math where you probably need a calculator more often than others but that's a whole different story.

    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Yeah, I agree. One thing we should explore is having a range of approaches, rather than a one-size-fits-all solution. A mix of pilots and gathering feedback from various schools will help us refine our policy. Additionally, considering exceptions like Kate mentioned earlier, we should ensure our revised policy accommodates individual needs while promoting responsible digital citizenship. What I'd like to add is the importance of communication with parents and students regarding our updated policy, so everyone knows what to expect and why these changes are necessary. Perhaps we could develop guidelines or rubrics for teachers to consistently implement these new rules, and provide ongoing support for staff on managing classroom technology usage. We need a clear understanding of how our policy aligns with our teaching goals, too. Any thoughts on this?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thank you, David, for emphasizing the significance of communication and consistency across our schools. To build upon that, I suggest we establish a task force comprising teachers, administrators, and students to oversee the implementation of our revised policy. This group can monitor pilots, gather data, and provide regular updates to the board. By doing so, we'll ensure a responsive and adaptable approach that respects diverse learning environments and fosters meaningful engagement from our stakeholders."
  },

  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Excellent points, Kate! Establishing a tentative timeline will indeed help us stay focused and ensure a smooth implementation process. Based on our current discussion, I suggest we aim to finalize the revised policy by the end of the first semester, which would give us sufficient time to gather feedback, pilot test, and refine the policy. This would also allow us to implement the new policy at the start of the second semester, providing a clean slate for all parties involved. Shall we discuss this timeline further and consider any potential adjustments before moving forward?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "The suggested timeline appears reasonable, provided we factor in contingencies to accommodate unexpected challenges or insights emerging during the pilot phase. Ensuring that all relevant stakeholders receive training or professional development support before implementing the revised policy will also be critical to its success. Ellen, would it be feasible to integrate key milestones and deadlines within the proposed task force charter, outlining specific deliverables, roles, and responsibilities?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Absolutely, Jonno. Incorporating key milestones and deadlines into the task force charter will not only clarify expectations but also promote accountability and transparency. I recommend that the charter outline specific tasks, timelines, and responsible parties, including the task force members, educators, administrators, and district staff. This will enable us to track progress, identify potential roadblocks, and make adjustments as needed.

Consulting school administrators, assessing infrastructure requirements, and exploring innovative partnerships with local organizations, civic leaders, and telecommunications providers all seem essential components to ensuring equal access and bridging the digital divide. In incorporating these considerations into the task force's scope of work, I suggest we establish measurable goals and objectives related to equity, accessibility, and community engagement. By setting these targets from the outset, we can better monitor progress, adapt our strategy when needed, and maintain focus on closing the equity gaps. How might we best define and track those metrics to gauge our success and inform future refinements to the policy?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Great idea, Jonno. Establishing measurable goals and objectives will help us stay focused on achieving equity and accessibility. To define and track those metrics effectively, I propose that the task force develops a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) tied directly to equity, accessibility, and community engagement. Examples could include indicators such as percentage of students with reliable home internet access, number of community partnerships established, and student surveys assessing device availability and satisfaction. By regularly tracking and analyzing these KPIs, we can assess our progress, identify areas needing refinement, and make data-informed adjustments to the policy going forward. We can also utilize our regular progress updates to the board to share our findings and solicit input from the community.\n```"
