    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.4: Student Code of Conduct - The board will review proposed updates to the district\u2019s Student Code of Conduct, which outlines behavioral expectations and disciplinary procedures. Key changes include new rules around cell phone usage during instructional time, updates to the dress code to reflect inclusivity and professionalism, and revisions to disciplinary consequences to promote restorative practices.. Who would like to start?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Thank you Graham. I'd be happy to lead off on the updated discipline policy section that shifts our focus towards restorative practices. Our goal is to support students who've made a mistake by holding them accountable while also teaching life skills and promoting healing within the school community.  We're not just disciplining but helping kids grow from their actions.  It starts with teachers engaging in reflection circles after incidents and before assigning any punishment. This collaborative approach encourages empathy understanding and responsible decision-making. So we can move away from punitive measures and build more positive relationships between educators students peers and families.  The policy changes are attached as Exhibit A. Any questions so far?  Kate I think you have some thoughts about this part of it too right. Could I get your feedback please. Thanks."

    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Jon, thank you very much. Yes, I do want to commend Jon on all his work on this piece because he has done an amazing job bringing people together across different stakeholder groups. And what resonates most strongly to me is the way these policies shift us from simply meting out punishment to actually giving young people tools to repair harm when they make mistakes and figure out how to better navigate those complex situations. That means providing spaces where students feel seen heard and valued throughout that process even if there needs to be accountability still for the behavior at hand. One thing I'd add though is we should explore ways to help staff gain training on facilitating reflective conversations in those circles so everyone feels comfortable leading discussions. What ideas does anyone else have on getting that kind of teacher support rolled out effectively?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "David Oberg asked the question of whether all of our stakeholders were considered when developing this student code of conduct. Well, yes, I can confirm that was indeed the case. For instance, the parent committee had multiple opportunities to weigh in. But Dr. Osborne did suggest another round of meetings with stakeholders prior to adopting anything next year. And one comment she got back today suggested we need to hold open forums in addition to all the smaller working group sessions which could take place next year. So the suggestion I believe makes sense given our commitment to hearing diverse perspectives and fostering a spirit of collaboration here. Next spring is ideal for all parties involved. Does anybody else agree with that timeline?\n```"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "I appreciate Katrina's summary, and I concur that including additional stakeholder input through open forums is essential. However, I'd like to propose considering these changes sooner rather than later. Given the importance of implementing restorative practices, let's aim to finalize the revised code of conduct by the end of this semester. That allows us to provide necessary training for staff over the summer and roll out the changes smoothly come fall. Can we discuss possible timelines for achieving this?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "I understand David's urgency, yet I'm concerned about rushing into implementation without adequate preparation and buy-in from all stakeholders. While I agree that restorative practices are crucial, we must ensure that our educators receive thorough training and support to facilitate effective reflective conversations. Rushing the process might undermine its success. Perhaps we could strike a balance by setting up pilot programs or small-scale implementations this spring, gathering feedback, and then finalizing the revised code of conduct by the end of the academic year. This approach would allow for thoughtful consideration of stakeholder input and sufficient training for staff."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Judy raises valid concerns regarding the pace of implementation, and I appreciate her proposal for piloting restorative practices this spring. By doing so, we'll gather valuable insights, refine our approach, and ultimately create a stronger foundation for successful implementation. I'd like to suggest we allocate resources to support this phased rollout, ensuring that participating schools receive necessary training and guidance. With careful planning, I believe we can achieve meaningful progress this spring and set ourselves up for full implementation by the following academic year. Would others agree to this compromise?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I appreciate both David's push for timely action and Judy's cautionary note. Implementing restorative practices requires both expediency and deliberation. Piloting these approaches this spring aligns well with our goals and values. To further strengthen this effort, I recommend partnering with local organizations experienced in restorative justice to augment our internal capacity and offer high-quality professional development for our staff. This partnership would enhance the rigor and effectiveness of our pilots, positioning us for a smoother full-scale implementation in the subsequent academic year."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "I appreciate the thoughtful dialogue and suggestions thus far. I agree that piloting restorative practices this spring, with proper training and support, is a prudent step forward. Additionally, Kate's idea of partnering with local organizations specializing in restorative justice is excellent, as it would bring valuable expertise and resources to our efforts. As we move forward, let's prioritize equity and inclusivity in our implementation plan, ensuring that the voices of historically marginalized students and communities are centered in our decision-making processes. How can we intentionally incorporate their perspectives and experiences into our pilot design and evaluation methods?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Ellen, I couldn't agree more about centering marginalized voices throughout this process. To answer your question, we should engage directly with students, particularly from underrepresented groups, via surveys, focus groups, or advisory boards. Their lived experiences will inform and enrich our pilot design, allowing us to tailor restorative practices that address specific needs and concerns within our student body. Moreover, we should establish clear metrics for measuring equity outcomes during and after the pilot phase, such as tracking disciplinary disparities or perceived fairness in consequence assignment. This data will guide adjustments to our approach, ensuring that restorative practices truly serve all students equitably. Can we task our equity team to lead this effort and report back to the board?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Thank you, Kate, and I think it's imperative that we operationalize the concept of incorporating student voice and experience into the heart of our pilot and assessment strategies. I am reminded of a great point made earlier, too. We should consider creating safe spaces for reflective practice and learning amongst teachers themselves. The whole system will benefit if we prioritize teacher self-reflection alongside empowering students. Let's also acknowledge that building trust takes time and starts with authentic engagement. If we're able to stay grounded in mutual respect while being mindful of power dynamics, we can build strong relationships between stakeholders that benefit everyone in the long run. Are there any other thoughts around the role of teacher reflection within the overall framework we're discussing today?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Jonno, thank you for bringing up the significance of teacher self-reflection in the context of building trust among stakeholders. Our Board has consistently emphasized the value of inclusive decision making. Thus, fostering a culture where educator voices are respected and valued becomes paramount to the success of any new initiative. It seems to me that the springtime pilot program offers an opportunity to develop mechanisms for teachers' ongoing growth in this area. How do people feel about committing some funds towards providing professional development targeted at supporting teacher reflection and growth throughout the upcoming school year? In particular, how does our current budget allocation look in relation to potentially earmarking funds for teacher professional development focused on improving discipline policies and classroom management? Is that something we can explore?\n```"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Excellent points have been raised about the importance of teacher reflection, self-awareness, and continuous growth. I fully endorse allocating funds for targeted professional development opportunities that empower educators to excel in their roles. This investment will yield significant returns in terms of improved instructional quality, enhanced student-teacher relationships, and a more positive school climate. Regarding our current budget, I believe we can reallocate existing resources to accommodate this critical need. Perhaps our finance committee could review the budget and identify areas where we can optimize spending to free up funds for this purpose. I propose we commit to exploring this option and present findings at our next meeting. Does anyone else support this direction?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "I completely concur with David's suggestion to repurpose existing budget allocations to support teacher professional development. It's crucial we invest in our educators' growth, particularly when introducing innovative approaches like restorative practices. I'd like to add that we should also examine potential external funding sources, grants, or partnerships that could supplement our budget and amplify our impact. By combining internal reallocation with external resources, we can create a robust support system for our teachers and maximize the effectiveness of our initiatives."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Well said, Judy! Exploring external funding opportunities can indeed help us stretch our dollars further and attract additional expertise to bolster our efforts. I propose that we task our administrative team with researching potential grant options and partnerships that align with our goals, and report back to the board within the next quarter. Meanwhile, our finance committee can continue to review our internal budget to identify areas for reallocation. By pursuing both avenues, we can ensure a comprehensive approach to supporting our educators and driving meaningful change in our district. Shall we formalize this directive and assign responsibilities accordingly?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I second the motion to direct our administrative team to research external funding opportunities and our finance committee to review the internal budget for reallocation possibilities. This two-pronged approach ensures we're exhausting all avenues to support teacher professional development and ultimately, our students. To facilitate collaboration and accountability, I suggest we set a deadline for the administration to provide a list of potential grants and partnerships by the end of March, and for the finance committee to present revised budget recommendations by early April. With these timelines in place, we'll be well-positioned to make informed decisions about resource allocation and planning for the upcoming school year. Does that sound reasonable to everyone?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Absolutely, Kate! Your proposed timeline and assignments are crystal clear and pragmatic. By setting concrete deadlines, we can ensure that our teams remain focused and motivated to deliver results. I'm confident that our collective efforts will yield a robust plan for supporting teacher professional development and implementing restorative practices effectively. Before we proceed, may I request a quick recap of the action items we've agreed upon so far? Specifically, who will take the lead on which tasks, and what are the corresponding deadlines?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Excellent suggestion, Ellen. For clarity and reference purposes, let's summarize the key action items and responsible parties: One, the Administrative Team will research external funding opportunities (grants and partnerships) related to restorative practices implementation and report back to the board by end-March; Two, our Finance Committee will review the internal budget for reallocation possibilities to support teacher professional development and present revised recommendations by early-April; Three, our Equity Team will spearhead student-centered co-design and piloting of restorative practices with feedback from diverse student groups and equity metrics established. They will share updates regularly and submit a final report in June; Four, the Education Committee will collaborate closely with teachers and administrators to fine-tune policy revisions, focusing on disciplinary procedures and consequences, dress code, cell phone usage, and communication strategies, culminating in draft policies ready for approval in late May. Finally, Graham, please confirm whether this summary accurately captures the assigned tasks and due dates? And is there anything else we might want to include before moving forward?"

    "content": "Yes, excellent job summarizing those important details. It appears your recitation covers all salient points. But, yes, I would just like to say I think it would be really great if perhaps our education chair and vice chair could reach out to the other members of the board to remind them of our specific charges coming out of this session, maybe even schedule check-ins as needed. Thank you very much. OK, if that is accurate, then I declare this meeting adjourned. Thank you all again, especially Judy Le. She did such an outstanding job leading our discussion tonight.
