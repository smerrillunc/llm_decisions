    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.4: Student Code of Conduct - The board will review proposed updates to the district\u2019s Student Code of Conduct, which outlines behavioral expectations and disciplinary procedures. Key changes include new rules around cell phone usage during instructional time, updates to the dress code to reflect inclusivity and professionalism, and revisions to disciplinary consequences to promote restorative practices.. Who would like to start?"

  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "I'll kick off our discussion by saying that we've had a lot of feedback from students about wanting more autonomy over their own learning environments while still maintaining focus within classrooms. So let me ask Katrina Callsen if she could walk us through some specific details regarding these policy adjustments related to cellphone use as well as any other key components you'd recommend adding into those policies before they come back here at first reading next month. Thank you very much! And then after Ms. Callson is done speaking, Mr. O'Berg can discuss how he sees it impacting his school specifically. Then Dr. Coughlin has asked her team members who have been working diligently behind-the-scenes to provide an overview of what was heard throughout all stakeholder groups so far. We also want to make sure there are no questions left unanswered today because once again, communication remains crucial moving forward. Thanks everybody! Go ahead, Katrinnia."

    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Okay Jon thanks for kicking things off tonight with your comments. As mentioned earlier, one major change includes revising student conduct guidelines surrounding personal electronic devices such as phones and headphones. This update aims to strike balance between allowing technology access when necessary but minimizing distractions inside class settings where instruction takes place. To do this effectively, teachers may set clear classroom-specific parameters based upon lesson plans, individual needs, etcetera. For instance, maybe kids need earbuds listening to audio content tied directly to lessons being taught; however, browsing unrelated material isn't allowed without teacher permission. Another area involves updating language addressing bullying behavior including cyberbullying incidents occurring outside regular hours yet affecting educational performance negatively. Finally, discipline measures now incorporate alternative approaches focusing on restoration rather than punishment alone \u2013 something many stakeholders requested be explored further following last year's survey results. These modifications aim not only improve overall academic environment quality but foster better relationships among peers too. Davin? Your thoughts please!\n```"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "\"Thank you, Katrina. It sounds like thoughtful consideration went into crafting these updated policies. At my school, Lincoln High School, implementing flexible device management strategies should help minimize disruptions and allow educators to tailor digital tools according to each subject matter. Additionally, incorporating alternatives focused on rehabilitation instead of solely punitive actions aligns closely with our commitment towards fostering empathy and understanding.\""

  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Great point David thank you for sharing perspective from LHS. Yes indeed flexibility allows instructors adaptability given diverse teaching styles plus varying levels of tech integration across subjects. Also agree wholeheartedly re alignment w/ empathetic values & promoting positive interactions amongst scholars. Kate Acuff did you wish add anything else prior to Judy Le providing summary findings gathered thusfar via community engagement sessions? Or perhaps Graham Page wanted input right away? Please go ahead either way."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Actually, Kate, might I suggest briefly touching base on potential training opportunities for staff to ensure seamless implementation of revised policies, particularly concerning restorative practice incorporation? Perhaps even consider peer-to-peer coaching models or workshops led by experts familiar with successful implementations elsewhere?\""
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Absolutely, Dave. That makes perfect sense considering both effective rollout and ongoing support structures needed going forward. Our administration must prioritize educator preparation alongside infrastructure development supporting inclusive spaces conducive to constructive dialogue exchange. Ensuring proper resources exist helps guarantee consistency system-wide. Ellen Osborne, were similar concerns voiced during parent forums held recently? Did attendees express interest in receiving information detailing available avenues seeking assistance navigating conflicts resolution processes involving children enrolled under these newly established codes?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Indeed, Kate, several parents expressed concern about ensuring adequate training for faculty and staff, especially in terms of adopting restorative practices. They emphasized the importance of creating safe spaces for open conversations and conflict resolutions. Moreover, participants highlighted the necessity of accessible channels for families requiring guidance on resolving issues arising from the application of these novel regulations. Parents sought clarity on roles and responsibilities within schools, underscoring collaboration between administrators, counselors, and teachers in facilitating smoother dispute settlements. By engaging proactively with caregivers early-on, we build trust and strengthen partnerships essential for long-term success. Next steps involve distilling actionable recommendations derived from public engagements, refining them collaboratively with relevant parties involved."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Excellent recap, Judy. Clearly, multi-stakeholder buy-in requires transparent lines of communication along with defined pathways guiding users toward helpful solutions. Given parental requests for increased accessibility, shall we explore establishing dedicated web pages outlining protocols governing disputes' escalation process, together with contact info listing department heads responsible for offering targeted advice? Furthermore, does anyone propose scheduling follow-up town halls post-policy adoption to gauge effectiveness and address emerging areas needing refinement?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "I completely concur with Kate's suggestion to create centralized online resources clarifying dispute resolution mechanisms and designated points-of-contact. Transparency is vital in building trust with our communities. Regarding follow-up town hall meetings, I think that's an excellent idea. Regular check-ins will enable us to assess progress, gather feedback, and refine our approach as needed. Let's schedule quarterly reviews to monitor implementation efficacy and identify areas necessitating adjustment."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Agreed, Ellen. Quarterly assessments would facilitate continuous evaluation and adaptation. Incorporating a review component ensures accountability and fosters systemic improvements driven by data analysis. Shall we task administrative teams with drafting initial versions of informational materials (e.g., FAQs) summarizing changes made to cell phone usage rules, dress code revisions, disciplinary procedures updates, and new emphasis placed on restorative justice principles? Once drafted, share drafts widely internally and externally inviting additional suggestions before finalization."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Thank you very much everyone. So it seems then that next step-wise, first draft those documents explaining policy shifts while simultaneously planning future town-hall gatherings assessing how well they're received over time. And let me just confirm here if possible -- can someone clarify whether any specific timeline exists currently regarding formalized roll-out dates targeting full-scale implementation at start of '23-'24 term? Are we looking more mid-year adjustments potentially depending on fall semester observations? Just trying get some clarification around timing expectations shared publicly later down line. Anybody know details related to timelines out there?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Jon, yes, your summation accurately captures action items moving forward. As far as timelines are concerned, after reviewing stakeholder comments collected through June, July, August, September, October, November, December, January, February, March, April, May, and finally June again, target date remains aligned with beginning SY202324 when all components come fully operational. We'll continue monitoring throughout spring semesters making sure smooth transitions occur districtwide. If unforeseen challenges arise prompting slight delays, naturally, timely notifications reach affected groups accordingly. Thanks! Now unless other topics require discussion today, feel free proceed adjourning meeting formally. Final remarks welcome anytime though."
