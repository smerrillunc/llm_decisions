    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.4: Student Code of Conduct - The board will review proposed updates to the district\u2019s Student Code of Conduct, which outlines behavioral expectations and disciplinary procedures. Key changes include new rules around cell phone usage during instructional time, updates to the dress code to reflect inclusivity and professionalism, and revisions to disciplinary consequences to promote restorative practices.. Who would like to start?"

    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Dr. Page, I know the committee had some strong discussions about these. Can we take the three key sections one by one to allow more effective feedback, since they touch on very different aspects of student life? I could kick off the phone policy part.  We were thinking a stricter approach could be beneficial for minimizing distractions in class. Our students have done great work helping shape our revised policy, too. It proposes specific times for personal electronic devices during school hours, so kids can stay focused during lessons yet retain access as an educational tool."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Dr. Acuff, could you clarify how much latitude teachers will have when it comes to allowing phones in the classroom beyond that framework. I'd think there might well be subjects where phone usage may still make sense, so what parameters do we have in place for teacher discretion? Also, how is mental health accounted for in these policies if we're limiting their access to certain social media apps?\n```\nuser:<? Pontli:  We want to ensure that students understand that this particular provision has zero intent to curb the freedom that each kid has over their devices out of school. It just ensures that in our education setting, devices really don't disrupt instruction but help create more opportunities for deep dives within the context provided. For mental health concerns, the administration really works hard to provide resources. A number of organizations are trying to address the challenge directly by addressing root causes or providing free and accessible tools. Some are even partnering with schools offering these resources right at school while also giving parents the possibility to access these through district partnerships.\n```"

  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thank you all so much for bringing up both perspectives from the committee and from the standpoint of teaching staff and from parents. And thank you, Dr. Alcaro for kicking us off with the proposed changes on cellphone use. And I love your acknowledgment of that balance between being a productive tool in the classroom and a distraction during other times. That seems particularly important here. On your last thought, Dr. Pontli, as someone who does see the real issues and not just potential downsides within student phone use but also those upsides and benefits that we truly believe we've got to find a spot where both sides kind of play effectively. Do teachers have enough support and training for using technology inside their classrooms effectively, ensuring learning outcomes without losing engagement levels because now these students have devices they may not even know how best to leverage for the classroom environment.\n```"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Yes, it was actually part of our conversation last night during professional development. Dr. Copeland spoke regarding upcoming professional learning courses that she and the instructional services team offer, working closely with individual departments as we have been asking teachers for ideas on how best they think this could go down. Our teachers will receive information, the training sessions that Dr. Copeland mentioned should help guide them along the way. They'll be able to make sure as they're planning their year lesson plans to identify areas where tech helps deepen that content and give kids meaningful applications from that perspective, so that's why we feel pretty encouraged and hopeful for teacher buy-in there. \n```"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "I'm glad to hear that professional development is underway to support teachers in incorporating technology effectively into their classes.  As we consider this updated policy, I'd like to emphasize that we must ensure fairness and consistency across all campuses, taking into account varying student needs and experiences. Could we discuss how we plan to monitor and enforce these new guidelines to prevent unequal application among schools or between teachers within the same school? This will be critical in maintaining trust with our students and families."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Absolutely, David, and thank you for highlighting the need for equity and consistency in implementing these new guidelines. To build upon your point, I suggest we also explore ways to involve student voices in the monitoring and enforcement process, perhaps through student-led committees or focus groups. By doing so, we can better ensure that our policies remain responsive to the diverse needs and perspectives of our student population. What are your thoughts on this approach?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Judy, I completely agree with your proposal. Engaging students in this process will not only provide valuable insights but also foster a sense of ownership and responsibility among our students. I propose we establish clear communication channels, such as regular check-ins or surveys, to gather student feedback and concerns throughout the implementation phase. Additionally, we should consider creating incentives for positive behaviors, rather than solely focusing on consequences for non-compliance. By doing so, we can cultivate a culture of mutual respect and collective accountability within our schools."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I appreciate the emphasis on equity and student voice in enforcing the updated policy.  In terms of incentives, I think that's an excellent idea, David. Let's brainstorm ways to recognize and celebrate responsible phone use and academic engagement, perhaps recognizing classes or teams that demonstrate exemplary self-regulation or innovative uses of technology. I'd also like to invite Dr. Copeland to share her thoughts on any data tracking tools or dashboards that could help monitor progress, identify areas of improvement, and inform future refinements to the policy."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "I couldn't agree more, Kate. Recognizing and celebrating responsible phone use and academic engagement can be a powerful motivator for our students. I also appreciate your suggestion to explore data tracking tools or dashboards to monitor progress and inform future refinements. Dr. Copeland, could you please elaborate on the types of data we might track and how we can ensure that it's used to support rather than surveil our students? Additionally, I'd like to add that we should consider involving parents and guardians in this process, perhaps through regular updates or workshops, to ensure they're aware of the policies and can reinforce responsible phone use habits outside of school."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Well, Dr. Osborne, in relation to the type of data that could be collected, some suggestions include things like the frequency and duration of phone usage during school hours, student grades and performance metrics, and records of disciplinary actions related to phone misuse.  In terms of how the data could be utilized, this includes identifying trends and patterns in phone usage that could lead to better decision making around cell phone policies, developing targeted interventions and support systems for students struggling with managing their phones, and refining our existing curriculum to more effectively incorporate technology and digital citizenship."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Excellent suggestions, Dr. Alcaro. Collecting and analyzing data on phone usage, academic performance, and disciplinary actions can indeed help us identify areas for improvement and inform evidence-based decisions. I especially appreciate your emphasis on using data to develop targeted support systems for students who struggle with phone management, which aligns with our commitment to equity and inclusivity. How do you envision we can ensure that our data collection and analysis processes prioritize student privacy and confidentiality, while still providing us with valuable insights to improve our policies and practices?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Dr. Osborne, protecting student privacy and confidentiality is paramount in this endeavor. One strategy we might employ is utilizing de-identified data or aggregating data at the class or school level, thereby minimizing the risk of personally identifiable information being exposed. Furthermore, we should explicitly outline procedures for securely storing and sharing data, adhering to relevant federal and state laws regarding student data privacy, and clearly communicate these measures to students, parents, and staff alike to promote transparency and trust."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Well said, Dr. Alcaro. De-identifying data and aggregating at the class or school level can help mitigate risks to student privacy. It's also essential that we develop clear protocols for data storage and sharing, ensuring compliance with federal and state laws. Transparency and communication are key; by keeping our stakeholders informed, we can build trust and confidence in our data-driven approach. I'd like to add that we should also consider establishing a data governance committee, comprising representatives from various departments and stakeholder groups, to oversee data collection, analysis, and use, and ensure that our policies and practices align with our values of equity, transparency, and accountability."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Dr. Osborne, I wholeheartedly endorse the concept of a data governance committee, comprised of diverse stakeholders. Such a committee would help guarantee that our data collection, analysis, and utilization align with our core values of equity, transparency, and accountability. Furthermore, it could facilitate ongoing oversight, monitoring, and refinement of our data systems, ensuring that we continually adapt to emerging challenges and opportunities. This collaborative approach would not only uphold student privacy and confidentiality but also empower evidence-informed decision-making across our district, ultimately benefiting our students and the broader community."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "I couldn't agree more, Dr. Alcaro. A data governance committee would provide a critical layer of oversight and ensure that our data practices remain aligned with our values and priorities. By bringing together diverse stakeholders, including teachers, administrators, students, and community members, we can leverage collective expertise and perspectives to drive informed decision-making and positive change. I'd like to suggest that we also explore ways to engage our local university partners in this effort, potentially through research collaborations or capacity-building initiatives, to further strengthen our data infrastructure and analytic capabilities."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Excellent question, Ms. Callsen. Transparency and inclusivity are essential components of this partnership. To ensure that we're engaging our stakeholders meaningfully, I propose we establish a dedicated webpage on our district website to centralize updates, news, and information related to the partnership. We can also utilize social media platforms and regular newsletters to keep our community informed. Additionally, let's plan to hold town hall meetings, parent-teacher conferences, and focus groups to solicit feedback, answer questions, and gather insights from our stakeholders. This will not only foster a sense of ownership but also allow us to incorporate diverse perspectives and ideas into our partnership. Your thoughts on this approach?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "That sounds like an excellent plan, Dr. Osborne. In addition to your proposals, might I also recommend developing a stakeholder advisory group composed of teachers, administrators, parents, students, and community representatives? This would allow for consistent two-way communication, permitting individuals closest to the work to inform our decision-making and implementation processes directly while also serving as ambassadors for the partnership within their respective spheres. By doing so, we can ensure broad understanding, enlist grassroots support, and proactively troubleshoot challenges as they arise.  Would any other board members care to comment on or add to this suggestion?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "I appreciate Ms. Callsen's insightful suggestion. Creating a stakeholder advisory group would provide a structured mechanism for gathering diverse perspectives, fostering a sense of accountability, and encouraging ongoing feedback. As we establish this partnership, it's essential that we remain attuned to the needs and concerns of our constituents. By empowering a representative group to serve as liaisons, we can build trust, enhance collaboration, and ensure that our initiatives align with the interests of those most affected \u2013 our students, families, and broader community. I wholeheartedly endorse Ms. Callsen's proposal. Dr. Osborne, would it be possible to outline the parameters and composition of this advisory group, perhaps including its role, meeting frequency, and expected outcomes?"
