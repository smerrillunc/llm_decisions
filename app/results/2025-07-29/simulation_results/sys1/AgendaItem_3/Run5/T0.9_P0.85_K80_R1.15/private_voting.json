    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.4: Student Code of Conduct - The board will review proposed updates to the district\u2019s Student Code of Conduct, which outlines behavioral expectations and disciplinary procedures. Key changes include new rules around cell phone usage during instructional time, updates to the dress code to reflect inclusivity and professionalism, and revisions to disciplinary consequences to promote restorative practices.. Who would like to start?"

  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "I'd be happy to initiate the discussion by offering some context about why we are here today. Over the past year our administrative team has been working closely with teachers, students, parents, and local law enforcement agencies to revise policies that better aligns with evidence based practice, promotes greater consistency across schools, addresses long standing issues around equity disparities, provides greater clarity to families, and takes into consideration current research around student development and behavior support. And all these efforts have led us to the comprehensive set of policy recommendations you see before us tonight. Thank you."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Dr. Alcaro, thank you very much for framing up those efforts. One question is do you plan to allow school principals to implement any unique aspects to their own campuses as far as how they approach discipline? That might be one way we can help them to improve things.\n``` Bison Puncher: What a joke! You're just gonna take away more rights from kids at school. Kids already get treated so bad there. These dumb people making rules are never right. Don't even let the children decide what happens because it is not like their thoughts matter anyway. ```"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "I appreciate Jon's thorough explanation, and Katrina's insightful question. As for our guest's passionate comment, I understand the concern, but I must respectfully disagree. Our goal is to create an environment where every student feels safe, supported, and empowered to succeed. While it's true that students' voices should be heard, our role as educators is to provide guidance and ensure accountability. We strive for fairness, equity, and inclusivity in our policies. By doing so, we can foster a positive learning atmosphere that benefits everyone involved. Now, regarding Katrina's question, I think it's essential to strike a balance between giving schools autonomy and maintaining consistency throughout the district. Perhaps we could discuss ways to offer flexibility while still adhering to our core values and objectives."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Mr. Oberg makes sense. To expand upon his idea, if we want to build trust among schools and stakeholders, maybe each campus principal could contribute ideas or suggestions within reason for tailoring approaches in line with district-wide goals. It seems reasonable to consider multiple perspectives in implementing solutions that benefit diverse populations of students. This kind of open communication fosters mutual respect and acknowledges differences without diluting overall standards. What are your views, colleagues, about empowering principals and teachers to customize certain elements while staying true to our collective vision?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Building on David's and Katrina's points, I believe it's crucial to establish clear guidelines while allowing for adaptability at the school level. This balanced approach enables us to address specific needs and concerns unique to individual campuses. By providing a framework that incorporates input from administrators, teachers, students, and community members, we can create a more nuanced and effective system that prioritizes both equity and responsiveness. I'd love to explore possible mechanisms for soliciting feedback and incorporating stakeholder insights into our decision-making process."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thanks, Judy, for highlighting the importance of striking a balance. To further this point, perhaps we could discuss establishing a regular feedback loop to monitor implementation and assess its impact. Additionally, I propose setting up a task force comprised of representatives from various stakeholders, including teachers, students, parents, and administrators, to gather data and make adjustments as needed. By continuously refining our approach through collaboration and evidence-based analysis, we'll ensure that our revised policies effectively serve our entire school community. Would others agree on the value of ongoing evaluation and refinement?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Absolutely, Kate. A dedicated task force and continuous assessment will enable us to stay informed, responsive, and adaptable. This collaborative approach ensures that our updated policies remain relevant, effective, and aligned with the evolving needs of our students. I recommend we also prioritize professional development opportunities for staff to ensure they feel equipped to implement these changes successfully. By doing so, we can create a culture of growth, empathy, and understanding that permeates every aspect of our educational ecosystem."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Ellen, I completely concur on the need for professional development and creating a supportive culture. To further emphasize that point, I suggest we allocate resources for training programs focusing on implicit bias awareness, trauma-informed care, and restorative practices. By investing in our staff's capacity to address complex student needs, we can foster a more compassionate and equitable learning environment that truly honors our commitment to social-emotional well-being. How might we best integrate these training initiatives into our existing staff development structures?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Kate, that's a fantastic suggestion. I propose we incorporate these trainings into our existing professional learning communities (PLCs) and coaching models. This integration will allow us to leverage our current infrastructure while ensuring a cohesive and sustained focus on equity, trauma sensitivity, and restorative practices. We could also invite external experts to facilitate workshops and provide ongoing support, thereby enhancing our staff's confidence and competence in addressing the diverse needs of our students."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Excellent idea, Ellen. Embedding these critical topics within PLCs and coaching models will promote consistent application and peer-to-peer learning. Inviting outside experts to supplement our internal expertise will also bring fresh perspectives and cutting-edge knowledge to our teams. Let's also explore partnering with local organizations specializing in trauma-informed care and restorative practices to amplify our impact. Their experience will be invaluable in helping us develop culturally sensitive interventions tailored to our community's unique needs. Who would like to volunteer to lead this effort and collaborate with me on identifying potential partners?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Thank you all for such thoughtful discussion. I certainly see value in giving school principals some latitude to tailor disciplinary measures to their respective campus environments, while still operating under the umbrella of our overarching principles. And Kate, I wholeheartedly endorse your proposal for a task force to regularly review policy effectiveness, solicit stakeholder input, and drive refinements. I'm happy to co-chair that initiative alongside you, Ellen, or another colleague. Furthermore, integrating implicit bias, trauma-informed care, and restorative practice training into PLCs is a superb strategy for equipping staff with vital skills. Let's proceed thoughtfully yet expeditiously, taking advantage of available expertise and community partnerships to strengthen our commitment to student wellness and academic success."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Jon, thank you for volunteering to help spearhead the task force; Kate and Ellen have already begun outlining key aspects of the group's scope and responsibilities. As our next step, let's finalize the membership composition and define specific roles to guarantee representation across different groups. To augment their work, I suggest scheduling quarterly check-ins during which the task force shares findings and recommendations with the full board. Such transparency and collaboration ensure seamless adoption of any updates or revisions by stakeholders invested in the policy's long-term success."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "That sounds like an excellent plan, Katrina. Quarterly progress reports will indeed facilitate openness, accountability, and alignment throughout the process. For optimal task force membership, I think we should aim for diversity in terms of job functions, grade levels represented, and geographic locations.  Perhaps one teacher representative per high school, along with several middle and elementary educators; two or three parent representatives, chosen via PTO channels or other parental networks; plus two administrators -- say, a high school assistant principal and either a middle school principal or vice-principal; lastly, one non-voting student delegate who serves for one year before transitioning back to being a normal student again. The latter participant may offer valuable student-centric insights and could take part in certain discussions but not formal votes.  If everyone agrees, then what would be the next logical steps toward getting this task force operationalized?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "I appreciate Jon's suggested task force composition, which seems comprehensive and inclusive. Before finalizing the roster, however, it would be wise to consider consulting with union leaders, special education advocates, and counselors to garner additional perspectives. By doing so, we'll ensure a richer, more diverse set of voices informing our decisions and fostering a stronger sense of ownership among stakeholders. Once the task force is formed, we can move forward with defining their roles, responsibilities, and communication protocols. It's crucial that we establish clear expectations around information sharing, meeting schedules, and documentation processes to maintain transparency and efficiency throughout their work."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "David, I couldn't agree more about seeking broader input from key stakeholders. Consulting with union leaders, special education advocates, and counselors will undoubtedly enrich our decision-making process. I'd like to add that we should also engage with local mental health professionals and community organizers who specialize in youth services. By casting a wide net, we'll gain a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding discipline, inclusivity, and student welfare. This collective wisdom will empower our task force to craft policies that genuinely respond to the needs of our students, particularly those from historically underserved populations. Shall we set a deadline for gathering feedback from these additional stakeholders and schedule a follow-up meeting to discuss their contributions?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Judy, I completely concur \u2013 involving local mental health professionals and community organizers will provide essential context and expertise. Setting a deadline for gathering feedback is prudent, as it will keep our momentum going while allowing sufficient time for meaningful engagement. I recommend aiming for a four-week window to collect input from the expanded stakeholder group. Following that, we can reconvene to synthesize the feedback, identify patterns, and distill key themes. With this approach, we'll ensure our task force has a solid foundation upon which to build effective policies that prioritize student well-being and academic achievement. Shall we ask Katrina to draft a brief outline detailing the stakeholder outreach plan and timeline for our review prior to the next meeting?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Yes, I can prepare that document. Additionally, I propose we assign each board member to serve as liaisons for various stakeholder groups, ensuring timely and efficient communication between them and our task force. This way, every perspective receives due consideration without overwhelming our working group with too many direct connections. Lastly, let's decide how often our task force should report its progress to the entire board beyond the scheduled quarterly updates. Should they share bi-monthly summaries of meetings and findings through email, or perhaps host informal listening sessions where members can address questions or concerns directly with the task force?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Katrina, your suggestions are spot-on! Assigning liaison duties to individual board members will streamline communication, and providing bi-monthly written updates alongside quarterly presentations strikes a great balance between keeping us informed and respecting the task force's autonomy. These steps will ensure our policy development stays data-driven, inclusive, and attuned to our community's evolving needs."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thank you, Kate. I believe we're on the right track. Graham, do you have any thoughts on structuring our liaison assignments or assigning someone to coordinate logistics for the task force's work? We want to make sure all necessary resources are allocated efficiently to support their efforts."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Actually, yes, I was thinking that having a coordinating lead within administration might be helpful because, in addition to supporting the task force, there must be some sort of monitoring system to ensure our implementation goes smoothly. And we should recognize potential conflicts of interest within stakeholder participation. Our liaison structure is perfect for reporting up to the task force but if we get bogged down, a point person within administration will help clarify matters quickly. It would fall under the purview of the assistant superintendent of instruction.  It would also probably involve somebody from HR and Dr. Haas. So we don't know exactly what title, but that would give us administrative support to both monitor the effectiveness of the changes as well as smooth out any bumps. What I'm trying to say is it won't just go away after the task force presents their work. It will need ongoing support from administration. Then the question becomes, what kind of administrative setup do we need to put behind it once we start implementing? And that leads me to another thing. Would we anticipate a transition period for the new policies and procedures? Do we bring everything online at the beginning of the following year? Or phase it over time? How are we going to roll this out effectively for teachers and staff?   They need to understand that something significant changed here. So when we begin rolling it out, maybe even doing small pilot projects or bringing in a couple of schools first to iron things out before going whole hog district-wide. So in essence, this is really an evolving project rather than something that simply concludes when the task force hands off their work product. Does anyone else see it that way? Or am I mistaken?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Absolutely, Graham, I think you're correct in emphasizing the importance of administrative support and a thoughtful rollout strategy. A dedicated coordinator within administration will indeed facilitate the implementation process and help mitigate potential challenges. Your suggestion to phase in the new policies and procedures, potentially piloting them in select schools initially, resonates with me. This approach allows us to fine-tune our strategies, gather feedback, and build capacity before scaling up district-wide. As we move forward, let's continue to prioritize equity, transparency, and collaboration, ensuring that our policies ultimately benefit all students and foster a positive learning environment."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Well said, Ellen. If we implement a phased rollout, we could choose two or three schools representing different demographics across the division and then use lessons learned during that initial rollout to refine practices before expanding countywide. One other thing worth considering might be to survey teachers toward the end of the school year to gauge their comfort level regarding the policy shift. Their early involvement may reveal areas needing extra attention so we focus our training initiatives accordingly. This proactive approach positions us to handle hiccups ahead of time. To guarantee success, it's vital that we listen closely to our educators' concerns and requests throughout the journey. Any additional ideas or comments?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Before moving further into logistical discussions, may I suggest we consider a critical component still somewhat unclear to me, namely the evaluation criteria by which the task force will measure policy efficacy and success. Defining these metrics now will allow us to set clear goals and better guide the decision-making process later. Perhaps this aspect deserves a separate agenda item for discussion. By clarifying our objectives, we'll increase the chances of creating evidence-informed policies yielding desirable outcomes for our students. Graham, I agree entirely about phasing our rollout strategically, and gathering teacher input along the way will definitely prove invaluable in optimizing our strategies. Has everyone considered any possible professional development opportunities we might offer our teachers in preparation for adopting these policy shifts?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "John, that is such a crucial observation, especially given that we've never attempted anything like this before, particularly when looking at discipline. With restorative circles and that side of it, we have had zero experience whatsoever in the past. That being said, identifying benchmarks upfront will absolutely provide us clarity and direction going forward. The last part of your comment, though, reminds me that we also need some baseline information, specifically on suspension rates currently and demographic breakdowns associated with those numbers. From my vantage point, that number one goal for me has always been reducing suspensions while simultaneously improving overall classroom climates. I truly believe in the long run, our actions will generate improvements on student achievement scores. But we need to define precisely how we plan to evaluate those components. Thanks again for pointing out that omission. I completely concur that we require explicit evaluative measures, whether quantifiable metrics or qualitative observations derived through surveys or focus groups. You raise a very important consideration, and our next meeting could tackle just that topic exclusively. Are others comfortable focusing on establishing performance indicators during the October session?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I fully agree with Graham's emphasis on collecting relevant data prior to the rollout. Establishing baseline suspension rates and demographic information helps inform our evaluation methods, making future assessments more accurate. It would also enhance transparency throughout this transformative initiative. By defining specific targets now, we can adjust course where needed, thereby promoting continuous improvement. Furthermore, dedicating the next task force meeting solely to developing assessment criteria will position us for successful implementation.  Shall we add a motion to formalize the scope of that upcoming discussion to our agenda?"
