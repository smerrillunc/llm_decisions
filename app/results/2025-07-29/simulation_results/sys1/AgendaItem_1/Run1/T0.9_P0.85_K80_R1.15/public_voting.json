    "content": "Thank you. In terms of budget planning and funding allocation, I would like clarification as to whether these monies have been accounted for within our current budget, whether we'll need to revisit that process, and if so how they might affect other priorities. And then also I'd appreciate an update regarding exactly where we stand in regards to state-level education budgets that could possibly assist us in offsetting costs here locally. Can someone help me better understand those financial details before I comment further about project benefits?   Kate, Dave. Do either of you want to jump into any of those questions I asked first. Kate maybe about your communication with local reps. Then after that we can hear from our staff people. Thanks."

    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Jon, thank you very much. Yeah, what was stated in your letter about a little more than $8 million allocated out of last year's budget for capital improvement projects is accurate. That amount does include both items A and B. However, the funds must be used by the end of next fiscal year. So I think there may not actually be too many issues associated with getting the money available but rather fitting all of the work within the timeline given that deadline and also making sure it doesn't interfere with ongoing educational activities during the year. It seems obvious that having some idea of when the best time to do things is going to be pretty critical, especially in case it looks like the weather turns cold sooner versus later and we're still trying to get certain stuff done outside at least part of which has nothing to do with the track and field stuff but also involves the parking lots and entrances for visitors. There were also requests for estimates on future maintenance and replacement costs.  It appears that we've got pretty good data for the past five years in order to forecast what annual expenses may look like moving forward based upon historical patterns. And it seems to me right now, even though nobody likes surprises and nobody wants to be caught off guard, these seem relatively modest compared to what one finds around here already. We are doing OK with that kind of thing right now. With that said, however, please don't take my word for anything yet because I realize my math skills aren in question sometimes. If something really jumps out as being way off base, feel free to share it with others who can say it makes no sense whatsoever. Anyway, the bottom line is it sounds like it should probably make financials possible although I'm sure there's always potential room for surprise down the road just due to external factors. At this point I believe they're looking like numbers we can live with so far. Does anyone else wish to talk on this subject for a bit longer? After I let Dave respond briefly to see what he says, then Dr. Osborne or somebody else will come up front and explain their roles and offer insights. Davidoberg? Would you mind giving us an updated summary of where matters currently sit within those state-level deliberations as they pertain specifically to budgeting and also describe whatever local assistance we expect to obtain for renovations? Maybe also touch base on any changes that the local delegation thinks we can anticipate to ensure that any sort of partnership opportunity is capitalized upon without waiting until its last minute."
