    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.2: High School Renovation Project - The board will consider approval of funding for major facility improvements at the high school, including building four new science laboratories and repairing the athletic fields. The science lab construction is projected to cost $1,240,400 spread over four years, while athletic field repairs are included in the same package. These upgrades aim to improve STEM instruction and student access to safe extracurricular facilities.. Who would like to start?"

    "content": "I'd be happy to kick it off. Thank you, Dr. Paige. Colleagues, as many know by now, our students deserve better than what they're getting from these aging facilities. Inequitable access to quality spaces that can provide them equal opportunities in education. Our current state has already affected several cohorts negatively. We need not look further than last year's disappointing performance in AP Sciences, nor the lack of competitive spirit we see among students today.  The renovation project before us offers an opportunity to address these systemic inequalities head-on. What questions do people have?  Are there any specific concerns regarding the proposal? Is anyone familiar enough to present the full scope of work proposed for both science labs and athletics fields? I'll let other colleagues chime in. It may help inform my own thoughts about phasing and budgeting going forward.   For myself personally, I am deeply concerned about how we can ensure equity remains top-of-mind throughout this process and maintain open communication channels with stakeholders all along the way. This should result in improved outcomes that benefit every single one of our children.  And to Ms. Cuff's point about our capital projects list, perhaps a follow-up discussion around prioritization might be timely if others agree. Thank you.  Does anybody want to proceed next? Or shall we hear more comments right away? Then discuss questions together.  How does everyone feel about hearing more background information first then discussing as a group later on in time today?  So that makes sense to me. Thanks so much, Mr. Alcaro. Ms. Osborne. You wanted to ask a question. Yes, please.  Ms. Callsen. Please go ahead. That was your request earlier. I think that that was your original question, anyway. Did someone else just raise their hand?  My apologies. All those wishing to speak had better stand up or I won't call upon you. Mr. O'Berg, Mr. Page. Go ahead.  Sorry, excuse me. To get back to my previous thought here a little bit, and thank Ms. Cuff for reminding me.  First round of bidding out of five contractors only came in very close.  One company submitted bids under our architect estimate which made everybody happy. As I mentioned during my summary, $1,243,000 includes design development. $250,000, roughly 20% contingency. $200,000 architectural fees, inspections services for approximately $30,000"

    "content": "And finally, permits are planned at around $15,000.  If you don't mind sharing more details behind each category to give context, that would be helpful in providing transparency when asked about it down the line after tonight. But otherwise, no question right now.\n```\nunknown speaker:    Hello everyone, I'm Kate Acuff. I would love to respond to some things that were said earlier. A little worried about doing so because of timing. We've got so many items left on the agenda, but since we didn't finish talking about this particular topic completely, that is, number three. And because this community engagement aspect really is so important to me too, although sometimes challenging even with other obligations outside of school, because I guess part of why folks get involved in this governing body type of thing is maybe having children who go through schools, having grandchildren. I care greatly about whether they are receiving what they need and then being inquisitive within the classroom setting too. They could use new infrastructure. But in addition to all that is there something unique, I mean, this committee, the advisory committee that Dr. Graham brought up during her statement.  Would she describe more fully what that committee is designed to accomplish in terms of gathering input, representing voices that need to have input to create buy-in at that level in addition to at least two more town hall meetings? I also requested information about phase implementation. Can somebody talk more specifically to that? When will we likely complete Phase One, Two and Three, assuming we decide to greenlight this. I believe they do take place concurrently, correct? They will run simultaneously in various aspects. And that is going to make planning complex for people outside. As far as safety goes, I cannot imagine how awful it must be to walk into the stadium area, realizing conditions aren't favorable. I think I heard something described where you wouldn't choose to sit down for fear of injury. Those are just unacceptable situations. Just in case, did he say what types of injuries have been documented historically due to problems associated with either track resurfacing that isn't happening soon enough, or athletic equipment malfunctioning occasionally with a coach. Lastly for me personally I hope that we put more focus on long-term thinking and sustainability. We went through COVID recently. Things changed rapidly and fast. I appreciate how adaptable educators are generally, always pivoting so well. However, I worry that if we install whatever, then end up with something short-lived in"

    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "\"Thank you, Kate. I share your concern about long-term thinking and sustainability. I'd like to add that incorporating green building practices and energy-efficient designs into our renovations could have significant cost savings over time while promoting environmental stewardship. Perhaps we could explore ways to incorporate these elements into the project plan?\""
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "David, that resonates strongly with me. Sustainability indeed helps lower costs down the road. I am particularly interested in learning from staff members working on sustainability initiatives across the district already. What potential resources could they provide, given their expertise, related to sustainable practices and materials that align with this initiative?\n```"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "\"Kate, excellent idea! Our existing sustainability team has valuable knowledge that could greatly enhance this project. I recommend inviting them to join our discussions and provide guidance on environmentally friendly options. Their input could help us identify opportunities for cost savings, reduce waste, and promote eco-friendly practices throughout the renovation process.\""
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Absolutely, David. It seems critical to integrate this essential perspective early on in the decision-making process. By involving our sustainability experts upfront, we can ensure consideration of innovative approaches that ultimately serve both students' needs and the environment."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "\"I agree wholeheartedly, Kate. Incorporating their insights from the outset will not only benefit the environment but also provide an opportunity for experiential learning and hands-on educational experiences for our students, further enriching their STEM instruction and fostering a culture of responsibility towards the planet's future.\""
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Exactly, David. This integration of sustainability principles supports multiple goals, including enhancing student learning outcomes while promoting responsible stewardship of our natural resources. I wonder, Dr. Paige, might our science department leaders weigh in on potential connections between the renovated facilities and STEM curriculum enhancements, ensuring alignment with state standards and emerging trends in education?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Well, let me address some parts of that first, Kate, before turning to the Science Department Chair. We had mentioned sustainability and incorporated certain components into those plans from the beginning. We do recognize its importance in both maintaining costs, but also the role modeling component, so we'll continue to consider all ideas we receive along those lines. Also, we'll invite our Sustainability Team to participate moving forward. That makes total sense. Regarding phasing construction activities to minimize disruptions, our intent remains that these projects happen simultaneously, albeit separated by location as much as possible, phased to accommodate the scheduling requirements outlined by different stakeholders such as coaches and event organizers. The full construction timeline and the exact phasing schedule, though, should come together once contracts are awarded and actual construction begins. Finally, regarding athletic field repairs, safety issues are certainly factors driving the current proposal. Injuries reported include falls caused by uneven surfaces, tripping hazards resulting from cracks or damaged areas, plus concerns associated with wetness and puddles that make slippery walking or running risks greater than we want to see. No severe incidents occurred, luckily, but the hazards definitely exist. At the moment, the entire scope encompasses all athletics fields, except for Brown Middle School, where improvements took place last summer. Thanks for asking, Kate, and again, thanks for bringing attention to that point. Dr. Osborn, Judy Le, please clarify for me one more time, if you may, how our instructional program relates directly to the proposed upgrades. Dr. Osborne will discuss that shortly. Thank you. Ellen, can you clarify exactly what you mean by science content changes compared to facility layout or how those things intersect? Could you explain your comment that the labs we're considering today have been envisioned for a decade already? Ellen Osborne will speak next and cover more specific points concerning potential renovations and updates impacting STEM teaching within ALBEMARLE COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS currently.  And how does that fit into what we learned from last night's strategic planning discussion where we covered four or five areas? That was part of one of them; looking at modernizing infrastructure was another item raised. So tying everything back together for our public and our board would probably be best coming from someone else's voice.\nelleno: Yes, sir. All right. With regard to how this fits into the vision for STEM in Albemarle County Public Schools, we envision a system where we engage all students in authentic problem-solving, critical thinking, collaboration, creativity"

The proposed lab designs prioritize flexibility and modularity, allowing teachers to adapt spaces according to changing curricular demands and pedagogies. This approach ensures that every student has equal access to engaging, high-quality STEM education."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "That's reassuring, Ellen. Flexibility and modularity will undoubtedly benefit our students. Given the emphasis on equity, I'd like to ask: Have we considered incorporating Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles into the design process to maximize accessibility and engagement for students with disabilities?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Judy, thank you for emphasizing UDL principles. That's a fantastic suggestion. Ensuring inclusive spaces requires careful attention to accessible design elements. Can we confirm whether our architectural partners are experienced in incorporating UDL principles and able to consult with our special education team during the design phase, Ellen or Graham?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Kate, I completely agree with Judy's concern for inclusive design. Indeed, we've made sure to select architectural partners with extensive experience in Universal Design for Learning principles and accessible design. They will work closely with our special education team to guarantee that the new laboratories and facilities meet the diverse needs of all students, including those with disabilities."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Great to hear confirmation of the architectural partner selection based on UDL expertise and commitment to collaborating with our special education team. Another aspect of equity and inclusion I believe warrants consideration: environmental justice implications. Are there opportunities for us to ensure the renovation process itself and final product aligns with sustainable practices and minimizes environmental impacts on local ecosystems?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Jonno, thank you for raising that very important issue. As Graham said earlier, we did incorporate green building concepts and sustainability features from the outset. Now that you mention it, Jonno, that could possibly encompass additional measures aimed towards mitigating the project's carbon footprint and ecological impact throughout its duration, which I think bears exploring further and seeking input from local experts."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Thank you Katrina. It seems prudent to explore ways to minimize our environmental footprint beyond just sustainable design choices. Considering the long-term operational efficiency benefits too, can we task our staff with researching cost-effective strategies to reduce waste generation, optimize energy consumption, and promote eco-friendly materials sourcing during the construction process? This information would help inform decision-making moving forward."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "I appreciate the thoughtful questions and discussions around ensuring equity, inclusivity, and environmental responsibility in our renovation plans. Let's indeed consider incorporating Universal Design for Learning principles and consult with our special education team to guarantee accessible design. Additionally, let's research and identify cost-effective strategies to reduce waste generation, optimize energy consumption, and promote eco-friendly materials sourcing during the construction process. We must balance our budget constraints while prioritizing environmentally responsible decisions. Moving forward, can we request an update on the project's estimated costs, taking into account these considerations, and discuss potential trade-offs or adjustments needed to achieve our goals within the allocated budget?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "David, excellent summary and direction! I concur that we should strike a balance between fiscal prudence and environmentally conscious decisions. In light of the added considerations discussed today, I propose requesting a revised project estimate with detailed breakdowns of the costs associated with each component. Perhaps we can also explore phasing options or potential partnerships that might offset some expenses without compromising our core objectives. Graham, can you provide a rough timeline for when we might receive such an updated estimate, so we can plan accordingly for future meetings and discussions?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Dave Oberg, my apologies if we left any uncertainty regarding that. I requested Ellen to brief everyone about it later tonight because her segment includes some comments related to both the scope as well as financial factors for the entire undertaking. Ms. Colson provided guidance previously on our current timeline. She will break down the construction components by phases.  At least three or four items need to be carried out in series rather than parallel, so please look ahead at upcoming board meetings since we need to stay on schedule with the CIP to keep funding aligned properly going forward. If you wish to review the CIP, check our website, which hosts relevant documents and meeting minutes from previous years' meetings. After receiving an updated project cost projection factoring in our newly stated concerns, it may be wise for the Board to hold a special meeting focused solely on this topic in order to fully deliberate and potentially make decisions.  Or perhaps we should allocate time slots across several meetings to address our growing list of action items and concerns. But in the meantime, I request our central office administration continue working diligently behind the scenes to refine details and prepare reports as necessary. Is there anything else anyone wants to say before ending the agenda item?"

  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Before we conclude, I'd like to emphasize that incorporating UDL principles, environmental sustainability, and social responsibility will not only benefit our students but also contribute to a more equitable and thriving community. I'll provide a comprehensive briefing on the project's scope, timelines, and financial aspects later tonight, addressing your requests for updated estimates and phasing options. Meanwhile, I recommend that our administrative team continues refining the project details, considering the valuable feedback and suggestions shared today. By doing so, we'll ensure that our renovation project not only enhances STEM instruction and student learning but also sets a positive precedent for environmentally conscious and socially responsible development in our district."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Thank you, Ellen, for your thorough response and proactive approach. Given the complexity of this project and the importance of balancing competing priorities, I suggest we dedicate a future meeting exclusively to discussing the project's updated costs, phasing, and potential trade-offs. In preparation, could you distribute the revised estimate and supporting documentation to us at least one week prior to that meeting? This will allow sufficient time for review, analysis, and thoughtful deliberation. Additionally, I propose inviting key stakeholders, including teachers, administrators, and community members, to participate in this discussion and share their insights. With transparent communication and collective input, we can ensure an informed, collaborative decision-making process that ultimately serves the best interests of our students and community."
