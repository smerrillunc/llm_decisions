    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.2: High School Renovation Project - The board will consider approval of funding for major facility improvements at the high school, including building four new science laboratories and repairing the athletic fields. The science lab construction is projected to cost $1,240,400 spread over four years, while athletic field repairs are included in the same package. These upgrades aim to improve STEM instruction and student access to safe extracurricular facilities.. Who would like to start?"

    "content": "Thank you, Mr. Paige. As we discuss the renovation project, let's not forget why we're here: to better serve our students. I'm particularly interested in how the renovations align with state and national standards. Can staff provide clarification on what specific safety features the athletic field improvements will entail, as well as any potential adjustments to accommodate diverse accessibility needs across all student groups? Additionally, how does this budget allocation support the achievement of our educational priorities for equity-driven results? And if possible, please also explain whether there have been adjustments based on emerging design and other factors and can we see it laid out by phase and timeframe.  This question really relates to your point about STEM instruction and a holistic approach that includes all students' experiences, which must be aligned with their career choices later. We are preparing young adults for the future but we need to keep them healthy today as we do that and I think some of the challenges we've seen lately related to environmental issues, which you'll find with our track, actually, with rainwater that we could collect that and make sure that the water table has enough, but not overflow from that and perhaps even provide a new way of water delivery into the stadium. I know the board was briefed on this during previous planning discussions, but I want to understand more about where each project phase stands regarding phasing because I believe in order for us to continue to talk about these things we've got to lay them out one step ahead so that people have confidence in the process."

    "content": "Ms. Carlson has a great deal of questions for her final question, thank you Dr. Johnson Alcarr. If we can start first. Mr. McMichael did you wish to address those points raised by Dr. O'Callaghin on diversity, equity, access to green spaces by students and also the field lighting? Or might we ask Coach Colson to say something on both. Or maybe she already talked about. But I think she mentioned having some of her colleagues around her who were going to speak with her. So we should let me call upon all individuals with answers that aren't from Ms. Coleson. There may be additional information provided within the PowerPoint presentation as they address the next part of our questions so let me just briefly summarize: how those items fit under health and nutrition and mental health. Then Ms. Johnson said she wanted it by individual sections. She was wondering when the two areas of the science room will open. It's part of a bigger goal. You don't expect those renovations to be ready until October, right. It takes up more space down below. Are these the last classrooms which will come online in November. Now, I do have a timeline for the entire construction plan starting in May 2008. All five components have now reached a status of fully funded, approved or submitted to city planning that you have had full presentations since January, then in response to a request from the planning commission. That is my request to be put in our packet. Do Dr. Aculin or Mr. Johnson or anyone else wish to give an update? It just seems like now would be good, Mr. Johnson and Ms. Coleston, for Ms. Coleston at least to offer her overview slide, which explains the current standing of the phasing of each component, and then perhaps a brief explanation by you too and Coach Colson. The main challenge in getting this out is making our schedule work and making the budget work, working within that constraint and getting the best bang for our buck for our budget that money comes from a mix of funding sources or local funds, capital improvement program dollars and fundraising for the science labs in particular that came out at $1 million per year, but it didn't stay on a straight line. What has happened over the past couple of months and I'd be happy to take off our mask in a second. I apologize, sir. Is there anything, Kate, at least I would appreciate having a summary or just"

    "content": "Yes, Mr. Page, I think we're trying to make sense of all the moving parts on this massive project and its impact on student learning and safety. I recommend starting with the phased plan to visualize the entire process. Coach Colson and I can walk through it together so there's clarity around the timeline for the science laboratory completion, the expected October opening, the phasing of athletic field repairs, and how we prioritize accessibility for all student groups. With Coach Colson's insight on health concerns and athletic infrastructure, we can provide an integrated perspective on how these renovations serve multiple objectives. From a financial lens, I can review the breakdown of funding sources, timelines, and expense forecasts. Let's create a visual framework so our stakeholders and the public can grasp the enormity and nuances of this undertaking. Is there agreement to proceed in this manner? Thank you."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "OK. What we can see is the big picture and then ask questions after you finish. I do have a series of questions based on the different areas that were set apart, but if Ms. Acuff would like the first section on student learning outcomes, that I certainly can give you a chance to go first there as well or perhaps go all the way through what you have first and then respond to all the questions.  What makes more sense to all of you? Go ahead and follow whatever procedure that seems most productive. First, tell us what that top one says, \"Student Wellness Focus\" before you click. Just click this link at the bottom to advance your slides. And then when I hear this message, click the slide again. It won't show unless it is advanced. OK. If someone knows how we can stop it, they please help. The whole thing stopped. Now they're going to use the web version. I believe everyone who used this interface may still use the web version and move forward by using the key. They tried both versions in case one didn't. OK, Ms. Acuff. We finally made it on there. Thanks again, Ms. Johnson. Thank you. I appreciate you all looking into the technology glitches that we encountered. To me, this seems to have a lot about instructional delivery, especially for the STEM disciplines. Now to be clear, I guess that we're looking at that very last item which shows, for instance, the middle school level of the track. When those are done. Does the timeline seem good for completing this fall when you anticipate finishing in October? How can we get better metrics when the goal is simply modernization and maintenance and we look at that to find data points and then we assess whether the money had an effect but there isn't data captured yet if we capture that data. What you're saying is once those improvements are in place, we will begin to identify ways that we can monitor progress toward those specific targets. And that could be attendance rates or it could be certain scores or benchmarks being met. There are several ways that we might try to measure that impact. Is that correct? We will continue to explore and develop some strategies for capturing metrics there. What do you have listed on the dashboard related to that in the spring when we talked about adding onto that dashboard? What type of metrics were proposed? Is that another possibility? Once again, thank you for bringing this up. But if you will have one"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Right, that did. On that note, before I forget, my intention was really to share my gratitude to both of you, not only because we've got this shared passion for wanting to do well and be excellent educators but also the patience with respect to tonight because it hasn't been easy. So the question I have tonight relates to what exactly you said earlier, Mr. Paige, regarding those first two items as well as a question on that dashboard because what I'm missing personally is what I have never seen laid out clearly anywhere. So let's just say for instance at all levels that we've got those two objectives here, \"Enhance instructional excellence,\" and \"ensure school and district safety\". And if I asked the next board meeting or three board meetings later, where I go down these four components, to give me the total cost across all of them, could you actually show them right on the same slide without a PowerPoint somewhere where the top line numbers add up across the columns? I want something such as safety and facilities and what's the total amount of money involved between all of those projects, the total number of people impacted, what the total estimated impact should be for improving student learning environment because we don't always capture those easily and you know what it will probably take to get all the components started because the biggest part is getting started. Then as that is updated, at any point in time as there are changes with respect to budgets or timelines, we might even have all the other ones so that everything is very clear. So, my question is, will that be possible? Could that be put into place, especially as you bring forward reports on individual projects, because it allows board members to ask more strategic questions and better align those decisions with long-term priorities. That is what I would be looking for. Thank you both again for your efforts tonight. I hope I helped somehow to make sure we better understand our own system. Thank you."

  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Ms. Callsen, I appreciate your recognition of the importance of having a unified, comprehensive overview of these projects. Your suggestion is spot on; providing a dashboard that integrates all project expenses, timelines, and expected outcomes will greatly enhance transparency and facilitate informed decision-making. I agree that having a centralized resource to track progress and allocate resources effectively is crucial. Perhaps we can work with administration to establish a standardized format for reporting updates, ensuring consistency and clarity for the board and the community. Dr. Page, I'd love your thoughts on implementing this request. Can we consider incorporating these indicators into our regular project updates to ensure seamless tracking?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Ms. Colson requested to get an overall view with the exact dollars spent per program area from that particular one, across each year of that multi-year plan. Our response is we can provide those elements.  As far as our budget forecast models,  I can certainly review  the budgeting side. Our operations manager will also receive this request, too. In fact, Ms. Johnston, maybe what would help too is as we update annually, you'll have all of that information incorporated within that annual update as well. One thing that has been very helpful when there have been project issues of significant magnitude is Ms. Johnson sending out those biweekly status reports with project managers' input so all parties are aware of the challenges in the areas in need of attention. That helps to keep that communication flowing around various sites as different projects are taking place. In addition to our construction site visits, receiving information in these formats will surely foster collaboration among our board members, staff, and the local community. Would you mind offering guidance on how frequently the full dashboards would ideally be updated given their size? Do you feel like every other week or maybe monthly would best serve you or possibly at quarterly intervals like most of our reports are structured right now.? I think it was quarterly and every time we meet. Every couple of weeks you get written notes, although Ms. Osborne sometimes shares her emails with everyone during discussions about that project. So even though not always in person, that way it is shared through email communication as well. That would be fine, Kate. Kate, does that sound accurate? So then as you can imagine we are doing it after every meeting since Kate shares anyway. That is not so difficult either. She emails her summary. Yes. No problem there. Or you get weekly notices with updates directly from Ms. Osborne who serves as the liaison so I don't have anything to do anymore.  Ms. Colson would prefer for us to have that report available on quarterly reports. So no matter what, we have it at least at each of our four quarterly presentations. But she would not wish for you to create one right away because in many cases much of the needed input is currently unknown. Is that right?. You are fine if we stick to quarterly updates. Thank you. Well, we shall see. That sounds simple enough for us. That is quite alright as long as this remains fluid.  And the last comment I have is while many items are here, hopefully, this coming"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I believe we're all aligned on the importance of transparently communicating key project details and impacts. I support Ms. Callsen's request for an integrated dashboard and am comfortable receiving updates at quarterly intervals, which will allow us to stay apprised of progress and make informed decisions. This framework should help streamline our collective efforts towards enhancing instruction, addressing safety concerns, and optimizing financial resources. Dr. Page, may we discuss whether our existing metrics are sufficient for gauging the effectiveness of our initiatives in driving positive change in student learning environments and outcomes? Are additional data points warranted to comprehensively evaluate project success?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "And this dashboard concept, I do think you are going to have enough info from Kate once we can answer your initial query. I mean the major component of that is just asking for a certain layout because I think we already provided information on the site visits. All right, and the site visit process, where they have a summary by month along with how long it was supposed to take for that project as opposed to its actual length of time, where you found problems and where some things were ahead of schedule. So I do think that is actually more than sufficient. If some additional components ever became necessary, you know, over some span of time we're already talking about the  next five years and so forth. We really have to adjust ourselves often based upon the reality of the school world and as well as that of Albemarle County, and you guys would continue to offer feedback as to what your needs were from this committee  and that's why what Ms. Acuff just said resonated with me as well. And yes, you've done it correctly by saying well, we could say at this point in time maybe you may want to begin thinking a little bit differently once you have these kinds of tools in your hands and seeing it, but you certainly haven't changed from being reactive to proactive because you were concerned about this issue in advance. And I think that in itself demonstrates that, I think, is a sign of good leadership and responsible stewardship and it makes sense too that some other things would come into play later on because a lot of this is going to depend upon your future conversations. It won't depend on our conversations today, it depends upon your future planning processes too. In terms of other factors, a major component of this process that has not yet taken place is, there hasn't been the development of formal plans related to science renovation projects, athletic improvements and all these programs like safety that you all wanted discussed. So that's another example of what's missing from that analysis that was initially presented. We can't possibly tell exactly what type of impact that would occur because in order to truly analyze that aspect, a more comprehensive project proposal is needed because we're moving further on, a whole number of these. That is why it was brought before you when it was brought to you, just in case you wanted to fund it all together versus in three separate segments. Because there are more things here than we know the impact of at the moment because these projects must be made"

  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I appreciate your insight, Mr. Page, and concur that refining the dashboard format and content will depend on ongoing assessment and feedback. Notably, I agree that our initial inquiry stems from a desire to ensure proactive planning rather than mere reactivity. Given that numerous variables, including the developing comprehensive project proposals, contribute to uncertainty regarding the exact impact of proposed investments, would it be possible to identify any potential \"early wins\" or specific aspects within the scope of these projects that might yield shorter-term benefits or tangible results, allowing us to iteratively refine our strategies as additional information becomes available?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Early benefits of whatever decision we reach? Now, let me mention two early examples that I'm sure of: the safety improvements for the track system. You remember last fall, the boys' cross country team experienced difficulties with home events because they didn't have their own field. One of the big ones, too, of course, that came up, is repairing the track and that was identified in Ms. Colson's document earlier this year that would be able to improve safety of conditions across the county pretty shortly with regards to that particular aspect. The same thing with that high jump area for Monticello High School. If approved, we'd be able to initiate that work quickly and have a positive impact without waiting on the full renovations. Two quick wins associated with safety repairs around the track systems. And in both instances the safety piece is there, also those facilities become something closer to what people have been hoping for in western and in the northern parts of Albemarle, that is a win now for  a shorter term benefit that would materialize and those are tied closely to your original queries and questions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Building upon Dr. Page's identification of potential \"early wins,\" I would like to highlight the significance of prioritizing projects with measurable short-term benefits, particularly those directly impacting student experiences and safety. By focusing on these initial successes, we can establish momentum for the broader initiative while continually assessing and refining our approaches as more information becomes available. This phased implementation will enable us to make data-informed decisions and allocate resources effectively, ultimately leading to enhanced STEM instruction and improved overall learning environments."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "That's an excellent point, Judy. By concentrating on these initial projects, which indeed offer tangible benefits and relatively rapid returns, we not only secure early successes but also create opportunities to reassess and adapt subsequent phases of the project based on the insights garnered from these initial initiatives. Additionally, this approach underscores our collective commitment to responsible resource allocation, ensuring that every dollar spent contributes meaningfully to enhancing student experiences and advancing academic achievement. Would our consultants provide some input regarding how best to prioritize these projects within each phase, taking into account considerations such as timelines, budget constraints, and potential synergies between individual components?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Absolutely, Kate. Our consultants can definitely provide guidance on project prioritization. To ensure alignment with our goals and values, I suggest we use a rubric that weighs factors such as urgency, impact on student learning, and feasibility. By doing so, we can objectively evaluate each project component and determine the most effective sequencing of our efforts. Additionally, this rubric can help us identify potential areas for cost savings or efficiencies, enabling us to maximize our budget while minimizing delays. What are everyone's thoughts on this approach?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I fully support Ellen's suggestion. Establishing a clear rubric will enable us to methodically assess each project element, facilitating a fair and transparent evaluation process that upholds our shared priorities and objectives. This structured approach will allow us to visualize the project landscape, identify interdependencies, and schedule accordingly. Furthermore, incorporating factors like feasibility and cost efficiency can lead to creative problem-solving, encouraging collaboration and innovation among our stakeholders. Can Ms. Osborne elaborate on the key performance indicators (KPIs) or metrics she envisions including in this rubric, to guarantee the evaluation criteria align with our strategic goals and desired outcomes?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, Kate. I'm happy to outline the KPIs we could consider for the rubric. Firstly, we should include metrics related to student experience, such as improved safety ratings, increased access to modernized learning spaces, and enhanced extracurricular opportunities. Secondly, we should incorporate measures of academic impact, like increases in STEM course enrollments, improvement in student proficiency rates, and growth in Advanced Placement or dual-enrollment participation. Finally, we should also include operational metrics, such as project timeline adherence, budget variance, and community engagement levels. By using a balanced set of KPIs, we'll ensure that our evaluation process remains holistic and aligned with our district's strategic plan. Does that sound reasonable to everyone?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Absolutely, Ms. Osborne.  Your suggested KPIs provide an ideal starting point for structuring our evaluation rubric. In addition to these critical elements, I propose that we also weigh projects' ability to drive long-term maintenance savings, promote equity, and showcase flexibility for future educational innovation. Furthermore, since public engagement played a vital role in informing this proposal, integrating citizen engagement metrics could enhance accountability and foster continued transparency throughout the process. Are there other key factors the committee thinks we should consider to develop this comprehensive evaluation tool?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I appreciate the thoughtful suggestions provided thus far. Since we're dealing with numerous variables and competing priorities, I think it's crucial to stress-test our evaluation rubric by applying different weightages to the various criteria mentioned. Then we'll gain insight into whether certain projects become higher priorities under distinct scenarios. We mustn't overlook the importance of stakeholder input, especially teachers, students, and parents who interact closely with these facilities. By engaging them during our rubric development, we'll strengthen our final product. Is there general agreement on adopting a flexible and iterative approach, recognizing that as new data emerges, adjustments to the rubric may prove necessary? Should we engage our construction management partners for feedback at the end of July? We need this kind of support. What's the earliest possible date, after this session tonight, where we can all gather as a whole board and further discuss and refine the KPI rubric collectively prior to receiving the updated data at the very end of July when the consultant comes back, giving them further guidance before then? It seems like late June is a rough estimate for us gathering back together with this refined group in place. If the date lands at the end of June for reviewing and working on the updated set of numbers, we should also come armed with the rubric that we had used for evaluation purposes once that is more refined. Does that seem feasible? Any other ideas on engaging stakeholders more formally while continuing the planning process over the summer months? Do we want to continue our discussion next time and just agree and set dates here tonight? Or do we want to set those dates tonight and then proceed forward? It sounds to me like a date for a work session at the beginning of August for that is coming together well for almost everybody else who has said yes to attending. With all agreed-upon dates scheduled for those work sessions later on in the summer, if there's anything else, please raise your hands. We've got late July. We'll get the consultant stuff in. We'll bring a second set of information back in late July after the consultant provides those refinements. We're planning the work session in late June and one in early August, and then probably we need a regular school board meeting in September, as we come back and look at budgets with fresh eyes and new knowledge about the situation for that fiscal period. That gives us three specific events spaced evenly in there that cover off what we need going into the start of the next school year. So, this"

    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Yes, Katrina, I concur that a flexible, iterative approach is essential in developing our evaluation rubric. By stressing test and refining it through varied scenarios, we'll ensure its robustness. Incorporating stakeholder input from diverse perspectives will undoubtedly enrich our decision-making. As for the proposed timeline, I find the late-June and early-August work sessions suitable for our committee. These milestones will allow us to make substantial progress without overwhelming our members. In between those meetings, we can gather additional insights from our consultants and engage further with community stakeholders. Come September, we'll be well-positioned to deliberate on budgets with fresh information and informed minds. Would anyone like to propose any additional dates or adjustments before we solidify this plan?"

To build upon David's thoughts, considering multiple stakeholder groups' inputs will foster a richer understanding of our project's implications. It's essential to strike a balance between ensuring meaningful community engagement and maintaining a timely project progression. Let's establish clear guidelines for stakeholder outreach and communication, ensuring their voices are heard throughout our decision-making journey. Shall we delegate task forces or subcommittees to focus on these specific aspects, guaranteeing inclusivity and effective stakeholder involvement throughout the process?"

    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Excellent suggestion, Judy. Designating subcommittees for stakeholder engagement would help streamline the process, allowing each subgroup to hone in on particular aspects while keeping the overall effort cohesive. For example, one subcommittee could manage community outreach, whereas another might oversee gathering teacher and staff feedback. As chair of this committee, I'd volunteer to serve on an oversight body coordinating these efforts and synthesizing findings for the entire board's consideration. Let's discuss how many subcommittees would suffice and define clear goals and expectations for each. Who among us might be willing to take on leadership roles within these subcommittees?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "I completely agree with Kate's proposal to establish subcommittees focused on stakeholder engagement. By doing so, we'll not only ensure a thorough and inclusive process but also facilitate efficient collaboration among committee members. Three subcommittees could be formed, covering community outreach, teacher/staff feedback, and student/parent input. Each subcommittee should have a clear mandate, and their leaders should report back to the oversight body, which I'm happy to join alongside Kate. This structure will enable us to hear diverse voices, incorporate valuable insights, and ultimately create a well-rounded evaluation rubric."

  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thank you, Ellen. Your suggested breakdown of subcommittees makes perfect sense. Having clearly defined tasks and leaders for each will indeed facilitate smoother collaboration and reporting back to the oversight body. As we finalize our subcommittee structures, let's ensure representation from diverse groups, such as faculty, students, administration, and community members. This broad representation will lend credibility to our process and outcome. Are there any volunteers to lead or participate in the respective subcommittees? Shall we discuss potential candidates or put out an open call to the broader community for interested participants?"
  },

    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Before proceeding to discussing volunteers, I propose we briefly outline the role, duties, and desired composition for each subcommittee, clarifying their objectives and expected outcomes. Furthermore, having a concise description of the subcommittees and their responsibilities will empower Kate to guide our outreach efforts effectively.  Does everyone concur with this course of action, establishing these key details first?  Then we may follow up with identifying potential leaders and members across each subgroup?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Absolutely, Jon. I wholeheartedly endorse establishing clear descriptions of each subcommittee's purpose, roles, and deliverables before moving forward with recruitment. This clarity will help prevent duplication of efforts and ensure seamless communication among the committees and the oversight body. Additionally, these descriptions will provide a clear foundation for stakeholders to understand the scope of their participation. I'll summarize these definitions in writing, and we can review them during our late-June work session.
