    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.2: High School Renovation Project - The board will consider approval of funding for major facility improvements at the high school, including building four new science laboratories and repairing the athletic fields. The science lab construction is projected to cost $1,240,400 spread over four years, while athletic field repairs are included in the same package. These upgrades aim to improve STEM instruction and student access to safe extracurricular facilities.. Who would like to start?"

    "content": "I'd be happy to open up. Thank you Mr. Paige. Last month we had a chance to get out into the classrooms at the high school, look at the current condition of our science facilities, and really think about how important it is that we invest in bringing those resources up to date for students today. We've all agreed that student experience is very central to what it is we're doing in schools.  How much safer can these renovations make the buildings for both staff and students, but then also thinking about how that actually enhances the opportunities students have in their classes. So, my first question is, as we're looking at phase one of this project, what exactly does the timeline look like for those specific elements of that overall project? Is there a rough idea of how long it'll take before the new labs are available for kids to use? And can someone tell us the current state of the safety considerations within the existing science classrooms? Are they a health concern now, or just less than ideal from an instructional perspective? Thanks."

    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Good morning John. That's Jon Alcareo. Ms. Colson, why don't you explain to Dr. Alcareo and the board generally speaking where we currently stand with that timeline and specifically what safety features in science labs are your primary concerns right now? Okay so the phased part is key because we do want to do them simultaneously, because you are going to need to take offline each of those different science rooms. Right. And so we have a tentative timeline for doing this work over the next three summers. So starting after this academic year when summer comes in June, that's when we could take off the first set of science rooms and do that round of renovations. The second summer we could take off the second set of rooms, finish them, take off the last set the third summer, finish them by the end of the third summer, so there are many components to our safety concerns regarding the current science labs in the condition they were built back during construction of the high school and later. So if you start thinking in terms of storage of chemicals, ventilation within those areas, lack of equipment available with electrical outlets being scarce, not having a sink per room, which is something needed per lab, that is our focus within those science labs in order to make sure our teachers have more modern and updated materials to teach from while keeping our students safe. But please know that we cannot leave here tonight without mentioning how grateful I am to everyone involved in making this project happen when considering the state of our facilities, student experiences and learning outcomes, and, above all else, teacher and pupil safety around those spaces. Our school should give every opportunity for the children in our care to flourish. And for far too long, they haven't been able to benefit from the kinds of spaces that truly support top-notch teaching practice and research as we want to instill in them. It's been far too long that we let this area go unattended to in some ways and neglecting the way these facilities have been in. Thank you both again. Thank you to Ms. Johnson for all she did in helping provide the information. Does anyone have anything else from Ms. Colson or from Kate Akauf and her presentation. All right, thanks a lot. And thank you both. That was all right for this piece right now. So Judy, any other questions at the present moment based on those statements before we ask people to share their perspectives publicly? Thank you. Thank you. Go ahead."

    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Yes, thank you, Graham.  I appreciate Ms. Colson's detailed explanation of the project timeline and safety concerns. I understand that the phased renovation plan aims to minimize disruptions to STEM instruction, but I'm concerned about the impact of taking offline multiple science rooms simultaneously. Can you clarify how the district plans to ensure that students still have access to adequate laboratory space and educational resources throughout the renovation process? Additionally, what provisions are being made to support teachers in adapting to these changes and maintaining continuity in their curriculum delivery? Thank you."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "So maybe you want to speak on one thing initially. To address this issue, we've already begun conversations involving teachers from each department who've given great feedback that will help shape this strategy. They've proposed that certain portions of that year may well be more difficult in one science versus another science class, depending on the nature of experiments being carried out at that point in time. Because one experiment would certainly be easier to transport into the temporary modular setup, whereas it may be a bit more challenging if you were carrying out an experiment where it was important to work at stations such as physics stations. I don't think physics could be easily transferred to a mobile environment if all they're working at are table stations in there. As stated, the plan would be to keep chemistry and physics and even earth sciences together, since they need specialized tools in their classroom environments. I want to follow up on this idea on the modular setting which will serve as a swing space until the classrooms are renovated. Then, you have three fully functional science rooms, but you must know these aren't just for science. Those modular classrooms would offer enough space, allowing students and educators to stay connected and continue delivering lesson content as needed during phases two and three, ensuring that students are still exposed to quality lab experiences.  As they complete their renovations, they can return to the main high school building. This has really worked well elsewhere. So the whole goal behind this renovation process would have to align itself with that phasing plan in this proposal. We've never experienced anything better than staying organized and methodical through all parts. Do you still have any additional points on that element, Judy? Thank you, too, to Ms. Colson again. Did Mr. Osborne have a hand raised at the moment? Yeah, he did. All right, Ellen. Please go. You had one question right on the other things you brought up that I thought about immediately."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thanks, I wanted to talk about how we will maintain a focus on sustainability within those new classroom designs. What types of strategies and technologies are being researched as possibilities in the design phase that would also help our environmental footprint locally at Albemarle High School? I agree that the focus needs to be on the importance of these projects improving student learning outcomes, but it seems like incorporating sustainable practices in line with a broader vision will be crucial to this work as well."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Katrinea,  Thank you for bringing up such an essential topic. While ensuring student learning outcomes and teacher satisfaction are critical aspects, we shouldn't overlook the broader environmental implications of our actions. Sustainability is indeed crucial to consider in this project, and I believe our architects will incorporate green technology and materials whenever feasible in the design. For example, using recycled materials in the new buildings, optimizing natural lighting, utilizing energy-efficient appliances, and possibly incorporating solar panels could all contribute to reducing our ecological footprint. Involving our students in this decision-making process will also be beneficial in fostering environmental stewardship and encouraging responsible citizenship. By promoting sustainability, we'll enhance student learning outcomes and help our community thrive. Would love to hear more from Ms. Johnson on any specific strategies being explored."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thank you, David. I appreciate your emphasis on sustainability and student involvement. Katrinea, I'd like to build upon your question by asking about the potential for incorporating green roofs or outdoor learning spaces in the design. These features not only promote environmental sustainability but also offer unique opportunities for interdisciplinary learning and experiential education. Has the design team considered incorporating such elements, and if so, how might they be integrated into the overall project plan?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thanks for taking it further, Judy, and I love the concept you mentioned of including outdoor green spaces for interdisciplinary learning. Ms. Acuff, I wonder if there's already planning to utilize some components of that green infrastructure into this project? Are any local groups or entities going to participate or guide in discussions in terms of what can be done along these lines? And then relatedly, I'd also appreciate more clarity around what stakeholder engagement strategies are currently envisioned during the rest of the design phase, inclusive of teachers, students, parents, neighborhood residents, and the general public to garner ongoing input for this vision. How does this evolve beyond simply having open house meetings and more towards active partnerships with stakeholders? So thanks a lot. Thanks for letting me follow up again."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Yes, I do want to acknowledge that Katrinea, we're actually very much interested in exploring ways to integrate green infrastructure and environmental sustainability throughout the project. So it's excellent timing because we had several partners reach out who want to partner with us for instance on things such as stormwater management. One such opportunity is the county stormwater program working directly with schools on green infrastructure project designs. If it is a fit, it'll certainly align well with both green roof initiatives and creating educational opportunities around environmental stewardship and conservation. Now while this wouldn't provide a perfect overlap between science labs and green infrastructure per se, that connection could provide real-world examples for many different classes and activities when incorporating concepts of environmental literacy, ecology, engineering, and scientific inquiry. We'll try to capitalize on chances to get our kids involved in making environmentally conscious decisions while providing meaningful lessons, something they won't soon forget. And moving onto your second request, on engaging our community. I couldn't agree more. The community plays an integral role here in shaping a successful project that meets everyone's needs. Over the next few weeks, our architect firm will lead focus group sessions consisting of students, staff members, the PTOs as well as surrounding neighbors and community leaders discussing what their vision for the new facilities should look like. During spring of '24, we'll then open up these focus groups a little bit more and expand participation with even larger town hall events. This will provide opportunities to engage in deeper discussions over the next 12 to 14 months. Our aim will be engaging the full range of stakeholders across multiple touchpoints to garner diverse perspectives. Thank you again. Does that answer both parts of your query? It looks like David had a request now."

  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Kate, thank you for addressing Katrinea's questions and providing insight into the plans for incorporating green infrastructure and community engagement. I appreciate the approach you outlined for involving various stakeholders in the design process. Considering the potential for green roofs and outdoor learning spaces, I'd like to explore another aspect of sustainability \u2013 accessibility and equity. Have we given thought to ensuring that these new facilities, particularly the outdoor spaces, are accessible to all students, including those with disabilities? Additionally, are there any plans to incorporate Universal Design for Learning principles in the design of these spaces to maximize inclusivity and flexibility for diverse learners?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "David, absolutely we must prioritize equity and accessibility in designing these new facilities. Indeed, both green infrastructure and outdoor learning spaces must ensure equal access for every student regardless of their abilities. The architectural firm has been instructed to integrate ADA compliance in the initial design phases. Additionally, we're committed to surpassing minimum standards through adopting Universal Design for Learning principles to foster optimal accessibility, flexibility, and inclusion. As part of the focus groups and town halls, we'll invite experts specializing in accessible design and UDL to ensure we meet the diverse needs of our student population and staff. Another layer of consideration includes reviewing and revising our existing transition plans to guarantee that inclusive environments are developed with all users in mind. We must also ensure our maintenance protocols account for maintaining accessible features. Thank you for highlighting this pivotal aspect of our responsibilities to serve each student fairly and equitably. Jon, did you have a comment?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Yes, thank you, Kate. I appreciate David raising this important point about ensuring accessibility and equity in the new facilities. As David mentioned, it's essential to prioritize inclusivity in the design of both indoor and outdoor spaces. The commitment to Universal Design for Learning principles is vital in creating optimal learning conditions for students with varying abilities and needs. In line with this focus on equity, I believe it would be helpful to include representatives from our Special Education department and other relevant stakeholders in the design process to ensure that their expertise informs the final product. This collaboration will enable us to create truly inclusive spaces where every student can succeed. I'm excited to see how these efforts unfold. Ms. Callison?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "To build upon this thought stream a bit more with this notion of collaboration, we need to discuss how to hold ourselves accountable in terms of actualizing UDL principles and maximizing accessibility within budgetary constraints, so some level of cost sensitivity is required. What cost-benefit analysis methods were used to identify the right balance and ultimately inform budget decisions? There were several slides shown initially that had a breakout. A whole host of items went away, just not being funded at this time because they weren't high-priority areas or were too expensive. Do we have a way to determine if costs of certain design elements outweighed benefits provided so that we made our investment the most effective possible under these limited circumstances? Lastly, for the record, let me just confirm one last detail that didn't appear in the slide deck -- Will construction timelines accommodate teacher professional development ahead of introducing new equipment, labs, and spaces to support STEM instruction, and perhaps even cross-curricular applications as well as opportunities for inter-district training collaborations?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Kate and Jon, I appreciate your emphasis on prioritizing equity and accessibility in the design process. Ensuring that our new facilities are inclusive and adaptable to diverse learners is crucial. Katrina, your points regarding cost-benefit analysis and budget decisions are well-taken. Transparency is essential in determining the most effective use of our resources. I propose that we review the cost-benefit analysis methodology used and provide a detailed breakdown of the trade-offs made during the budgeting process. Regarding teacher professional development, it's imperative that we allocate sufficient time and resources for our educators to familiarize themselves with new equipment, labs, and spaces before introducing them to students. I recommend adding a provision to the project timeline specifically dedicated to teacher training and support. Let's work together to ensure a seamless integration of these new facilities into our STEM curriculum. Judy, would you like to add anything to this discussion?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "I'd like to reinforce the importance of equity and accessibility throughout this project, emphasizing the value of stakeholder input and cost-sensitive decision-making. Given the emphasis on Universal Design for Learning principles, I suggest inviting experts in inclusive design to present best practices and case studies on successfully integrating accessible features into educational settings. This knowledge sharing could enrich our focus groups and town hall discussions, ensuring we set realistic expectations and achieve optimal results within budgetary constraints."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "That sounds like an excellent suggestion, Judy. Inviting experts in inclusive design will help us leverage best practices in this area, as well as provide an opportunity to share examples of successful implementations that demonstrate the value of investing in accessibility and UDL principles. Ellen, regarding your proposal to review the cost-benefit analysis methodology, I think that's a great idea. By being transparent about our decision-making processes and offering clear explanations of the trade-offs, we can instill greater confidence in our stakeholders and foster a sense of shared ownership in this project. Going forward, I propose establishing regular check-ins to address ongoing concerns about accessibility, equity, and cost management while keeping the focus on student-centered instructional innovation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "And one thing that may facilitate such transparency could be to have separate threads for specific aspects or components of the project instead of having these very large documents. This way we could better track the history, whether it's related to sustainability or accessibility, as these topics emerge throughout the renovation process. With more focused documentation of this nature, it will then become much easier for people who might only care about specific aspects of the projects to still get informed updates without having to dig through massive documents.  So that's something else for our project team to consider. Are there any other comments now?  Mr. Page, I know that your hand was up. Did you wish to make another remark?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Yes. Thank you, Chair Callison. The emphasis placed by Dr. Osborne, Mr. Acuff, and others here tonight on incorporating principles of Universal Design for Learning is gratifying and absolutely necessary as a key factor in designing spaces that meet the unique needs of our entire student body. When possible, we should seek out professionals experienced in accessible design, and incorporate voices from diverse stakeholders, including but not limited to those in special education. I encourage the school board to remain vigilant in monitoring our project team's efforts towards this end. The importance cannot be overstated, and we owe nothing short of our collective best effort in delivering facilities which empower, engage, and inspire students of all backgrounds, interests, and talents. I am fully committed, alongside my colleagues, to the goal of realizing the educational vision presented earlier in this meeting. Thank you. I think David had his hand up next. David, do you want to make a comment? Or are you good? I don't mean to cut him off. I know he's been thinking about things, too. Okay, go ahead, Dave. I'll hush, and we'll give the floor back to you. You've earned it. Go ahead.  Dave, take over. I'm done with my piece. Dave. Sorry for interrupting."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thank you, Graham.  I appreciate your emphasis on the importance of Universal Design for Learning and seeking out diverse voices in the design process. To build upon Kate's suggestion of using separate threads for tracking project components, I propose creating a publicly accessible dashboard that provides real-time updates on the project's progress, including budget allocations, design decisions, and community engagement activities. This dashboard could also feature a feedback mechanism, allowing stakeholders to submit suggestions and concerns throughout the renovation process. By increasing transparency and encouraging ongoing community involvement, we can ensure that our renovated facilities truly serve the needs of all students and embody the values of equity, accessibility, and inclusivity."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I agree that having a publicly accessible dashboard would promote transparency and allow for continuous community engagement. In fact, I'd like to suggest that we develop a framework outlining metrics for measuring the success of our inclusive design approach. We need to track how our investments yield benefits for students, particularly underrepresented populations. By doing so, we'll have data to support future decision-making and resource allocation while celebrating student successes along the way.  As we move forward, it's crucial to keep our focus on student outcomes at the heart of every stage of this project. I'm eager to continue refining our strategies around teacher professional development and ensuring proper training for both existing faculty members as well as potential new hires attracted by these innovative learning environments. How will we structure our plan for staffing and recruitment so that they align with our goals of providing inclusive, adaptive learning experiences for all students?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Kate, your suggestion on developing a framework for measuring the success of our inclusive design approach resonates deeply with me. It's essential to quantify the impact of our investment on student outcomes, especially for underrepresented populations. Regarding staffing and recruitment, I recommend establishing a task force comprising educators, administrators, and HR representatives to identify the skills and competencies required to effectively teach in our reimagined spaces. By doing so, we can craft a comprehensive staffing strategy that attracts and retains talented educators capable of leveraging our cutting-edge facilities to deliver high-quality instruction tailored to diverse learning styles."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "David, I couldn't agree more about forming a task force to define the necessary skills and competencies for our educators. Additionally, I believe it's crucial to involve our local universities and community colleges in the discussion, exploring opportunities for partnership and collaboration that would enable pre-service and in-service teachers to gain experience in these innovative learning environments. This would benefit both our district and the higher education institutions by fostering a pipeline of talent equipped to meet the evolving needs of our students. What role do you envision for industry partners in this process, potentially leveraging their expertise to develop targeted professional development offerings or providing internship opportunities for aspiring educators?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Kate, your idea of engaging local universities and community colleges is spot on. Industry partners can indeed play a vital role in augmenting our professional development efforts. I foresee them providing valuable insights into emerging trends, technologies, and best practices in STEM fields, which our educators can leverage to inform their teaching methods. Additionally, industry partners could offer mentorship programs, internships, or job shadowing opportunities, allowing our students to connect theoretical concepts to real-world applications. This collaboration could also lead to the creation of customized training modules, empowering our educators to integrate industry-relevant skills and knowledge into their curricula. By bridging the gap between academia and industry, we can create a more agile, responsive educational system that prepares our students for an ever-changing workforce."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "That's exactly what I had in mind, David - industry partners serving as catalysts for innovation in our professional development initiatives. Furthermore, by integrating industry perspectives into our curriculum design, we can ensure that our graduates possess the skills and adaptability needed to thrive in the modern workforce. I'd like to take it one step further by considering ways to engage local industry leaders in our project advisory committee, enabling us to tap into their expertise during the planning phases and receive input on our facility designs, program development, and instructional approaches. With their guidance, we can validate that our investments align with regional workforce demands, ultimately increasing the return on our investment for students and the broader community alike. Graham, did you want to add anything to this thread?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Ellen, why don't I just acknowledge, if Kate's through, that we've got some really smart people who care and who bring different perspectives and insights to the table. And one thing I was going to say about Dr. Acuff's question about what might be some challenges if not opportunities here, when she mentioned that our buildings may last 50 years, but our programs might last five.  So it sounds like something Jon could have said, given his background, was that the ability to repurpose flexible space, as opposed to a fixed asset tied to a specific function or set of functions, is very much an artform. We want to provide adaptable physical assets to respond to changing programming and curricular needs. And then to address Katrina's question and to close, yes, these spaces certainly should incorporate flexible furniture types that we can see now even if we may want to add more. There needs to be a lot of flexibility there, so that's just sort of what comes to mind, but it may help answer David's request that was originally put on the list for this evening. But I think those observations are correct. All right, thank you, Ellen. Do any other folks need any time from Dr. Oberg?   Right. Very quickly then, this board, or at least its majority, hopes and believes this is likely to be a two phase project. A first project being for some period of months, and then hopefully returning to design, where you're working again on your site acquisition and architectural plans, working on finalizing things at the end of the academic year in '23, for construction work beginning in '24 and lasting perhaps three years, so that hopefully in August '27, we will stand prepared once again to be accepting bids that could be opened September 28th to start 2027 classes with newly designed science laboratory classrooms to the south,  the athletic stadium complex completed, with those elements described with some urgency due to safety issues and such, ready to initiate school that fall.  This has obviously required many steps along the way. But in terms of major milestones for now, the ones we see that are really key have been mentioned already. This includes revising our capital improvement plan for '22 and '23; preparing our annual state funding request related to school infrastructure projects, to include our capital improvement program, the annual grant which is submitted, all right in preparation for this project, so I'm sorry. The motion to approve our minutes"
