    "comment": "It appears we all agree with this motion so far based upon what has transpired during tonight's meeting.\nI am very pleased about how much time was spent discussing these items at committee meetings,\nand then again here today by staff. And thank you also to Dr. Haas\nfor his input into each item individually when requested from him. So after careful consideration,\nit seems like everything aligns properly now according to Virginia code and Albemarle County Public School policies.\nSo therefore, I do not see any reason why there would be an objection raised against adopting them officially through action taken by us.\nAnd if they were adopted without change later down the road, which could happen because things can always come up unexpectedly,\nthen those changes may require additional approval actions being done by us too depending on their nature.\nBut hopefully nothing else comes out other than just some minor adjustments perhaps related to wording only.\nIn summary, I'm glad everyone agrees thusfar regarding adoption of Policy GCBD Professional Staff Compensation Procedural Plan;\nPolicy GCPA-N Licensed Personnel Reduction In Force; Policy DJH Capital Planning Cash Flow Projection Formulation;\nPolicy EFA Educational Facilities Specifications; Policy CL System Of Schools Operation To Be Pursued By The Division;\nPolicy CKA Title One Parental Right-To-Know Information On Teacher Qualifications And Skills;\nPolicy CHD Solicitations And Acceptance Of Gifts Or Donations From Private Sources For Instructional Purposes Only;\nPolicy DIA Reproduction And Distribution Of Copyrighted Materials; Policy DK Use Of Purchasing Cards;\nPolicy DN Annual Operating Budget Disbursements Expenditures Over $50,000; Policy DO Management Of Funds;\nPolicy DP Auditing Services; Policy JFCC Student Wellness Program; Policy JOA Bookstore Financial Procedures;\nPolicy KQ Communicating With Parents Through Electronic Mail Via Our Official Email Service Provider;\nPolicy KN Smoking Tobacco Products Ban At All Times While Upon Any Portion Of A School Bus Owned Operated By Us;\nor leased/contracted by ACPS As Well As Each Facility That Is Either Owned Directly Or Indirectly Under Lease Agreement Effective Immediately Once Adopting This Change Into Local Board Policies;\nOr Even Rented Temporarily When Needed Like During Field Trips Away From Home Campus Locations Within Their Own District Boundaries But Not Limited Therein Alone Because They Are Always Representing Us No Matter Where Located Geographically Speaking Globally Around Earth Including International Travel Destinations Too If Applicable Hereby Requiring Compliance Everywhere Without Exception Regardless How"
