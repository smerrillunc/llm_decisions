    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.3: Technology Plan - The board will review a proposal to expand digital learning access by providing Chromebooks to every high school student. This initiative is estimated to cost $10,000 annually for devices, maintenance, and licensing. The program is designed to ensure equitable access to technology, support blended learning, and prepare students with digital skills for college and career readiness.. Who would like to start?"

    "content": "I believe we've all seen the impact of our students who were unable to fully participate last spring because they lacked home internet access. By investing in these devices, we are prioritizing equity as well as enhancing academic opportunities for all learners. I'd love to hear what Katrina has prepared for us today about this new technology plan."

    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Jon Alcareo talked about it already, and I'll be sharing more slides regarding financial considerations. First off, the proposal covers annual costs not just for high schools, but also for middle and elementary schools. We're recommending $100,000 be budgeted for devices and another $150,000 in ongoing operational funds from federal ESSER funds, so that makes up the total. However, if the full program gets implemented right away, it could actually reduce costs further down the line while improving access for kids and increasing their engagement at every age level."

    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thank you, Katrina, for the detailed breakdown of the proposal. I'm intrigued by your point about potential long-term cost savings. As we discuss equity, I want to emphasize that it's crucial we consider not only device distribution but also internet accessibility for our students' homes. Have we explored possibilities for partnering with local internet service providers to offer affordable options for our families?"

  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "David Oberg raises an important concern. So far we have not looked into specific partnerships with ISPs, as that part depends on the county government, yet another reason why tonight's meeting serves as an opportunity for input before formalizing next steps in our process. It's possible this might also tie into countywide initiatives going forward. One other thing worth mentioning here may also get affected by any state or federal infrastructure bills currently under consideration. What we do know is that it is crucial for us to keep considering those things as we try to provide those internet connections when families need them most."

    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "I appreciate Katrina's thoroughness and David's emphasis on internet accessibility. As we move forward, let's ensure we prioritize collaboration between our district, local government, and private entities to secure affordable internet options for our students' families. Additionally, I suggest we explore possibilities for mobile hotspots or alternative connectivity solutions to address immediate needs. In the interest of equity, we must consider the entirety of our students' digital experience, including both devices and internet access."

    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Judy Le correctly underscores the significance of a comprehensive approach focusing on not just devices but complete digital accessibility. That aligns perfectly with our values promoting social equity, especially now that we have received clear information concerning overall projected costs of the proposed digital expansion. To guide future actions, my question is how we should establish specific metrics around ensuring equity within device rollout and measuring its impact throughout our diverse learner populations.\n```\nUser: grahampage\n```"

    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Kate Cuff brings up a vital point regarding the need for metrics to measure equity and impact. To build upon that, I propose that we form a task force consisting of representatives from each school level, as well as community stakeholders, to develop and track key performance indicators (KPIs) that address device access, internet connectivity, and ultimately, student outcomes. This collaborative effort will enable us to refine our approach, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions to ensure the success of this initiative."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I completely agree with Ellen Osborne about establishing a representative task force. This group will help create a detailed framework to evaluate how effectively we are addressing digital inequities across different demographics, socio-economic levels, and learning abilities. Their findings can then serve as benchmarks for evaluating our progress toward delivering equitable learning experiences through this digital expansion effort. Furthermore, this diverse team could also provide critical insights for adjusting our implementation strategy mid-stream if needed. I truly appreciate Ellen's suggestion. Can we add this idea to the motion we're considering?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Absolutely, Kate! I'm glad you support the idea. I propose we include language in the motion to establish a task force, comprising representatives from each school level, community stakeholders, and district administrators, to develop and monitor KPIs for equity and impact. This will ensure our digital expansion efforts remain focused on promoting social equity, addressing disparities, and enhancing learning outcomes for all students. Let's incorporate this amendment into the motion and continue to move forward with a collaborative and data-driven approach."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I think Ellen's idea is excellent. Let's proceed to finalize the revised motion. If I understand correctly, the updated motion would involve approving $250,000 from the federal ESSER funds for devices, operational costs, and setup of a task force responsible for creating and monitoring the metrics that guarantee an equity-focused approach and measurable impact. With such a well-thought-out plan, we stand to benefit significantly by improving equity and better preparing students for their future endeavors. Does anyone have any final comments or suggested changes prior to a vote on this revised motion?"
