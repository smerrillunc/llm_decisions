    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.3: Technology Plan - The board will review a proposal to expand digital learning access by providing Chromebooks to every high school student. This initiative is estimated to cost $10,000 annually for devices, maintenance, and licensing. The program is designed to ensure equitable access to technology, support blended learning, and prepare students with digital skills for college and career readiness.. Who would like to start?"

    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "I think that there are multiple things going right here.  One thing that excites me about all these initiatives we're discussing today as part of our tech plan is that they truly align to the strategic goals around equity and how we provide access to tools to help students succeed at all levels. So with respect to Chromebook distribution, what's being proposed here represents an important step forward in addressing some gaps between groups within our high schools in terms of technology access. There may be questions about cost down the road, but overall it seems like something that could really pay dividends academically and long term for kids if implemented correctly. What do others think?\n``` -\u2010 davidoberg: It's definitely true that the equity issue here jumps out quickly as you look through demographic analysis. It does appear that different parts of the district have had better luck with parent funded efforts while other ones are having more trouble doing so. And then this was also addressed by Dr. Osborne during her superintendent's report recently. So first off before turning it over to the two presenters we've got lined up I just want to remind everybody of the last question from Judy Le because she asked whether we'd looked into partnerships and grants in order to defray costs and make sure it's sustainable longer term? Is that anything that has been pursued so far? Or if not should we give consideration to looking further into such opportunities? Dr. Callison-Katkia please go ahead. So one key piece which ties back to Judy Le's question is that we did discuss pursuing possible partnership options that might benefit us financially over time. A second major area involves working with the current partners where the money comes from and who helps us manage everything since it sounds like we still don't know yet exactly how the Chromebook initiative rollout looks based on what the funding situation turns out to be this year. How can we get ready early enough so that people have time to purchase and receive their computers before classes resume in late August?\n```"

  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Sure David, yes those were actually the two topics that Kate and Graham prepared for tonight. In regards to your initial inquiry, we didn't look specifically into any grant possibilities as part of this budget planning cycle but I agree completely with both Jon and Judy, that's certainly something worth considering for future years as well as additional ways to reduce financial burdens and increase sustainability. Next, regarding implementation logistics, that indeed remains unclear pending final budget decisions in June; but I'll let them talk more to both points in greater detail, including any potential partnerships that might assist us with reaching full coverage even faster. Kate and then Graham.\n```\nkateacuff: We expect there's an element of flexibility built into the request we presented for this coming fiscal year because we recognize there won't be complete clarity until after state revenues are released in May. That said, we made estimates assuming it wouldn't be very different from the past few years. If that doesn't happen then we can revise certain areas depending upon when budget figures come out. As it stands now, our timeline calls for issuing devices in mid-July, after staff training for summer instruction and professional development, because we realize that that allows educators adequate opportunity to familiarize themselves with new technologies prior to handing them over to kids just a month later.\n```"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thank you, Kate. Just to clarify, so we're anticipating device distribution in mid-July, giving teachers sufficient preparation time before distributing to students. Have we considered offering optional summer programs or workshops for students, particularly those most affected by the digital divide, to introduce them to these devices and basic digital literacy skills before the academic year begins?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Yes, David, that's absolutely something we envision happening. We believe it's crucial for students to gain familiarity with the devices and develop essential digital skills before the school year commences. Our intention is to collaborate with local libraries, non-profit organizations, and possibly partner schools to offer optional summer sessions or camps targeted towards under-resourced communities. These opportunities would equip students with fundamental knowledge and confidence in utilizing digital tools effectively, ultimately bridging the gap in technological proficiency. By incorporating outreach efforts and engaging diverse stakeholders, we hope to create an inclusive environment fostering seamless transitions into the upcoming school year."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Excellent approach, Kate. Your emphasis on partnering with local organizations to reach underserved populations resonates deeply. Additionally, providing resources beyond mere device distribution underscores our commitment to supporting student success. Would it be feasible to track participant demographics and assess the effectiveness of these summer initiatives, ensuring we target areas of greatest need and continually refine our strategies moving forward?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Absolutely, David. Accountability and data-informed decision-making are vital components of our strategy. We intend to collect participation data, survey feedback, and evaluate outcomes to gauge the efficacy of these summer initiatives. By monitoring demographics, engagement rates, and skill acquisition, we can identify trends, pinpoint areas requiring adjustments, and adapt our methods to maximize impact. Moreover, collaborating with local entities will facilitate resource sharing, amplify our collective reach, and yield valuable insights from their expertise serving similar demographics. This multi-faceted evaluation framework ensures continuous refinement and enables informed refinements to address evolving needs within our diverse student body."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Well said, Kate. Data-driven assessment will undoubtedly guide our progress toward equitable tech adoption. Speaking of which, Graham, could you elaborate on the projected annual costs associated with maintaining and replacing devices, software licenses, and infrastructure, as outlined in your presentation? Specifically, how do these expenses factor into our long-term planning and potential grant explorations?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Thanks Dave. On page five of my handout, I provided details about the projected costs of hardware replacement, operating system licensing, internet services and online content. Those expenditures break down to $145 per year for each high schooler served by the program. In addition,  $25 is needed annually for digital tool subscriptions and maintenance. Finally, network infrastructure upgrades cost approximately $200 thousand dollars. To ensure this initiative remains sustainable long-term, it may be beneficial to consider exploring alternative sources of revenue, potentially via grants and partnerships, along with investigating innovative means to repurpose existing funds dedicated to technology and infrastructure support. The idea being, at some point, the school division gets out of the business of buying laptops and more into leasing them with renewal guarantees. And then finally, obviously as they get older, those renewals become cheaper too. So hopefully by the end of seven years we've sort of reached equilibrium, maybe around $250 to $300 per kid overall. But if they start using things differently, say there are only half as many users needing devices by year six, then that amount could drop further.\n```"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "I appreciate the thorough breakdown, Graham. It's crucial we weigh the financial implications of this initiative while keeping equity and inclusivity at the forefront. Considering alternative revenue streams, such as grants, and creative financing options like leasing arrangements can help mitigate costs and ensure long-term viability. However, we must also prioritize allocating necessary resources for ongoing teacher training and support, as they play a pivotal role in maximizing the benefits of these digital tools for all students."
