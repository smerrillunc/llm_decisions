    "comment": "With this motion made by Dr. Johnson and seconded by Ms. O'Herron, and after hearing the other opinions from the Board Members,  Motion carried with five yeses and two abstentions.  The next item for consideration is Item #1, which would grant approval for an extension of our current Memorandum of Understanding with our local health department through December 31st of 2024. Is there a motion? Do we have a seconder? We do not have a motion yet. Does anyone wish to make a motion? I'll move it if nobody else wants to. I move. Second. You moved it; I second it. Any discussion? Anything? If so, any questions of Ms. Johnston? Okay. So I call roll. Ms. Colonna? No. Dr. Johnson? Yes. Mr. O'Herron? Abstain. Mr. Page? Yes. Ms. Acuff? Yes. Ms. Osborne? Yes. Ms. Le? Yes. Mr. Johnston? Abstain.  The motion passes. Is that correct? Yes, sir. That motion passed with six yesses and two abstentions. And then the final action item is something submitted late for the agenda and received by all board members today and dealt with the employment status of several employees. This was provided electronically today to each of the board members via email. It contains lists of those who were employed, dismissed, or reassigned within our system since the last meeting. Moved by Ms. Le. A second? Seconded by Ms. Acuff. I've reviewed the material online. There were seven resignations and three new hires in that category, five transfers, 12 people hired. And that ends that particular part of the list. Is there anything else about that, Ms. Johnston? Then I'll ask for any further comments from board members regarding the motions. Is there any comment at all? All right, I now request a recorded roll-call vote starting at the left with Ms. O'Herron and going across the dais down through myself at the far end of the table, beginning with Ms. Colonna. Ms. O'Herron? Yes. Dr. Johnson? Yes. Mr. O'Herron? Yes. Mr. Page? Yes. Ms. Acuff? Yes. Ms. Osborne? Yes. Ms. Le? Yes. Mr. Johnston? Yes. \nAfter reviewing the discussion, I"
