    "comment": "And after considering all comments from this meeting tonight, I am voting yes because we've had several discussions about these policies over time now with multiple readings,\nand so far there has not been any opposition expressed by anyone at those meetings either verbally\nor through written communication. So based upon what was said earlier today during public comment period when Mr. Page asked if anybody else wanted to speak against the motion but nobody did then spoke up which means they were given an opportunity to do something different than just sitting silently like everyone else who didn't say anything out loud nor write us letters expressing their concerns even though many people attended both sessions where the proposal got read aloud twice already without hearing objections raised anywhere along the way until he made his statement near end asking whether others would want him speaking instead since none came forward doing differently while staying silent otherwise throughout two full opportunities being presented them previously thus leading me into concluding majority consensus exists supporting passage hereof;\nvote yes."
