    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.3: Technology Plan - The board will review a proposal to expand digital learning access by providing Chromebooks to every high school student. This initiative is estimated to cost $10,000 annually for devices, maintenance, and licensing. The program is designed to ensure equitable access to technology, support blended learning, and prepare students with digital skills for college and career readiness.. Who would like to start?"

    "content": "Thank you, Graham Paige. I'd be happy to initiate our conversation about the proposed Chromebook plan. With equity at its core, it seeks to address existing disparities within our high schools. In that vein, I believe we must scrutinize whether each grade level receives equal funding, considering that middle and elementary students could benefit from similar opportunities. Kate Acuff, do your projections consider expanding these resources beyond ninth through twelfth graders?  And if so, how might we make sure lower-income students still have equal access outside of the classroom? We've heard anecdotal evidence suggesting limited internet connectivity can exist even among older siblings attending higher grades. What are the plans to address those concerns and potential limitations of online engagement?"

    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "So I'm wondering about those costs as well Jonno Alcaro. So when they say annualized over five years, does that mean $50,000 dollars total or would there continue to be an annual expense after year one or two? Could someone clarify what happens in year six? Also I think my experience has been consistent across Albemarle County where people with more means purchase their own laptops for their children. It seems some families who have greater income may get to avoid paying for a device fee whereas others without such financial capacity won't have that luxury. Has anyone looked into the possibility of charging device fees to all users of the provided laptop, regardless of socio-economic status? If not, isn't that counterproductive to reducing inequity because better-off families don't pay any additional amount while financially challenged families bear that burden?\n```9899bdfde43e5d8a13f7f6d2b19b0f48a8c51```\njonnoalcaro: So let me give you two responses. One is with regards to the first question that Kate brought up about device access in K through eight. And then I'll follow up with Kate's response regarding future planning for all levels. But no doubt that was mentioned previously in this room several times before during other discussions. However, Ms. Acuff did mention briefly looking ahead and exploring options at K through 12th-grade spans though she wasn't certain they had reached anything definitive. My interpretation of her sentiment aligns with what Dr. Osborne said earlier which emphasizes creating long-term solutions to provide equity. As far as the second part goes, I think Ms. Acuff is correct here in saying that both Kate and David O'Berg and others are working towards finding something workable for pre-K through twelve eventually but as yet haven't hit upon something truly viable. We also need to remember that we already offer free and reduced lunch rate computer use at $25 per annum. While Mr. Page referred to device cost burdens falling squarely onto low-income families, another concern raised pertains to Wi-Fi availability outside the classrooms. Some individuals expressed anxiety that even having a personal laptop could only serve as a symbolic achievement since real-life situations frequently restrict accessibility due to poor connectivity speeds or lack thereof altogether, which is often exacerbated in rural areas. That being the case, wouldn't implementing measures such as hotspot provision possibly help alleviate the issue somewhat? Thereby ensuring at least partial assistance exists in"

    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thank you, Johnno. Kate, I understand your questions about the projected costs and the device fees. I agree that transparency is crucial in understanding the budget implications. Perhaps we could request a detailed breakdown of the annual expenses to ensure we're making informed decisions. Regarding the device fees, I see your point about potentially exacerbating inequities. A possible solution could be to implement a sliding scale fee structure based on family income, allowing us to mitigate the burden on low-income households while maintaining fairness. Additionally, exploring partnerships with local organizations or businesses to provide subsidized hotspots or low-cost internet plans could further bridge the gap. By doing so, we can foster a more inclusive environment for all students. Ellen, would you like to share your thoughts on addressing these concerns and promoting equity throughout our district?"

  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, David. I appreciate the thoughtful questions and suggestions thus far. To address Kate's concern about the annual costs, I recommend we request a multi-year budget projection to ensure clarity on the financial commitment. Moreover, I concur with David's suggestion of exploring a sliding scale fee structure to minimize the impact on low-income families. Furthermore, I propose we investigate alternative financing models, such as grants or corporate sponsorships, to supplement the costs and create a sustainable program. By doing so, we can promote equity and ensure that all students have access to the necessary tools for success."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Building upon Ellen's suggestion, I think it's essential to explore multiple revenue streams, including state and federal funds, to offset the costs associated with providing Chromebooks and maintaining digital infrastructure. This will enable us to develop a comprehensive plan that addresses the needs of all students, particularly those in underserved communities.

    "content": "Yes, exactly, Ellen and Judy. Exploring diverse revenue sources, including grants, corporate sponsorships, and state/federal funding, will definitely help reduce our reliance on local funding alone and enhance sustainability. In addition, fostering strong relationships with local business leaders and educational partners allows us to stay current with industry trends, receive feedback on workforce preparedness, and incorporate relevant skill sets within our curricula. I'd also suggest we conduct focus groups with teachers, parents, and students from various socioeconomic backgrounds to gain insights into how technology integration might best support teaching practices and student outcomes. This way, we're taking a targeted approach to improve academic performance while accounting for differing learning styles and resource accessibility. With thorough analysis and collaboration, I believe we can make significant strides toward closing our digital divide and setting our students up for lifelong success."

  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Absolutely, Kate! The focus group idea is excellent. It's crucial that we involve stakeholders from diverse backgrounds to ensure our solution is tailored to meet the unique needs of our community. By incorporating their voices, we can identify potential barriers to implementation and develop strategies to overcome them. Additionally, I recommend we establish a dedicated task force to oversee the rollout of this initiative, comprising representatives from each stakeholder group, to monitor progress, address concerns, and make data-driven adjustments as needed. Transparency and ongoing evaluation will be key to achieving our goals."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Exactly right, Ellen. Establishing an inclusive task force ensures accountability, fosters communication among stakeholders, and enables adaptability throughout the process. Regularly assessing the effectiveness of our strategy helps refine our approaches over time, ultimately driving better results for our students. And I fully agree, involving diverse perspectives guarantees our efforts benefit all learners, regardless of socio-economic background, ability, or zip code."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Well said, Kate. By prioritizing inclusivity and continuous improvement, we can create a truly equitable system that supports every student's success. I'd like to take it a step further by suggesting we set specific, measurable goals and benchmarks to track our progress toward closing the digital divide. This will enable us to celebrate our successes and identify areas for growth, ensuring our initiative remains focused and effective. What do you think, team? Should we outline some initial targets and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to guide our efforts?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "I think establishing clear objectives and KPIs is vital, Ellen. They'll serve as a roadmap for our initiatives, empowering us to track our advancement toward equity in technology access and its influence on student achievement. For instance, we may measure the percentage of participating students demonstrating improved digital literacy, or examine increases in online engagement from underrepresented demographics. These metrics will not only inform strategic refinements but also offer valuable insight into what works well and where improvements should be made. Shall we begin outlining these targets now?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Excellent proposal, Jonno. By defining concrete objectives and KPIs, we'll create a shared understanding of what success looks like and ensure everyone's working towards the same goals. I recommend we categorize our objectives into three main areas: 1) Access and Equity, 2) Digital Literacy and Skills, and 3) Academic Achievement and Outcomes. Within each category, let's specify 2-3 key indicators to track progress. Who's ready to start brainstorming some potential objectives and KPIs?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Great framework, Ellen. In terms of the first area, \"Access and Equity,\" I propose one objective could be \"to increase the number of devices available per capita across schools.\" Our KPIs would then include tracking device-to-student ratios and the percentage of students who have access to at-home internet connectivity. Next week, perhaps we could review district reports to determine which schools need more devices and allocate resources accordingly. Does anyone else want to add any additional ideas for that area before moving forward?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Katrinas' suggestions for \"Access and Equity\" are excellent. To complement her proposals, I recommend considering another objective: \"To reduce the disparity in device quality and functionality across schools.\" A corresponding KPI could be the percentage of devices meeting minimum technical specifications, such as processor speed and storage capacity. By focusing on both quantity and quality, we can ensure equal opportunity for all students to engage effectively with digital resources."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Excellent expansion of our scope, Judy. Your suggestion acknowledges that simply providing devices isn't enough; they must also be suitable for modern learning tasks. I'm curious if others would prefer we standardize around a single type of device or instead work with multiple vendors to accommodate varying budgets and preferences across schools. Perhaps we could even explore partnerships with tech companies offering refurbished devices, reducing costs without sacrificing functionality. Thoughts?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I appreciate your thoughtful suggestions, Katrina and Judy. We indeed need to consider both availability and quality when addressing device disparities. While standardization offers benefits like simplified maintenance and teacher training, flexibility in vendor choices might allow us to secure better deals and cater to different user needs. Partnering with organizations refurbishing devices sounds promising too \u2013 we can explore those opportunities further. Now, shall we move on to the second category, 'Digital Literacy and Skills'? How about we aim to boost proficiency levels through staff development programs, targeting teachers' comfort and expertise with EdTech tools?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Wonderful discussion, everyone! I love seeing the depth of thought and consideration going into our objectives and KPIs. Let's summarize the \"Access and Equity\" category before moving on: we've got two objectives \u2013 increasing devices per capita and reducing device quality disparities \u2013 with corresponding KPIs tracking device-to-student ratios, at-home internet access, and device specs. I agree with Kate that we should weigh the pros and cons of standardization versus flexible vendor options, and exploring refurbished devices is definitely worth investigating. Moving on to \"Digital Literacy and Skills,\" Kate's suggestion to target teacher training and EdTech proficiency is spot on. Another possible objective could be \"to implement a comprehensive digital citizenship curriculum\" to empower students with responsible tech use skills. What other ideas do you have for this category?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Ellen, I completely support the addition of digital citizenship education, especially given the increasingly complex online environment our students navigate daily. Another idea for \"Digital Literacy and Skills\" could be \"to develop and promote online resource repositories\" that curate high-quality, accessible materials aligned with our curriculum standards. By doing so, we facilitate equitable access to educational content while fostering critical thinking and information literacy. Additionally, we might consider an objective focused on upskilling our media specialists and librarians, enabling them to provide targeted support for educators integrating technology effectively into their teaching practices."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Excellent suggestions, Kate! The digital citizenship curriculum will help students develop essential skills for navigating online spaces responsibly. And I love the idea of creating online resource repositories to ensure equitable access to high-quality educational content. That ties nicely with our goal of supporting blended and digital learning models. Upskilling our media specialists and librarians is crucial too, as they play a vital role in bridging the gap between technology and pedagogy. Let's add those to our list. Moving on to the third category, \"Academic Achievement and Outcomes,\" what objectives and KPIs do you think we should focus on?

  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "I concur that examining the correlation between technology access and academic achievement holds great value. One objective could be \"to monitor the relationship between device usage and student performance in core subjects.\" A related KPI would involve analyzing student grades and standardized test scores alongside measures of device adoption and frequency of digital tool utilization. Furthermore, it'd be interesting to investigate whether technology integration influences dropout rates, attendance, or discipline incidents, allowing us to identify trends warranting attention. This multi-faceted approach provides a clearer picture of how technology contributes to holistic student growth. Other thoughts on \"Academic Achievement and Outcomes\"?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Jonno, I appreciate your emphasis on data-driven decision-making by linking device usage to student performance metrics. To expand upon that, maybe we could also set an objective to \"enhance personalized learning experiences through adaptive technology and analytics.\" This could involve piloting AI-powered instructional systems that tailor instruction to individual learners based on real-time assessment results, helping teachers pinpoint areas where students require extra support. If successful, we may observe improvements not only in academic performance but also student engagement and motivation. Has anybody considered partnering with local institutions of higher ed to leverage research and best practices in this realm?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Katrina's proposal for adaptive technology and analytics resonates deeply with me. It echoes my own concerns about ensuring equity extends beyond mere device distribution to actual learning outcomes. By incorporating AI-driven solutions, we can potentially address long-standing achievement gaps and create a more responsive, student-centered system. Collaborating with nearby universities or research centers would indeed bring valuable expertise to the table, facilitating knowledge sharing and innovation. In terms of KPIs for this objective, we might track changes in student progress toward meeting state standards, decreases in course failures, or increases in student self-efficacy."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thanks, Judy. Your support highlights the potential transformative power of adapting technology to meet diverse learner needs. For these indicators, we should establish baselines now, prior to implementing any new initiatives, to accurately gauge future gains. Moreover, it would be enlightening to compare student outcomes among cohorts receiving traditional instruction vs. those using AI-assisted approaches. Lastly, Kate had mentioned teacher training earlier. With our growing investment in EdTech infrastructure, are there any plans or recommendations for professional development opportunities tailored specifically to effective technology integration within classrooms? Shouldn't that figure prominently in our strategy to maximize returns from investments?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Absolutely, Katr\u012bna. Teacher preparation and ongoing support are paramount for harnessing the full benefits of technology-enhanced instruction. In line with our goals, let's prioritize establishing \"teacher technology competency benchmarks and training pathways.\" These could encompass workshops, coaching, and peer mentorship programs centered around innovative uses of technology, lesson design, and classroom management strategies. We'll need clear guidelines outlining expected proficiencies and staged implementation timelines. Such structured support ensures all educators feel empowered to optimize EdTech resources for improved student outcomes. How about we schedule dedicated time during upcoming faculty meetings and summer institutes for introductory sessions on technology integration and planning for subsequent training phases?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Agreed, Kate. Well-planned staff development lays the groundwork for sustained success. Aligning our PD efforts with our district's strategic plan reinforces its importance. Scheduling initial sessions early next year sets the stage for phased rollouts of training modules. David, considering budget constraints, could you estimate costs associated with hiring trainers, developing customized curricula, and covering substitute teacher expenses when needed? Having rough estimates allows us to factor these expenditures into our FY23 budget request."
