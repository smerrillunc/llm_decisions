    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Good afternoon, Graham. I'd be happy to kick off the discussion today. Our goal here at the district has been to provide each student with their own device since we started our one-to-one pilot three years ago. It was clear that there were significant equity issues between schools, as well as between individual families' ability to purchase and maintain devices. In order to take advantage of more personalized instruction and collaboration tools and opportunities that are available online, it became apparent that all of our students need to have these devices. With all of the work being done around curriculum alignment and professional development and social-emotional learning, we've created an environment where technology can enhance both teaching and learning. We think that this plan should really help us meet some goals related to college and career readiness and closing opportunity gaps, so we recommend its approval. Kate Acuff had mentioned earlier she wanted to speak about this item also. Would you like her to go next or maybe David O'Berg could add something about budgeting implications before we open up for other questions and comments. Thank you very much."

    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thanks Jon. I'll let Kate go ahead first. She did mention that she wished to say something regarding the proposed action on providing chrome books for all high schoolers. After that, we can get back to Mr. O'Berg if he wishes to make any commentaries. Please go right ahead, Ms. Acuff. If someone else has anything they wish to say, please just give me a quick signal when Kate finishes speaking. Go ahead Kate.   There's no rush; there is ample time within which to consider your thoughts. So don't hesitate because time might become tight. That's not going to happen tonight. As we do this, what I want people who respond after Kate is finished is try to stay away from repetition because I know this room may generate repetitive ideas. When you're considering whether you would like to respond after someone speaks, see if the thought you're having was already stated in another form. Remember your time isn't unlimited but that does mean you must speed through everything either. Stay relaxed during your speeches and remember we appreciate your opinions whether you completely agree with them or not. Thank you. Go right ahead Kate. I am ready whenever you are. Just wait until I nod okay? One last thing I forgot is it looks like we now have four members present so you cannot act without my input even though we only have five total due to Ellen Osborne's absence. Therefore, the way things look now we are quorate. Yes, thank you, go ahead. You might say there were only two speakers but when Kate was finished, 30 seconds passed while we looked at the rest of you guys waiting for some kind of acknowledgement that someone intended to speak. Don't feel hesitant. Don you ever feel afraid because you worry someone in authority won't like how you sound. What counts most isn't your sentence structure per se. Your ideas count for everything. Okay, please proceed. And then Dave said yes. That means the chair acknowledges him as well. Alright Dave. Do go ahead. Thank you very much. Here we go again. Remember, everybody doesn't always follow the same line of thinking. Your ideas have value too. Thanks Dave for making sure you got acknowledged. Finally you could tell me what it was you hoped to discuss.  Kate, go ahead. Then David. Now is your chance.\nkateacuff: I simply want to acknowledge the recommendation for the purchase of Chromebooks for all of our students attending Albemarle"

    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thank you, Kate. To echo Kate's sentiments, I believe investing in Chromebooks for all high school students aligns with our district's commitment to equity, supporting digital literacy, and enhancing overall educational experiences. While the annual costs may seem substantial, I'm interested in exploring ways to potentially offset expenses through grant funding, public-private partnerships, or strategic budget realignments. Before opening the floor to further discussion, I'd like to ask Jon or our administrative team if they've explored such alternatives thus far?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Thank you Kate, Dave.  Yes, actually we have researched possible alternative revenue streams. In fact, over the past year, I worked closely with division administration and local government partners to identify potential grants and private funding sources. Although securing additional monies takes time, and results aren't guaranteed, this endeavor remains ongoing. Additionally, we are constantly reviewing current budgets seeking ways to optimize allocations to minimize added expenditures. These considerations combined with future assessments of actual costs incurred following implementation will ultimately inform subsequent decisions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thank you, Jon, for addressing Dave's question. I'd like to build upon the theme of equity and ensuring all students have equal access to technology. Could we explore the possibility of implementing a sliding scale fee or financial assistance program for families struggling to cover the annual device insurance premium? This would guarantee that socio-economically disadvantaged students are not disproportionately burdened by the new policy. By doing so, we can promote true inclusivity and avoid exacerbating existing inequities."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Judy, thanks for bringing that forward. I truly share those concerns. Our team has considered cost-sharing models, including tiered payment structures or subsidies for low-income households. We envision a flexible system that balances affordability with sustainability. We are planning on researching peer districts for best practices, conducting focus groups involving families across diverse economic backgrounds, and consulting with local organizations familiar with area demographics to better understand our community needs prior to finalizing our approach."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thank you, Jon, for sharing those thoughtful plans to ensure equitable access.

Perhaps we could establish clear criteria for determining eligibility for subsidized rates or explore collaboration with local non-profits offering technology-related services to our lower-income families. How feasible would it be to integrate these measures into our rollout timeline, and what types of data points would guide our decision-making process moving forward?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Absolutely, Kate, and I concur wholeheartedly about prioritization. With respect to feasibility, our intention is to phase in financial aid components simultaneously with Chromebook distribution. To determine subsidy eligibility, we plan on utilizing existing metrics like FRL and FAFSA status. Further research on non-profit collaborations will likely yield more options. Key indicators guiding us include demographic analysis of participating families, household income distribution, and post-implementation feedback from stakeholders throughout the county. Our team stands committed to regularly assessing impact and adjusting accordingly."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",

    "content": "You hit another nail right on the head, Kate. Parental involvement holds immense significance here, since they play such influential roles modeling and reinforcing healthy digital habits alongside their children. We've thoughtfully arranged family workshops, info nights, and individualized consultations with school counselors to offer guidance, tools, and open communication channels for caregivers. Additionally, district-wide emails with links to helpful articles, webinars, and curated lists of recommended educational apps will provide accessible support networks while encouraging shared conversations between parents and kids. Parents, after all, deserve equal access to the knowledge and resources necessary for nurturing well-adjusted digital natives."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Your multifaceted approach to engaging parents resonates deeply with me, Jon. By providing various touchpoints and formats, we can cater to different learning styles and preferences, ultimately increasing the likelihood of meaningful connections. Offering workshops, consultation sessions, and curated resources demonstrates our dedication to equipping caregivers with the expertise needed to navigate complex issues surrounding digital citizenship. Would it be possible to develop some formative assessments to gauge the effectiveness of these outreach efforts over time, ensuring that our messaging resonates with families and informing potential refinements to our strategy?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Formative assessment will serve as crucial benchmarks in gauging parent engagement quality and determining areas ripe for refinement.
