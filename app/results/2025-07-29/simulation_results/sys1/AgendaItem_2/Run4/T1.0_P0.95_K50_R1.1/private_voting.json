    "content": "One area that came up for me, during pandemic schooling was, of course, lack of availability, right, and trying to find out who did not have computers at home, but the other thing that happened is we realized, well, let's say you have a computer at home but if you don't have internet connection it doesn't help that much, so the whole connectivity piece is crucial here. How are we going to address these issues about ensuring that they're not just devices per se, because otherwise,  devices alone might still mean no connection and they need that too to do homework, complete assignments online and learn effectively. In terms of partnerships, there's already been an AT&T grant available. There were hotspots made available to families last year which actually really helped alleviate the problem quite a bit for many families. Now you mentioned how else could you potentially secure funding. Well the E-rate system should cover some costs like the network infrastructure upgrades, so we'll be able to take advantage of federal e-rate dollars to offset some maintenance costs. We've had quite good fortune with corporate partners helping us address those issues so certainly something we can look into in terms of the infrastructure of maintaining them in the long run. That said though the current pandemic funds might allow us flexibility. As we think about all these, you know there's the one-time payment and then there's the annual recurrent ones, how can we best use the available funding without burdening our local budget or relying on just grants, given that those sometimes come and go. Another potential area for thought could lie in how local government entities partner together. For instance, they could contribute to setting up network connectivity infrastructure so students can access reliable internet services when at home. How could we make those devices accessible and useful even outside of school, not only just by setting up the infrastructure but even beyond that? So that is another important part of the equation, and that has to be worked into our project goals since the device itself wouldn't magically solve these differences in connectivity by themselves."
