    "comment": "Motion carries with four yeses and one abstention. Thanks, everybody. Our next action item concerns  the approval of this year's summer school program. The administration recommends adopting the proposed plan, which includes sessions running from June 13th through July 15th. We've had a lot of public comment about the importance of offering more learning opportunities over the summer break. Dr. Farmer? Are there any changes to the proposal since we last discussed it at our work session? Or would you like me just to open the floor for questions? And then go ahead and call roll when we're ready to take action? If they could tell us what else if anything else needs to be added, that would be fine."
