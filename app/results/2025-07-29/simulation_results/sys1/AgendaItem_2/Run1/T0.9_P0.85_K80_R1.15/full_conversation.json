    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.3: Technology Plan - The board will review a proposal to expand digital learning access by providing Chromebooks to every high school student. This initiative is estimated to cost $10,000 annually for devices, maintenance, and licensing. The program is designed to ensure equitable access to technology, support blended learning, and prepare students with digital skills for college and career readiness.. Who would like to start?"

And then I'd also appreciate your thoughts on if there are additional costs beyond what we're looking at now that might be needed further down the line as part of this plan. Thank you."

    "content": "Yes, Jon, thank you for asking about our current status regarding digital equity across our district. Currently, while many of our middle schools have one-to-one device programs in place, access becomes more varied once students reach high school. We still see disparities in take-home technology availability, particularly within low-income households. In fact, our recent survey revealed around 25% of families reported no reliable internet connection at home. As for future costs, aside from the annual fee mentioned earlier, it's crucial we consider the need for ongoing infrastructure upgrades, network enhancements, and eventually replacing these devices after their lifespan. By committing to an analysis of our overall technology infrastructure, we can better anticipate and budget for these expenditures ahead. That being said, I believe the benefits of ensuring all high schoolers have equal opportunities for success far outweigh these potential added expenses. Does anyone else want to weigh in on this aspect before moving forward?"

    "content": "Yes, I'll add some perspective. Given our goal of preparing all students for post-secondary options, including higher education and entering the workforce, digital literacy has become a critical skill set. As Dr. Acuff pointed out, despite our efforts thus far, inequities persist across different demographic groups within the student body. By investing in a comprehensive plan such as this, I think we demonstrate a genuine commitment not only to bridging that gap but promoting academic parity throughout our district's upper-level courses. My question for tonight is related to teacher training components embedded into the proposal and what kinds of technical assistance they may receive. It seems essential to me that our educators feel confident using the tools available, especially when tasked with developing lessons tailored to the digital classroom environment.\n```ssiwenstein:  To piggyback off Katrina's query, I do wonder whether our proposed professional development strategy will include collaboration sessions with teachers who've already gained experience teaching digitally-rich content so we learn best practices for maximizing tech-based instruction. If yes, does the staff know which specific resource allocations we expect those colleagues to help us identify during planning for next year. Is it something we'll hear later? Will other department heads share resources in ways that enhance student outcomes?\n```\nkateacuff: Our intention indeed involves enlisting instructor feedback via focus group settings and anonymous surveys about areas where they perceive themselves requiring guidance on integrating technology seamlessly into course work. I envision that, together with curriculum directors and IT experts, these collaborations should uncover practical methods both enhancing educator comfort levels and improving instructional design quality for the benefit of students. An overview outlining that component was included in the packet distributed at last night's committee meeting. You were right; however, not everyone received packets, so it will be uploaded to Board Docs soon for general reference. I promise, in a future session, we can discuss further details about allocating resources across departments. Right now, let's prioritize weighing in on just the concept itself of supporting all high school kids through providing Chromebooks. Are there opinions pro/con we haven't heard yet that folks wish to voice? We mustn't miss hearing varying perspectives to inform a well-rounded decision that works optimally for each stakeholder involved here today. Does anybody want to make a statement or request further clarification prior to voting on tonight's resolution proposing full-time deployment of student computing capabilities systemwide? Or shall I ask for that formal motion in favor of going forward? What do you all think?\n```"
