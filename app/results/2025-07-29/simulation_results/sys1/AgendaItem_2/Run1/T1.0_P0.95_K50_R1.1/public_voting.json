Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.3: Technology Plan - The board will review a proposal to expand digital learning access by providing Chromebooks to every high school student. This initiative is estimated to cost $10,000 annually for devices, maintenance, and licensing. The program is designed to ensure equitable access to technology, support blended learning, and prepare students with digital skills for college and career readiness.. Who would like to start?"

    "content": "I want to emphasize that if we continue to not provide equal access across our student body at the high schools we've been going about it long enough now where you'd think all kids have laptops. And because they don't have one, you assume their parents are able to afford them. But that isn't true. In the time I've spent talking with teachers there were classes last week where we had students who did not have a device. They're going to fall behind as long as those other kids are having some sort of support from home. So I do think these devices really need to be available. And I'm in favor of doing something now rather than later as long as the money can be found within the existing budget. Does anybody know how much of an effect the new funding could help with that particular figure that I saw listed on here of $10,000?\n``` limburggayle: Is Jon Alcaro still speaking right? If Jon, just give him his first name. And we won't say Dr. Alcaro just put (clears throat) Jon Alcaro. I thought maybe Jon Alcaro had two thoughts so I didn't cut him off quickly but then after a minute I started wondering whether he was finished or I should let someone else talk at this moment? There was quite a bit of discussion last meeting. There was quite a bit of a difference in what that first speaker said, which had the cost being split between general purpose classroom teachers and pupil personnel. That changed into this business about $15 million. He said, 'There is probably still going to be 30 percent and we are assuming this is going to help us reach the low income levels and English learners. However, that amount was mentioned differently the last time as 30 percent of people of color. Then he gave the impression that the local contribution required, I mean they seem to prefer to see localities taking care of the bulk of it, that the state had no obligation there, because it must be done on an ongoing basis after year three, at least that is my reading of everything. It does not necessarily get you through three years but they may take note of it at any point in time. It says one time only, yet I believe it might be something more serious because it was referred to several times. Anyway, let's look for $25 per device over five years. I imagine the cost will rise above $10,000 per year. I'm asking around"

    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "And I wanted to follow up as well. So what kind of a guarantee is there that if we invest in these Chromebooks, they will stay active for five years without needing any additional fees or license increases beyond that initial fee? We understand this initial year's expenditure but can we have some clarification or assurance about the longevity of their usefulness, or is there a built-in obsolescence that forces another expense for replacing them in the middle of that term in order to maintain their use.  And also I wanted to clarify the logistics.  How does it work exactly for students to receive those in the classrooms or when they leave and who takes care of those throughout their four years while they\u2019re there if you go ahead with that?  And finally what's the strategy we have in place once the student goes away to college where you handed out a laptop for $400. What happens to the Chromebook then?\n```\n Unknown:    So the plan right now in  is  for  a $40 device administration and support license fee along with  a  protection against theft or loss accidental  damages extended warranty of $20.  It provides the coverage, so I am sure the Chromebook itself has a three-year  hardware warranty.  And then at the end of year three, we expect a full replacement of that Chromebook,  then we pay the $25 per student which brings in the next Chromebook.  In reality, there are two costs involved with every Chromebook.  It\u2019s the initial acquisition price of $330 which you see written down in your handout.  And the license fee or support license fee for security management and theft protection that is the second component.  If you ask me, since the county is responsible for buying for the students enrolled, why doesn\u2019t the locality just purchase outright as long as they pay that extra fee,   then you would need to worry less about license fee increases,   you would own them outright, just add the annual administrative support license and security coverage, because  if you keep extending the license past 2026 I just believe even though I don\u2019t see anything in the legislation that means we cannot choose on our own volition to buy new computers later I think what could happen to these students if the computer stops working before year three and they have a child getting ready to take his final exams at school who suddenly has no device for two weeks waiting for one. It seems as though that is definitely possible because it has happened"
