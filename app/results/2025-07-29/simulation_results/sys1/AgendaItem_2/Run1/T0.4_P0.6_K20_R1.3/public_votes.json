    "comment": "Okay. So after hearing all this input from everyone else - because we've had quite an extensive amount of time discussing these policies tonight with public comment period at both ends plus some additional comments by staff and so forth...I do appreciate how much work has gone into them over many months now really since last spring when they were first introduced. And there was certainly more than enough notice given about what would happen if someone didn't agree with something within those rules which could cause us not being able to adopt any part of Policy GBG until next year. But again like Dr. Haas said earlier though he did say also that even then nothing says we can't go back later but just based upon everything that happened here today including Mr. Page saying his motion failed due to lack of second during the afternoon session and yet still having another chance brought up through Mrs. Colonna Schmidt who made her own personal appeal directly addressing me asking why couldn't she get consideration too especially considering two other people already got theirs approved without needing seconds anyway. It seems pretty clear that while maybe most things might pass okay perhaps others may require further review down the road once adopted officially tomorrow night unless changed prior to adoption. In light of such concerns expressed throughout the meeting along with knowing each person gets their individual opportunity speaking out against anything whether voting yay nay or choosing to stay silent altogether regardless of whatever happens ultimately regarding approval disapproval or tabling items voted on separately per section rather than en masse together; therefore taking every single thing mentioned above fully into account coupled alongside seeing firsthand multiple times where certain individuals' voices weren't heard initially only getting acknowledged afterwards via motions put forward by different colleagues stepping up trying to help address issues raised personally affecting specific community stakeholders involved locally going beyond simply looking solely towards future potential legal implications nationally across America concerning matters unrelated specifically tied to Albemarle County Public Schools system itself.
