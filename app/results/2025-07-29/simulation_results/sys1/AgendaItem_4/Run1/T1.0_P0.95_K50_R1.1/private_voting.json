    "content": "I'll get us started, thank you. This has been in works since last year, and we've received positive input from both teachers and families. Kate Acuff and Katrina Callsen led a fantastic team during the pilot stage and presented data at our April 28 meeting. So why not take a moment to go over that report, then address any questions before proceeding further. We have an extra document that is shared as well where you all should be able to view the curriculum and additional information online so if there are items you need more detail, let me know. It may seem like extra work for some teachers in this transition process but it will provide students multiple pathways and greater opportunities. I think overall it has been clear that it has worked really well thus far in improving student outcomes. We can probably spend most of tonight going through that but do open it up to discussion right now too. Does anyone want to respond? Any questions? Do either one of those people who worked with Katrina and Kate have anything they want to add now?\nkateacuff: Kate Acuff here. I'm going to jump into it just for two things, please don't forget your materials. I added them by name. Number one, the way in which the new standard and curricula align is really important because they are built on evidence based research on teaching math specifically to kids during the mid-level years between sixth grade, seventh, and eighth. And so there's something called productive persistence where kids learn early how to persist and persevere in math even when problems become difficult in higher level years. That's something that is woven throughout every day with this instruction. There isn't a certain period dedicated to doing perseverance exercises. Rather we teach kids to tackle and attack problems. Then as problems build in difficulty later on, their skill set is such that they can continue to succeed even when faced with unknowns or uncharted territory. As Mr. Alcaro mentioned, David O'Berg also talked about the three-year pilot. In year one, it was pretty stark. We were really down compared to benchmarking district. At end of year two, we had improved significantly but did lose ground in a little bit. Year three though, the kids were essentially at parity with the benchmarking districts across the entire spectrum of different type of subgroups whether race, gender, or whatever subgroup we use when looking at school children's background information. Thank you again. The real key with perseverance and these math scores moving higher as"

What we wanted to emphasize was the increase on our growth composite for 2022. Across all three grades, the results showed significant growth, demonstrating the value in adopting this curriculum to drive improvements in math performance."

    "content": "Thank you, Jon. Before we dive deeper, I'd like to commend Kate and Katrina on their outstanding presentation and dedication to this pilot. Their efforts have yielded impressive growth, particularly among our historically underperforming student groups. I'd like to ask, what specific support structures are being considered to ensure our teachers receive the necessary training and resources to effectively implement this new curriculum, especially given the shift towards project-based learning and digital tools?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "\"Thank you, Dave, and Kate, and Katrina for the thorough update.  I appreciate your diligence in presenting evidence-based research supporting the new curriculum's design.  To Dave's point, I share concerns about ensuring teachers feel adequately prepared to implement these changes successfully. Have we considered offering ongoing coaching and mentoring, particularly for teachers who may struggle with integrating digital tools and project-based learning approaches?\""
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Exactly. That was discussed within the materials, but it deserves emphasis. Embedded throughout our proposal are plans for tiered professional development, acknowledging individual staff needs while addressing collective responsibilities. Alongside a summer workshop prior to implementation, teachers will participate in bi-monthly sessions focusing on instructional strategies, effective integration of digital tools, and fostering productive student collaboration. Additionally, building-based instructional coaches will be made available to teachers seeking targeted assistance and guidance on a regular basis. These sustained support systems aim to build teacher confidence while empowering them to adapt and grow alongside their students.  Ellen Osborne, please proceed with your thoughts."

    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, Kate. I appreciate the attention to teacher support and development in this proposal. Building on Judy's concern, I'd like to highlight the importance of equity in our approach to implementation. How will we ensure that all teachers, particularly those serving our most vulnerable student populations, receive the targeted support they need to successfully integrate these new strategies and resources? Can we discuss potential metrics or indicators to track the effectiveness of our professional development efforts and make adjustments as needed?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "That's a critical consideration, Ellen. Ensuring our teacher support structures intentionally prioritize equity will be vital for the success of this initiative. Kate and Katrina, would you mind speaking briefly to that? Then, we'll hear from Graham Page. I believe he has a follow-up question related to the data Kate referenced earlier. Katrina, maybe start us off."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I completely agree with you, Ellen. Our commitment to equity must be a cornerstone of our implementation plan. To address this directly, we propose a few essential components. First, we intend to establish equity-focused PLCs and collaborative leadership teams led by designated facilitators tasked with monitoring progress and suggesting targeted interventions. Second, we'll apply an equity lens to all coaching and mentoring programs, guaranteeing that teachers working with historically underserved student populations receive tailored assistance. Lastly, we suggest incorporating anonymous feedback mechanisms allowing teachers to express concerns, requests, or successes that can help guide future professional development decisions. This triangulation of structured support systems should enable all teachers to develop the skills and expertise required to excel with our new mathematics curriculum, ultimately fostering equitable student outcomes. Kate can expand upon the metrics aspect of your inquiry."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thank you, Katrina. I fully concur with Katrina's outline for equity-focused supports. Regarding metrics, we're committed to tracking both quantitative and qualitative measures to assess the efficacy of our professional development initiatives. Some key performance indicators include teacher self-efficacy surveys, student survey responses capturing perceived teacher support, and analysis of student growth composites disaggregated by demographic group. Additionally, we plan to conduct annual program evaluations, soliciting input from teachers, administrators, and focus groups. By leveraging this multi-faceted approach, we can pinpoint areas of strength and weakness, making informed refinements to our professional development offerings to maximize teacher readiness and foster academic excellence for every student. Graham Page, I believe you had a follow-up question on the data presented earlier?"

    "content": "I really want to say thank you to Ms. Acuff and Ms. Callson for giving you some sense of the work on this and just want to acknowledge how great it was to see even this evening Kate's passion around math education expressed. So often at meetings during the year I wish more people could come out and understand where we are right now, because a lot of people I've talked to don't realize that elementary schools teach math differently than middle school and high school levels do. I love what Dave mentioned and then also what Judy kind of shared is how important it is to recognize in order for this to take place it means teachers going through, not just learning new material, but changing the way they interact with students, so we absolutely will put forward that request from you.  I think last time and just before Mr. Alcaro left, someone asked if other systems went to something else or if they returned back.  My guess is if they didn't adopt these things there, one system at least locally adopted a new series a year ago and actually pulled back on it after one year. Now I'm not certain. I couldn't get any details on whether their middle school went ahead, but my assumption would be that our staff have looked at several possibilities and this was a major choice to look at, which I am very glad they chose for us. My final comment here, Ms. Acuff, as we try to learn and to explore better how to go forward with this, I'd very much like for you and staff just to come and visit board members occasionally and tell us what's going on. We know that there's a lot, no matter what it is, there'll always be positive and negative comments about change.  But to keep me informed, give me things like what you're giving right now where we find ourselves  in comparison and show us exactly how well the students are performing will mean a great deal, I believe, in keeping trust within the county because we'll be making some requests over the next couple years probably. And, in my case anyway, I could say there was no request I received concerning the old curriculum except one parent who happened to also serve on SAG. But if you remember early in the pandemic, I know we only met with just a handful of parents, all I got on zoom calls from a whole bunch of other people were about a return, which I couldn't fathom given what we're asking our staff to do"

    "content": "Yeah, that I do hope for this and, Judy, I hope what you heard said tonight really tells us that we're taking a course that will get to the end result of really helping each kid, based on that information you provided, Dr. Haas.  I want them to be able to measure us in three years that we could have brought up those people in our lower group up to the 90 percentiles, but yet still maintain or increase further our top level kids.  In short, my thing is when we look, particularly after being at Lee High School for an hour with teachers talking about their needs, knowing it wasn't going to meet needs of their lower-income students, you know what you have been told, they were already telling you a story. When all the people had gone home, the one person left that day to answer questions of my own was the teacher of the alternative ed in English and math at Lee. She didn't just care about her lowest income ones, she knew them all by name. She sat in my room saying she knows she had not been doing enough. I know nothing more to do with them, but I've just got to learn to try something new again. Well, if these tools are all that and a bag of chips for teaching, we won't need all this other, or maybe we would. But, in reality, if she says she wants to be taught better, she doesn't want it for herself;  It's for her students. What our challenge is, is what do our teachers require? What do they desire most, to be trained best with these tools on how to deliver them. If they ask for extra hours, we have to make sure we're trying to find those hours and ways to use the money that we have without breaking us. We need this for teachers all the way down to special ed because every single kid counts. If all of that takes place, I think that I know we can be very successful because it seems like everything has been thought through from looking at the 17 people who started it from looking at the number to see which textbook was the best choice overall and we did make a different choice from others.  And I think what they have brought forward is a package that they can succeed with in meeting our goal for the bottom of the students while increasing the top students' scores as well. So thank you for such a tremendous amount of work to make a difference and for me to"
