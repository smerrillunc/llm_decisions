    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.4: Student Code of Conduct - The board will review proposed updates to the district\u2019s Student Code of Conduct, which outlines behavioral expectations and disciplinary procedures. Key changes include new rules around cell phone usage during instructional time, updates to the dress code to reflect inclusivity and professionalism, and revisions to disciplinary consequences to promote restorative practices.. Who would like to start?"

    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I'd be happy to kick off this conversation. Thank you so much staff for bringing these important updates forward. As we all know our student conduct policy is one of those living documents it needs regular attention because times change circumstances shift and most importantly students evolve. So thank you again for your work here today. One thing jumped out at me right away was the addition of language related to inclusive attire. Can someone walk us through what exactly has changed there and how did we arrive at some of these specific guidelines? And also just curious if any feedback from teachers parents guardians have been incorporated into this process thus far. Thanks!"

  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Kate, thanks for starting the conversation. I completely agree with you about the importance of regularly reviewing our policies to ensure they remain relevant and effective.\n\nRegarding the updated dress code, I think it's fantastic that we're moving towards greater inclusivity and respect for individuality. From my understanding, the revised guidelines aim to eliminate gender-specific restrictions and focus more on ensuring clothing doesn't disrupt the learning environment. For instance, we've removed references to skirts being required for girls and instead emphasize modesty and appropriateness overall.\n\nAs for stakeholder input, yes, we did gather feedback from various groups, including teachers, administrators, parents, and even students themselves. We held several forums and surveys over the past semester to get their thoughts on areas needing improvement"

    "content": "Ellen, appreciate that clarification. It sounds like an effort well worth taking given where society stands now. What kind of response were you getting back from kids when discussing potential adjustments? Were there certain aspects they felt strongly needed changing versus others maybe less pressing? Did anything surprise them particularly within teacher parent guardian responses too?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Ah, great follow-up questions, Kate. When engaging with students, we found they overwhelmingly supported revising the dress code to allow for personal expression while maintaining a safe and respectful atmosphere. Many appreciated the move toward neutrality regarding gendered clothing items. Some specifically mentioned feeling uncomfortable with previous requirements forcing them into binary choices that didn't align with their identities.\n\nInterestingly, quite a few students emphasized wanting clearer definitions around \"distracting\" or \"inappropriate\" clothing \u2013 essentially seeking consistency across schools and among educators. They wanted assurance that enforcement wouldn't become overly subjective or biased.\n\nIn terms of surprises, both students and adults alike expressed concerns about the impact social media can have on self-perception and body image, especially concerning revealing or provocative outfits.

Or do either Dr. McLaughlin or Dr. Carlson want to make comments first? If no other person wants to comment, then perhaps Dr. Acuff could ask her second half of her original question."

    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Yes, David O'Berg brought up something interesting. To clarify further, disruptive cellphone use includes non-instructional periods, correct? That means hallways between classes, cafeteria, playgrounds, et cetera. Am I reading correctly?"

    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "You guys addressed two things already. But let me say quickly, Dave, I'm glad you pointed that out cause I saw that same sentence myself wondering whether it applied beyond classroom instruction period. Now onto my main point though. In looking at discipline actions taken by grade level, I noticed middle school seems disproportionately represented compared to high school. Is there insight why that might occur? Could we discuss possible reasons behind this trend?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Well, Katrina raises a valid concern. Perhaps Dr. McLauglhin would care to offer insights based upon his experience working closely alongside administration and faculty members throughout different levels. Maybe he knows factors contributing to higher disciplinary incidents reported during early adolescence rather than late teenage years. Would love hearing his perspective."

    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Thank you very much, Madam Chair. So just so everyone is clear here, if someone has been involved in bullying activities and gets caught doing those sorts of behaviors again, what happens then? Does one strike mean suspension automatically, or how will these infractions be handled going forward? And also, any chance of restorative justice practices making its way into some form of resolution process down the line? Thanks!"

    "speaker": "judyle",

  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Ah, yes, Kate, regarding your question about future focus groups around dress code changes... Absolutely, we plan to engage with students through surveys, town halls, and smaller group discussions to ensure their voices are heard while balancing concerns from parents and staff alike. Our goal remains creating an environment where every individual feels comfortable expressing themselves without compromising others' comfort zones. Rest assured, self-expression won't come at the cost of inappropriate content."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "One thing which came across loud and clear was frustration over inconsistent enforcement. How can administrators guarantee consistency among teachers within schools and even amongst multiple campuses given varying interpretations of policy language? It's crucial they understand expectations clearly. Can training sessions address potential disparities in application?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Excellent follow-up question, Kate. Consistency indeed lies at the heart of effective implementation. Addressing disparate interpretation requires multifaceted approach. Firstly, comprehensive professional development workshops focusing specifically on updated policies shall take place before next semester commences. These interactive sessions aim to provide educators clarity on expected standards, fostering open dialogue surrounding gray areas. Additionally, campus-specific meetings have been scheduled wherein department heads will collaborate to standardize procedures ensuring uniformity across subjects and grades. Lastly, regular check-ins via anonymous teacher evaluations will help identify potential inconsistencies allowing us to make adjustments accordingly. By tackling this issue head-on, we strive towards establishing trust and equity throughout our educational community."

    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "If I may interject briefly, I appreciate Ms.Osbourne's commitment toward providing support mechanisms for both instructors and pupils. However, considering recent budget constraints, could she elaborate on specific funding allocations dedicated to implementing such initiatives effectively? Transparency concerning resource distribution becomes increasingly vital under current financial circumstances."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Understandable concern, Kate. Given fiscal realities, prudent allocation of resources takes center stage. Allow me to assure you, we've carefully reassessed priorities, redirecting existing funds to bolster program efficacy. A significant portion \u2013 approximately $150,000 \u2013 has been reallocated from administrative overhead to directly fund educator training programs, including workshop facilitators, materials, and substitute coverage. Furthermore, we'll leverage partnerships with local organizations offering pro-bono consulting services focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion. This collaborative effort enables us to maximize impact while minimizing expenditure. Detailed breakdowns of allocated funds will be made publicly available on our website shortly, demonstrating transparency in our stewardship of district finances."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "That sounds reassuring, but I do hope detailed reports include information related to long-term sustainability plans once external grants expire. The last thing we want is another instance of well-intentioned projects being abandoned due to lack of continued financing."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Okay, my final comment - it seems there were two things mentioned by several speakers tonight. First, people wanted better communication between admin and families, especially after discipline issues arise. Second, many expressed desire for greater emphasis placed on social-emotional learning skills. Both resonate deeply because I think part of why kids act out stems from them struggling emotionally. What kind of SEL programming might look like should definitely factor heavily into decision-making processes. In terms of family engagement strategies, perhaps quarterly progress updates sent home detailing behavioral improvements along with academic ones could facilitate smoother relationships. Just throwing ideas out there."
