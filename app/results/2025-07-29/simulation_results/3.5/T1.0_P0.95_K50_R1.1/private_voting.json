    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I do have some questions about this math proposal. First, can you provide more information on the specific materials and how it differs from our current curriculum?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Ah, Kate, great question. I'd be happy to clarify. The proposed curriculum, \"Math Connects\", incorporates more interactive technology, including online simulations and games, to engage students and make complex concepts more accessible. In contrast, our current curriculum relies heavily on traditional textbooks. Additionally, Math Connects places greater emphasis on problem-solving and critical thinking through project-based learning, which aligns with the new state standards. We've also budgeted for professional development opportunities to ensure our teachers feel confident teaching these new methods. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspects, Kate?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Okay, thank you for explaining that, Ellen."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Kate, did you want me to share some examples of those project-based learning activities they've incorporated into the Math Connects curriculum? I think it might help illustrate how it differs from our current approach."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Yeah, Ellen, please go ahead, because I still am wondering about practical classroom implementation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "For instance, one example activity has students working in groups to design and propose a budget for a hypothetical amusement park ride. They'll apply mathematical concepts like ratios, proportions, and geometry to create a feasible plan, while also developing essential skills like collaboration, communication, and problem-solving. This type of real-world application helps students see the relevance of math in their everyday lives, making it more engaging and memorable. Would you like more specifics, Kate?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Now, I understand what you're trying to do, but does it also address basic skills such as multiplication tables and other arithmetic operations?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thank you. It just seems like we were told by several parents, though, who talked at public comment, that there's been less attention given to the foundational skills like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, reading, writing within these modern education practices. So I'm going to agree with what just got said."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "I think Katrina brings up an important point. As much as we value innovation and creativity, it seems crucial we don't sacrifice fundamental math skills in the process. Can someone explain to me how Math Connects addresses the development of these foundational skills alongside its focus on problem-solving and critical thinking?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "That is a wonderful illustration, Ellen. What are the metrics to show whether the results of this program are really being achieved after two, three years down the road? How can you hold us accountable for the use of taxpayer dollars for this particular item?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Absolutely, Katrina and David, I completely understand your concerns about ensuring our students have a strong foundation in basic skills. And, Jonno, excellent question about accountability.\n\nTo address your concerns, Math Connects actually embeds those foundational skills throughout the curriculum, often in the context of the project-based activities. For example, when students are designing that amusement park ride, they'll need to calculate dimensions, distances, and costs, applying those fundamental operations like multiplication and division in a meaningful way. The program also includes explicit lessons and exercises to reinforce those skills, so we're not sacrificing them in favor of critical thinking and problem-solving.\n\nRegarding metrics, we would track student progress through a combination of formative and summative assessments, as well as regular check"

    "content": "Hi everyone, I'd like to chime in on this discussion. I'm concerned about the level of parental involvement in Math Connects. Are there any opportunities for parents to get involved with their children's math homework or projects, perhaps through online platforms or volunteer opportunities in the classrooms?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I think that's a great question, Judy. One thing I worry about is what you mentioned -- getting parents engaged, and feeling comfortable enough with this new approach themselves. Could we discuss ways we could provide resources or support systems for families to better grasp Math Connects' core principles and participate effectively?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Ah, excellent questions, Judy and Kate. Parental involvement is indeed crucial for student success. With Math Connects, we envision parents playing an active role in supporting their child's learning journey. The program offers an online portal where parents can access resources, lesson plans, and project templates, enabling them to engage with their child's math work and offer guidance. Additionally, we're proposing teacher-led workshops and family math nights, where parents can learn about the Math Connects methodology and gain confidence in assisting their child. We believe this will not only foster a stronger home-school connection but also empower parents to become partners in their child's educational growth."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thank you, Ellen. A year ago, when you did say you had looked into some different math curricula, it was obvious to me that there wasn't much consensus about any of them. I know Dr. Wardynski mentioned last week he felt a bit more confident, I want to say. In terms of data backing those, do you feel like the administration does have a good understanding of what we do currently, and if we adopt Math Connects, where we're headed from now?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Well, Katrina, I appreciate your diligence in recalling our previous discussions on this topic. Indeed, we've invested significant time researching various math curricula, and while opinions may have varied initially, our administrative team has since coalesced around Math Connects due to its alignment with state standards and research-backed effectiveness. Regarding data, yes, we have a clear understanding of our current math performance metrics, including achievement gaps and areas for improvement. If we adopt Math Connects, we'll establish benchmarks to measure its impact over time, monitoring student progress and making adjustments as needed. Our goal is to ensure a smooth transition and maximize the benefits of this innovative approach."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Well Ellen, thank you for your response.  I am glad you recognize that we don't have all of the answers yet. But I just wanted to add one thing because I noticed it's something people keep bringing up, even though it might seem trivial to you guys. But these things really matter to parents. What kind of calculators are the kids gonna be using?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Ahah, Katrina, you're absolutely right! Calculators can be a sensitive topic for many parents! Let me assure you, we've considered this aspect carefully. With Math Connects, we're recommending a specific graphing calculator model that aligns with the program's focus on visualization and critical thinking. We'll provide training for teachers on its effective integration into lessons, and we'll also offer resources for parents to familiarize themselves with the calculator's features. Rest assured, we'll make sure our students develop a solid foundation in mental math and estimation skills while utilizing technology strategically to enhance their mathematical understanding."

    "content": "I am going back to something Mrs. Osborne said. It was one sentence out of her speech. She said that you see this method works everywhere you go and she was referring specifically to math education. I think that might be overstating, and I've seen enough math books to know that doesn't exist anywhere. My main concern here, Mrs. Osborne, is this, let's say this method isn't the end all and be all of methods for every child. And what I'm asking is do you envision a scenario where you start to see that a group of kids really struggling with this particular format of math education? Because that's a lot of kids who could potentially fail before they even get to geometry."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "I understand your concern, Katrina, and I appreciate your candor. You're right; I may have overspoken earlier. While research supports the effectiveness of Math Connects, I acknowledge that no single approach works equally well for every student. If implemented, we would closely monitor student progress, identifying early on which students might require additional support or alternative instructional strategies. Should we find a significant group of students struggling with this format, we would adapt and refine our instruction to meet their needs. This might involve supplementing Math Connects with other resources or approaches, ensuring we're providing multiple pathways for students to access and understand complex mathematical concepts. Our primary objective remains equipping each student with the skills and confidence they need to succeed in mathematics, regardless of"

    "content": "I completely understand your concern, Katrina. Perhaps my previous statement was overly broad. While Math Connects has shown promising results in various schools, I agree that there is no one-size-fits-all solution in math education. Every student learns differently, and it's essential we acknowledge that. To address your question directly, yes, I do envision a scenario where we identify students who struggle with this format. That's why it's crucial we maintain open communication channels between teachers, administrators, and parents to catch potential issues early on. By doing so, we can provide targeted interventions and adjust our instructional strategies to better serve those students. Our ultimate goal is to ensure every student has the opportunity to excel in math, regardless of their individual learning style."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Okay, so if for instance you find that you are getting consistently that feedback from a certain subset of kids who are saying \"I don't understand,\" then you know how to explain it to them.  My problem is trying to get to that point without leaving a bunch of kids in the dust."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Okay, so we're agreed, though. Ellen, the first thing that jumps out at me, as a lay person in education, seems to me you've got the right approach. You do have a pretty deep, wide range. Are you expecting us to approve two million bucks for this tonight?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Absolutely, Katrina, I understand your concerns about supporting students who may struggle with this new approach. We will prioritize ongoing professional development for our teachers, ensuring they're equipped to adapt their instruction and address diverse learning needs.\n\nAnd David, regarding your question, we're not asking for approval of the full $2 million tonight. Tonight, we're seeking approval to move forward with the next phase, which includes piloting Math Connects in select classrooms and conducting further research on its effectiveness in our district. The total cost for this initial pilot phase is approximately $200,000. If successful, we would then come back to the board for consideration of the full implementation budget."
