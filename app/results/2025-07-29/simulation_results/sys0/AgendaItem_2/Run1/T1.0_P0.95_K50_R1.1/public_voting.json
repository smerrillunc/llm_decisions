  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "I want to thank both Mr. Oberg and Ms. Callson for their opening comments. Thank you, everyone, for an incredibly insightful discussion so far today. I want to acknowledge that the annual costs associated with our one-to-one initiative go well beyond mere hardware or infrastructure investments. The costs of not making this investment, however, are steeper still \u2013 unfulfilled potential, stifled opportunity, and yet another generation left behind. Therein lies our moral imperative for securing the necessary funding while continuously striving to maximize our operational efficiencies and identifying areas ripe for potential revenue growth. One path forward might involve exploring additional local business partnerships to contribute toward our goals of closing the existing digital divide, supplementing our infrastructure costs. In my remarks tonight, I touched upon this collaboration being pivotal in addressing disparities. By sharing both our vision and commitment to digital equity, corporate partners, too, could help shoulder a portion of the financial burden. Further, we need to continue exercising fiscal prudence in identifying possible departmental reallocations or reductions unrelated to our priority objectives that do not negatively affect our core student programs. It is our job as stewards of the county's tax dollars to strike a responsible balance between budgetary discipline and allocating the necessary resources required to prepare every student for success in their chosen paths. I am confident if we continue down this collaborative path together that we shall uncover those elusive cost synergies and make the requisite difficult choices that benefit Albemarle County Public Schools students in the years ahead. Thank you for your questions, and please, let me offer any follow-up information that you require to further facilitate this discussion. And Ellen, could you offer any preliminary guidance about when our first set of 2022 and 2023 cohorts would begin receiving their devices and then a general timeline for full rollout at the high school level? For that matter, would each high school have their own device distribution timelines based upon site-specific logistics and planning, or would the introduction be more uniform in nature? And lastly, I wanted to pose two final questions. Are there any particular strategies under consideration to handle maintenance requirements and troubleshooting for students without home Wi-Fi and lacking reliable internet access, allowing them to return their faulty units during non-class hours at a physical location or exchange damaged equipment, for instance, before a new loaner unit becomes available? Second, within the overall annual costs discussed earlier, would device insurance constitute a line item in itself or fall beneath some broader category? Is it something to be covered"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, Graham, for your thoughtful response and suggestions for exploring alternative funding sources and cost-saving measures. Regarding the device rollout, our current plan is to introduce the program to the Class of 2023 in August 2022, followed by the Class of 2024 in August 2023. We anticipate a staggered rollout across high schools, taking into account individual school logistics and planning. In terms of maintenance and troubleshooting, we're considering partnering with local libraries or community centers to provide convenient drop-off locations for students without reliable internet access. Device insurance will indeed be a separate line item in our budget, ensuring we have a dedicated fund for replacing or repairing devices.
