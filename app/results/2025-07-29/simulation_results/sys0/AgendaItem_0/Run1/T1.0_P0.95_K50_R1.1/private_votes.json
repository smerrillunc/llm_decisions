    "comment": "Mr. Page. Dr. Acuff, I did, too, want to publicly acknowledge that Mr. Alcaro actually changed his vote based upon his own listening to the conversation in order to allow consensus in moving forward. I didn't want that moment lost when we tallied up the votes. But I thought that demonstrated great flexibility and growth mindset from Mr. Al-Caro. Thank you. Thank you very much. For this motion carried.\nkatrinacallsen: Mr. Page's closing remarks just concluded on this topic. Just as one closing remark, we are all grateful for every single person who took part today to participate in the school board discussion. Everyone deserves gratitude and many heartfelt thanks for your hard work from people across Albemarle County.\nkateacuff: Vice Chair Kauffman called tonight's final school board closed session, which is 11:25 PM and is hereby adjourned. Good night, Virginia.\nunknownspeaker: Good night. Is there anything you can do to stop another Zoom session from happening, or does Zoom control that? OKay, good. Bye-bye. All right. Good night everyone. There's another guy still up there. Who else is left in here? I see you still. See you later then. You can leave now. Goodbye. Goodnight. See you guys.\nunknownspeaker: Have a wonderful night. Oh good night, David. Thank you, everybody, on the call. Oh yeah, it sounds like all right now we've got that. Thanks.\nunknownspeaker: Hello there! Thank you to everyone who attended and participated in the board's deliberation session"
