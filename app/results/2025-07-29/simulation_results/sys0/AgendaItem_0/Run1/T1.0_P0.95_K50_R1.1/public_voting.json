    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.1: COVID Mask Policy - The board will discuss the district\u2019s COVID-19 health protocols, specifically whether students should be required to wear masks while in classrooms. This policy would apply during the regular school day, with exceptions for lunch and designated mask-break periods. The goal is to balance student safety with comfort and learning effectiveness.. Who would like to start?"

    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I would love to initiate our conversation on agenda item 3.1 regarding the district\u2019s updated mask-wearing policy in schools. In my view, an evidence-based and data-driven approach should guide us toward making a decision that safeguards both the health and educational needs of all students. Have we received any recent updates on local infection rates or scientific findings related to mask efficacy within our county and similar districts nationwide?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thank you, Katrina, for your thoughtful opening remarks. According to our administration, the current COVID case rate in our county remains at a moderate level, with a slight uptick over the past week. However, local health experts still recommend continued vigilance, particularly within high-density areas like schools. Perhaps, Kate, could you share insights from the medical community about mask-wearing efficacy in reducing transmission rates among children and adolescents, as well as potential drawbacks or concerns they may have about masking in educational settings?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "David and Katrina, thank you for setting the stage so effectively. To answer your question, David, several credible sources, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), consistently emphasize the crucial role face masks play in mitigating COVID-19 transmission, especially among children and teens. The consensus appears clear: properly worn face masks reduce transmission risks by approximately 50% or more when combined with other prevention strategies like distancing and hand hygiene. Of course, we must also consider potential drawbacks such as difficulties with communication and facial expressions during lessons. What are the preliminary thoughts from our panel members about striking an optimal balance between these competing factors? How can we maximize both student wellbeing and academic engagement?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "I appreciate Kate's comprehensive overview of the medical perspective. As we weigh the benefits and challenges of mask-wearing in schools, let's not forget our most vulnerable populations, such as immunocompromised students and those living in households with elderly or high-risk family members. Their safety and wellbeing must remain top priorities. I'd like to propose that we explore accommodations and exemptions on a case-by-case basis, ensuring equity and fairness while minimizing disruptions to their education. Additionally, have we considered the potential for virtual or hybrid alternatives for students who cannot wear masks due to medical conditions? This might provide an added layer of protection without compromising their access to quality education."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, Judy, for emphasizing the importance of considering our vulnerable student populations. Your proposal for case-by-case accommodations and exemptions resonates deeply with me. We must ensure our policies prioritize equity and inclusivity. Regarding virtual or hybrid alternatives, it's an excellent idea worth exploring further. Before we proceed, I'd like to add that our implementation strategy should involve robust communication with families, teachers, and students themselves. We need to educate our stakeholders about the importance of mask-wearing, while also providing support and resources for those who require special accommodations."

  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Ellen, your points around effective communication and support systems for all groups involved are crucial to successful implementation. Building trust through transparency and addressing the concerns of diverse stakeholders are critical components of this policy. Can we outline how we'll incorporate student voices into our final decision-making process? Including their perspectives will help ensure we're creating a solution that truly supports their health, wellbeing, and academic success. Furthermore, as we move forward, what kind of data collection and evaluation plan do we envision to monitor the impact of mask-wearing on transmission rates and our broader educational goals?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Jonno, I couldn't agree more on the importance of incorporating student voices and data-driven evaluation. To ensure authentic student representation, I suggest we establish a student advisory committee comprising diverse representatives from various grade levels and demographics. This group can provide invaluable feedback throughout the implementation process. Additionally, we should develop a comprehensive data collection and evaluation plan that tracks key metrics, such as COVID-19 transmission rates, student attendance, and academic performance, alongside surveys and focus groups to gauge student wellbeing and perception of the policy's impact. By doing so, we can refine our approach and make informed adjustments as needed."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Excellent suggestions, Ellen. A student advisory committee can offer unique insights and foster a sense of ownership among students, helping us better understand their experiences and adapt our policies accordingly. Incorporating both quantitative and qualitative metrics in our data collection and evaluation plan will provide a comprehensive picture of the policy's effects. It would be valuable to also track teacher feedback and wellness indicators, as they play a vital role in implementing the policy and supporting students. Could we schedule checkpoints every six weeks or so to review the collected data, discuss emerging trends, and make any necessary adjustments to the policy? This will allow us to stay nimble and responsive to the evolving needs of our students and staff."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I concur with Jonno's suggestion to regularly reassess our data and policy implementation, fostering adaptability and responsiveness to stakeholder needs. Six-week checkpoints seem reasonable, but let's discuss whether quarterly assessments would provide a more meaningful window into the policy's long-term impacts. Regardless, transparency throughout this process is essential; thus, I propose we dedicate a webpage on the school website to openly share relevant data, meeting minutes, and policy revisions to maintain open lines of communication with parents, teachers, and students alike."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Well said, Katrina! Regular reassessment and transparent communication are essential to building trust and ensuring our policy adapts to emerging needs. Quarterly assessments might indeed offer a clearer view of longer-term effects, and dedicating a webpage to updates, data, and meeting minutes is an excellent way to maintain openness. I'd also like to propose that we include a FAQ section and comment portal on the webpage to facilitate direct feedback from stakeholders. Perhaps, Graham, you could speak to the logistics of updating our crisis management protocols to reflect these changes and ensure seamless collaboration between school administrators, faculty, and local health authorities?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "David, an FAQ section and comment portal would certainly streamline two-way communication while helping alleviate concerns that arise. To address your request, I recommend assigning specific personnel to coordinate between local health officials, school administrators, and educators. This dedicated team will be responsible for tracking and disseminating timely updates to all parties involved, ensuring everyone remains well-informed throughout the pandemic response. In addition, their taskforce should regularly analyze emerging guidelines from organizations like CDC and AAP, adapting and refining our strategies in real-time. Our collective commitment to adaptability, empathy, and community connection has always defined us. Thank you for engaging with us today. Now, let's harness this shared purpose to create effective solutions tailored to the needs of each and every student. And as we continue this discussion, let's center on empowering students, acknowledging their capacity to learn amid adversity and flourish despite ongoing challenges. With a united spirit, we will rise above these unprecedented times, forging unbreakable bonds within the Albemarle County Public School system.  Ellen, since there seems to be no additional questions or points at this time, we might now officially conclude our deliberation session. I hope our productive exchange of ideas today fosters fruitful conversations as our board evaluates mask requirements moving forward. Once again, thank all of you for participating. Now, we look forward to the next regular meeting when the superintendent, Dr. Haas, formally presents the updated ACPS mask policy before seeking official board approval. Thank you.   And Ellen, again thank you to our board leadership for hosting this session. I am reminded of some powerful words expressed by Judy earlier today. Each voice, along with their story, matters. Please feel free to use that powerful statement within our deliberation. All voices matter here today. On behalf of all my central office colleagues and I thank all participants, and I wish everyone a safe remainder to your day. Thanks, Ellen. Good evening.  judyle: Thank you, Mr. Page. As we close, I invite fellow board members and guests to express gratitude to Mr. Page, Dr. McLaughlin, Ms. Schmidt, Ms. Kamras, their staffs, and everyone whose tireless efforts made today's information-rich discussion possible. Many heartfelt thanks go out from the entire county for your incredible work.  Goodnight, Virginia. It is 8:58. Ellen Osborne moved, vice-chair Dr. Kate Acuff seconded. So it is agreed to adjourn.

However, we would get the second reading in two weeks at which time we can still approve them based on Dr. Acuff's report.\nI do not think that accepting this plan for the agenda is a problem because by that time, in two meetings, we'll be able to work through a lot of things during these two weeks that we've got.\nI'm going to vote yes on this proposal. I don't know whether you want to make some other adjustments like we tried to do last time with different segments but that's what I thought too when this was brought to me.\nSo again, just speaking personally because we didn't discuss it.\nNo matter what happens after tonight, I hope that we may get it next week so we could decide this whole thing. Because right now, it's an hour past 11, and we have got a few things left to consider, the board being one of those items, and several other issues that require us having at least two weeks notice. The sooner I know something is gonna happen in two weeks, the better off I am because it causes less problems within ACPS if we can get away with doing things a little bit quicker than later.\nAnd my last question is for Mr. Page that has nothing really to do with the item here but we discussed at the executive committee today how we could be more efficient with our own meetings, particularly for people out in the room that maybe aren't interested about hearing 35 minutes of public comment where a person says the same thing five times because they had to sign up five times.\nNow we can always shut down things early if necessary, but right now with Zoom not working very effectively, we have a major problem. For example, tonight and I hate bringing up technology but this does count. It counts both ways with this.\nWe've already used over three gigabytes and it's not gonna be much longer until it reaches the limit that we normally use and then what happens? Then it stops working for everyone but nobody knows why it stopped working except  Maybe someone might.\nThere's a lady with AT&T, she lives right behind me in my neighborhood that could tell you in one day she went through six megabits per second. And this was an AT&T line.  Well, this morning she said we used half a megabit per"
