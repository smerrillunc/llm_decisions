However, we would get the second reading in two weeks at which time we can still approve them based on Dr. Acuff's report.\nI do not think that accepting this plan for the agenda is a problem because by that time, in two meetings, we'll be able to work through a lot of things during these two weeks that we've got.\nI'm going to vote yes on this proposal. I don't know whether you want to make some other adjustments like we tried to do last time with different segments but that's what I thought too when this was brought to me.\nSo again, just speaking personally because we didn't discuss it.\nNo matter what happens after tonight, I hope that we may get it next week so we could decide this whole thing. Because right now, it's an hour past 11, and we have got a few things left to consider, the board being one of those items, and several other issues that require us having at least two weeks notice. The sooner I know something is gonna happen in two weeks, the better off I am because it causes less problems within ACPS if we can get away with doing things a little bit quicker than later.\nAnd my last question is for Mr. Page that has nothing really to do with the item here but we discussed at the executive committee today how we could be more efficient with our own meetings, particularly for people out in the room that maybe aren't interested about hearing 35 minutes of public comment where a person says the same thing five times because they had to sign up five times.\nNow we can always shut down things early if necessary, but right now with Zoom not working very effectively, we have a major problem. For example, tonight and I hate bringing up technology but this does count. It counts both ways with this.\nWe've already used over three gigabytes and it's not gonna be much longer until it reaches the limit that we normally use and then what happens? Then it stops working for everyone but nobody knows why it stopped working except  Maybe someone might.\nThere's a lady with AT&T, she lives right behind me in my neighborhood that could tell you in one day she went through six megabits per second. And this was an AT&T line.  Well, this morning she said we used half a megabit per"
