    "comment": "Given the ongoing pandemic situation and guidance from public health officials, requiring masks indoors serves as a reasonable measure to minimize transmission risks within our educational settings, particularly among unvaccinated minors. I weigh my decision by considering the safety and well-being of our students and employees alongside our responsibility to provide continuous education without compromising health standards."

    "comment": "yes. We now announce whether the motion passed. The motion carries seven zero as did previous motions. What that does is allows the superintendent to continue requiring indoor masking in accordance with that rule throughout the year. If there's any change from the county level, then he would report back to the board to see if we needed any other adjustments.\nNext item would be the board announcements. Would you like to offer anything about something you'd like everyone to know? We could start over here and go around quickly please? It's not supposed to be too long.  And thank you. Thank you, Dr. Acuff, in advance for providing information through all of these issues in which we are working out our pandemic protocols. Your hardworking administrative employees, Mr. Harper, appreciate\nall of those who are helping him to be successful. So with appreciation, I just wanted to point that out for sure. Thank you, Dave and team, very much. And especially also, and I didn't even mention, I'm sorry, my administrative assistants who help me with some of my stuff too. So thank you guys for what you do for them all across the division to work for them. They really get little pay. That's it. Ms. Colson, your item from the consent agenda?\nkatrinacallsen: Yes. Thank you very much for reminding all of us of such great folks behind the scenes working super diligently.  I really want to acknowledge that Dr. McLaughlin and I attended today at Monticello"
