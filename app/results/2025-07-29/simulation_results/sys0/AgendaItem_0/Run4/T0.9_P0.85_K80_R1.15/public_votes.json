    "comment": "Okay, thank you, Mr. Page. All of those who voted yes by roll call were Mrs. Carlson, Dr. Acuff, Ms. Lee, Miss Colson, Mr. Alcaro, Mr. Oberg, Ms. Osborne, Mr. Yes. The motion passes. We'll move to our moment for celebration.\nellenosborne: I was going to ask if we could make an exception because these three student reps can't come next week with us. Are there any other people? No?\njonnoalcaro: Can I add just a quick second about Mr. Koleszar from Monticello High School? Just really impressed with his ability to connect with students, teachers, parents, and administrators in the building, creating a welcoming environment through various ways, but especially his morning announcements. He makes sure that kids feel seen, heard, valued, et cetera. Also, just kind of giving props to him for stepping into this role, being so willing to learn how he can better serve the community, just in general doing everything possible to help out and just being a supportive colleague to everyone else in the school. So thanks, Mr. Colsar. You're absolutely welcome. Thank you again, everyone. Well, thanks to both of them. Anybody else? Anything anyone wants to say or share during this session? That does bring up questions about when graduation might take place. We don't know yet because of COVID restrictions. If they continue like they are now, then we would probably not be able to hold graduations indoors, which has been the traditional way of doing things. So there may need to be adjustments made based on the information we get later in April regarding whether or not we can use the John Paul Jones Arena again this year or any other indoor space.\nkatrinacallsen: In fact, we got some good news today. We did receive permission from UVA to potentially host ceremonies at Scott Stadium. And so we're working on exploring that option currently. So that's good news, at least. One thing I wanted to mention is the National Merit Finalists announcement came out yesterday, and Albemarle County Public Schools had six finalists named. Congratulations to Western's Emily Chen, Charlottesville City's Alexander Chang"
