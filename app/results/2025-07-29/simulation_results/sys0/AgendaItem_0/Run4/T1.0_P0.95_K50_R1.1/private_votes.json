    "comment": "Yes.  I am done. It looks like we all have voted, Dave? Would you mind reading our votes out loud, and tell us the outcome?\nunknownspeaker: OK, I see Ellen as yes, Jackson, Graham says yes. Ms. Acuff, are you all set, too, though it won? I guess so.\ndanburke: Can I ask how many votes we received? We're just getting votes off screen. So Dave wants me to read his, right? Ellen, yes. Jackson, yes, Graham, yes. Dave, no. Mr. Page, yes, Mrs. Coates, yes. A couple of minutes left for Mr. Alcaro. John, yes. So it was eight or nine board members voted yes, two abstaining members who were present, one nonparticipating due to technical difficulties. It was a yes. It carries by consent resolution to put the motion into effect immediately after approval tonight. All right, Mr. Oberg. Yeah, just real quickly. I wanted to clarify something before we actually take that action, so that the staff knows. Do they get to implement whatever measures they would like? Is that what the resolution is saying? Or is there anything specifically they are being directed to do?\nkateacuff: Well, to add onto that, Graham. Based on what you said, what I would have seen in the slide deck today, so as far as implementation goes, I would hope that in our first week of doing this, all of that can be kind of clarified. But just to speak to Ellen's concern about timing. I believe when we discussed earlier in our school day, what we did not really talk about today, and maybe this could be answered by the person reading later, did anyone on staff know or have information prior to the school year beginning, this is coming up because of the way we dealt with this last time. Did anyone have a heads-up in advance to plan accordingly, even informally? Because it sounded like this came very quick.\nmatthew"
