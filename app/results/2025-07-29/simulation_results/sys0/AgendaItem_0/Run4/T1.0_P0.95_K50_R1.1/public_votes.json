    "comment": "yes\nunknownspeaker: All right. That motion passes eight yeses, zero nos. And we did ask Dr. McLaughlin if he could join us tonight during closed session, and Dr. has joined us now and so it looks like since everyone's voted that we're ready to move into our closed session. So let me just check one second and make sure there's no other items that anyone needs brought up. Any motions?  Or further discussion about our special item? No? Okay. All right.  Are we at the point where we can go to closed session? So now what we're going to do is follow again the advice that we've had given to us from Albemarle County. We will go out one by one and announce in open session whether we'd like to vote to have an executive session because it takes six affirmative votes from the elected officials to go into an executive session.  Mr. Al Carillo, please go ahead and call roll again. OK., Mrs. Johnson? Ms. Lee?  Yes. Dr. Acuff? Yes. Ms. Colson? Yes. Mr. Page? Yes. Miss Osborne? Yes, sir. Mr. Oberg, yes. So we will now go into closed session. Our motion will include all three parts, which would be three A three B and three C. And as far as any action out of our closed sessions, once again, in light of this unusual meeting of the board and the fact that we won't meet until the next meeting, all business having to do with what we discuss tonight will be held over for approval to a different date unless we take that up then.  This board will now enter into our session at seven minutes past seven and now that our motion to continue has passed, we'll give Dr. Haas a minute or two while the first time tonight when we met and also after we took our break, both of these gentlemen were still in our zoom. So I'm assuming they may well stay there. They may not know they are there. I'm gonna bring this up, but hopefully one way or the other it doesn't cause a problem and I'll try it the second time. There, Dr. Hass, I don't know. All right"
