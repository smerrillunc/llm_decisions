    "comment": "Mr. Chair, could I ask just real quick about how many people were involved in helping us get ready for today since they're not named specifically within either document? There may be other staff members who helped out quite significantly behind the scenes. Is there any way we can give thanks to each person individually without naming names if nothing else through email communication later down the road? Or maybe even something publically thanking folks during another meeting sometime soon? Because certainly their efforts did make things go smoothly enough where we didn't really hear anything negative coming back yet anyway. But yeah, please let me know whether that might happen anytime soon. OK, sorry. That being said, move approval of both items A1 and B4. Seconded by Mrs. Lee. Any further discussion on the motion? If none then Miss Johnston, could you pull up poll question six, please? Polling question seven, excuse me. Okay, miss johnston, could you read off the results of polling questions five and six? Sure thing. For poll question five, dr acuff voted yes. Vice-chair carlson voted yes. Ms colson voted yes. Ms delcarmen voted yes. Dr huffman voted yes. Ms lee voted yes. Ms osborn voted yes. Mr page voted yes. Mr alcarro voted yes. Motion carried. On poll question six, mr ackoff voted yes. Vice chairman karlsen voted yes. ms kelson voted yes. mrs dalceman voted yes. dr Huffman voted yes. ms lea voted yes. ms ozburne voted yes. mr paej voted yes. jon oscar voted yes. Motion carries.
