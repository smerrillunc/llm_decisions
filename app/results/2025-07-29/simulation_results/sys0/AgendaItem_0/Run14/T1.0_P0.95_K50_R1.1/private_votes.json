    "comment": "Yes.  Is everyone done? I will close the poll now. Okay. Let me just tabulate. OK, let's read out the votes. Yes, Kate Acuff. Dr. Auerbach-Cooke votes yes. Ellen Osborne also votes yes. David Rieger votes yes. Judy Lee, yes. Ms. Digilio votes yes. And Mr. Oberg also votes yes. There were no nos. So by an eight zero count, the motion passes. We've had an opportunity to review those motions. So now I'm going to ask each of you to vote a second time on item 3.3.  But prior to asking you to vote, Ellen, I see you're raising your hand. Do you want to comment or simply clarify something?  And if you're going to speak first, maybe you could mute yourself after you hit unmute so it goes green so others don't accidentally interrupt you. Go ahead, Ellen."
