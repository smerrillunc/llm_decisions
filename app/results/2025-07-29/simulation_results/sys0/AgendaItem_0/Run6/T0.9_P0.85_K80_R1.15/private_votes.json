    "comment": "Yeah.\ngrahama: All right, we have seven votes. There were four votes in favor of moving to optional mask wearing within the school setting starting February 21st, two opposed and one person chose to abstain. The motion passes.\nkatrinacallsen: Can I ask one question?\nunknownspeaker: I didn't hear you say, Graham, which way you went, just for clarity.\ngrahampage: OK, so I apologize about that mistake earlier. I did vote against the measure.\nmatthewhaas: Sorry, I had to mute myself again.\nunknownspeaker: That was quite the little break-out session. Yeah, we're back. All right, thank you very much.\nkateacoffman: I guess I just want to make sure because we don't have an actual motion written down that captures everything we've talked about tonight. Is our intent going to be then at next week's meeting, you'll have that formal motion written up based on the notes taken today that includes everything from  Ms. Del Caro's first email all the way until now? Yes. Or do we still need something else?\nellenosborne: You mean I get another week reprieve on my homework assignment?\nkateacoffman: Well, maybe not reprieve because we need that motion at least.\nunknownspeaker: Right. Right, right.\njonnoalcaro: Okay, great, thanks, Kate. So yeah, to confirm, my job will be to write up a formal motion and supporting documentation reflecting all of the discussions that have occurred since last Monday up through today. Correct.\nkateacoffman: That's correct, John. And I think for the rest of us who won't know exactly how we'll feel until then, that motion itself is probably important. And certainly we're hoping that there might be something posted prior to that Thursday meeting so people can review it in advance. But we definitely, for all intents and purposes, we need a formal motion.\njonnoalcaro: All right, got it. Okay, great. Thanks, everybody.\nkatrinacallsen: Just for future clarification too, even though I've heard Mr. Page's name called many times in this time period, that he actually said his own name as being a negative vote for that particular situation. So that may help clear up anything later down"
