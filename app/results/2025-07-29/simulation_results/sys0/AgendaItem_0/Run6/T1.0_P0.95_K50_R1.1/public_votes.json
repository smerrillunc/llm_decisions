    "comment": "yes.  All right, I have motion by Mr. Oberg seconded by Ms. Lee moved  and passed seven times zero. Thank you very much, and now we move to our  The superintendent's report. Dr. Haas. Very nice to see her. We're going to watch and see what kind of things she will talk about tonight. She always has so many good ones. All right. Is there any more from our assistant superintendents?  Yes, Dave. You got something to say. Dave, do you want me to take off my mask if you want the microphone again too? Oh, wait, it was your thought. No, I'm fine, thank you. I just wanted to mention that next week, actually today and tomorrow, students could sign up for their high school orientations in the middle school buildings. They would go to their own feeder pattern's middle school building, not necessarily their home building but their feeder pattern's middle school building. So students could attend afternoons, afternoon sessions will start at 2 p.m., afternoon session ends at three, and then 5 until 6 in both evenings. And all of those details were shared out with teachers and staff via email.  And so we'll look forward to welcoming those students in orientation, which is important because they come back and help us run the morning. And the last, as you said, student rep is also welcome for their first board meeting for every new board year. Is that right, Jack? Right? Absolutely. Absolutely. Thanks. And I did not realize that. Okay, Mr. Rude, if you'd like me to give back to you, please let us know. OK. Any other items that any of the other staff has a minute before it goes through you?\nalliekozic: I just wanted to note that during the past week, since our last board meeting, Albemarle County had 12 reported cases with an attack rate that ranged anywhere between.24 per thousand to six point 10 per thousand. All of that information was shared at the last Board of Supervisors meeting. And so if you want access to that data or presentations, please feel free to reach out to Dr. B. Or I can share it too"
