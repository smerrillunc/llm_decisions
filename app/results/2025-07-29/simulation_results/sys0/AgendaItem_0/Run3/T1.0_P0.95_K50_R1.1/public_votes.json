Anybody want to move to move that we end today's meeting? Second?\nunknownspeaker: I second.\nkatrinacallsen: Do we now have an opportunity to give comment to tonight's session, if they would like to do comments? No, there's nothing for us.\ngrahampaige: OK, thank you.  Motion to move that we finish out today's meeting. The second by Mr. Alcaro. Right? Any discussion over the motion?  Now I'll ask for a roll call.\njonnoalcaro: yes\nellanosborn: Yes. Davey?\ndavidoberg: Yes, sir. Yes. Ms. Le? Ms. Lee? Okay, Dr. Acuff.  And I'd say yes too. Of course, the moment has ended. We wish the best luck to our graduating class.\nellenosborne: Congratulations!\ngrahampaige:  and to all their families, friends, teachers, who helped them through these last four years, wishing you the absolute very best in this time for whatever each one of you does in the future.\njonnoalcaro: Thanks, John, everyone. Good job on your last regular day before graduation. To both of you, I have the floor again at 1:45 tomorrow when we sign the documents. Then later at about 2:30 after signing those documents, you're all welcome to join us in the next room where we would certify election results officially and  and swear in the new administration then. At the next school board meeting that same day starting at 5 o'clock, you can start your official duties. Just so you know, though, some of us might still recognize you when we see you because they probably know how you look, but it'll still be different after you"
