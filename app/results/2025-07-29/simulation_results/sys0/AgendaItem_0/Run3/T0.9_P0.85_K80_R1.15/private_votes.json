I am going to vote yes.\nunknownspeaker: And I guess we're not doing the chat anymore.\njonnoalcaro: Yeah, sorry about that.  Okay, my vote was yes.\ngrahampaige: So Mr. Al-Karo said yes. Miss Osborne-Gilbert? Did you vote? You didn't put anything down there.\nellanosbornegilbert: Oh, I apologize, I forgot. My vote is no.\njonhouseright:  I voted yes.\nkatrinacallsen: I voted yes. Thank you.\ngrahampaje: So the motion carries out six votes in favor and two against. Now if we could see the second round. I don't know what happened there. There we go. We were talking about item three point two. So does anyone wish to move forward that one or do you want to leave that one? Or perhaps leave number four open? Any discussion about agenda items 3.2 through 4.0? We still got time left to talk if someone wants to bring something up.\nunknownspeaker: I can bring up the next thing.\nunknownspeaker: I wanted to do a few more motions, because we only had five minutes left when we talked about this previously, and that was kind of short-circuited. And then also because our first and third graders, you know, really deserve a chance to look into this further, so.\nkateacuff: Well, wait. Wasn't there another motion on the table before you jumped in again?\njonnoalcaro: I mean, actually, I moved that one already. I moved the last motion based on the conversation.\ngrahampaige: Is there a second on his motion?\nellenosbornegilbert: I'll second it.\ngrahampaige: Seconded. Any discussion on that motion?"
