    "comment": "Yes  Okay, so now since I voted last, it means there is a motion passed by consensus of our School Board to approve our student representative seat addition at tonight's meeting. So thank you, John. We appreciate your time. And again, thanks to both of you, Ms. Colson and Ms. Carlson, for bringing this forward to us. With that being approved by motion through the consent agenda, this does conclude the items that were presented to us this evening through our consent agenda. If anything further comes up or any additional actions are required later in the session, they would come back forth from each board member and go across in front of me in order according to what board members bring forward. At the end, then we close out this segment with another motion. Are there other motions? Does anyone else want to make a motion? Is there any other business relative to our approval part of our meeting this morning? In which case, if you're not seeing or hearing anything after an opportunity for all members to share their thoughts and ideas, Ms. Johnston, could I ask that you move we now proceed and adjourn our closed session?\nkatrinacallsen: Yes. Yes, Mr. Page. It was moved by Mrs. Lee, seconded by Ms. Osborne that we approve those five motions together, but also include the appointment of a school rep to the ACEDI Committee.\nunknownspeaker: Second.\nkateacuff: Was the vote unanimous?  OK, great. All righty. Any new business? Did anybody have something on their mind that didn't get mentioned earlier? No. Then what did he just say?\ngrahampaige: He said to put in motion.\nkateacuff: Oh, okay. Do you remember what the words were when you were sitting in Mr. Carvallo's place?\njonnoalcaro: Yeah. Sure, sure.\nkateacuff: You'd like to practice on"
