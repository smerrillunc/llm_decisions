    "comment": "And after listening to all this great input from everyone else around here tonight, I'm going to go ahead with what we've heard so far too because there was nothing really new added by Mr. Page at least not anything different than he has said previously about his concerns over these two items being pulled out separately rather than just having them included within the entire package which would make more sense if they were part of an overall plan but since they're standalone motions then maybe doing something like Dr. Acuff suggested might work better where those who want could sign up individually without any pressure either way anyway given everything i guess im still voting yes\nvote Yes. The motion passes unanimously. We'll now move into closed session. So let me read us back through Virginia State Code Section 2341 Exclusion Of Public From Meeting Where Certain Matters Will Be Discussed While This Ordinance Is In Effect But Only For That Portion Of A Closed Session Concerning Business At Issue Under Subsection One Or Two Hereof Should Not Have Been Unexpectedly Deferred To Another Day By Anyone Other Than Requester Through Whom It Was Scheduled Without Good Cause Shown All Impracticable Alternatives Considered Prior Notice Having Been Given During Any Open Session Held Six Working Days Before Such Special Called Meeting Being Reasonably Expected Could Thereafter Actually Have Taken Place Giving Due Weightage As May Differ Among Multiple Appellants Acting Alone On Particular Requests Made Known Same Number Of Days Hence Were They Opposed Otherwise Join Motions Must Identify With Precision What Would Needlessly Delay Hearing On Deferment Rightfully Needed Today Until Tomorrow Anyway Since No Order Can Prolong Deferral Past Close Of Third Consecutive Meets Following Planning Stages Announcement Nor Shall Anything Above Prevent Minimally Viable Alternative Option Available When Unavoidable Disruption Beyond Practicability Has Occurred Which Doesnt Allow Us Time To Post Within Deadline Set Out Below If Youre Going Into Executive Session Then Please Turn Off Your Camera Microphone First Vice Chair Carlson Do Either Of Our Board Members Who Are Participating Virtually Want To Make Sure Their Cameras Mics Are Completely Disabled? OK Well See Whether Thats True Once Again Let Everybody Check Yourselves Real Quick Just Like Last Week Because Sometimes Zooms Default Settings Might Automatically Reenable Them Even Though Youve Tried Turning Everything Down Alright Everyone Ready Okay Great Motion Mrs Lee Second Miss Colson Discussion Seeing None Madam Secretary Could You Call Roll Graham Paige Dave Oberg Ellen Osborn John Alcareau Judy Lee Katrina Coul"
