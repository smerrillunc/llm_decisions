    "comment": "yes. Are there any other votes coming in? If so, just put them in the chat. It looks like we have seven votes, and that includes Mr. Alcaro and Ms. Colson who haven't voted yet. Please go ahead and enter your votes. OK, thank you very much. Our vote is eight to zero. So our motion carries. We will implement a two-week trial period of masking mandates starting on Monday, September 20th, and then revisit this matter after that for further evaluation. Next item, if we could pull the agenda items back onto the screen again for us, next item is agenda item number three point two. Motion approval of the consent agenda. Could we pull it down? OK, what else do we want to do? Do either of you gentlemen want to call out something from the consent agenda that maybe needs some discussion or pull off for separate action? Seeing none, is there a motion to approve the entire consent agenda? Do I hear a second? OK, motion by Mr. Oberg, second by Mrs. Lee. Is there any discussion on the motion? All right, hearing none, let me remind the folks who called in tonight that unless otherwise noted, every item on the consent agenda carries unanimous approval of the board. There was no mention of abstentions. And Ms. Johnston, I will just say on behalf of everybody here that it was absolutely tremendous to see you being introduced to the board and serving as principal. We really appreciate all the service and hope all the best for your future endeavors. With the motion moved and seconded by Ms. Del Caro, I'm going to now take a roll call vote on that approval of the consent agenda. Dr. Acuff, could you start calling roles? Dr. Acoop, yes. Yes, okay. Yes, OK, Mr. Oberg?  Yes, all right. Ms. Lee?  Ms. Johnston, yes. Yes, I am too. Yes. The approval carries. Motion approved unanimously by acclimation, excuse me. Any board members having a conflict of interest? Any board members wishing to speak on"
