So I'll be serving on the teacher cabinet. So I guess there's nine teachers all across the state, but really excited about the opportunity.\njonnoalcaro: Outstanding! Congratulations!\njudyle: Dr. Acuff, do you want us to stand up or clap when they make their introduction or not?\ndavidoberg: You know what we could do for sure, Mr. Chair? We're gonna get the names from them and then we can have people introduce themselves after the video presentations or introductions.\nellenosborne: OK.  Thanks for letting me change that, Dr. Obeng-Effah.\njennycarriganmartin: OK. That is fine. You guys go ahead. I just wanted him to do it because he's the assistant principal in charge. So, please, thank you very much. Please, Mr. Page. You might want to put this down on your computer screen.\nkatrinacallsen: Sorry, Mr. Martin and I were talking, saying that maybe next week would be better, given where we are within the process. If you do, you know, next week at the end of our meeting will still work good. It was okay with them. Is next Thursday good with you?\ndavidoberg: Yes. As far as I know right now.\nunknownspeaker: Sounds perfect.\nkatrinacallsen: Well, it certainly seems like a lot of folks are taking steps into the holiday season. So maybe even on top of that, our holiday wish message that day also. So I look forward to seeing you all, probably virtually, next week.\nkate"
