    "comment": "Yes. I simply want to reiterate the importance of having a single voice representing our collective efforts. Synthesizing all the reports is quite daunting, and consolidating everything into a single package will allow us to have focused discussions rather than jumping between different documents.\njennycollison: And I just wanted to say that as much as we hate to create more positions or roles, I think that this is important, too. It doesn't necessarily have to be a permanent position. But I definitely think we need some sort of central coordinator person for now until we get through all of this stuff.\njonnoalcaro: My initial reservations were whether we had capacity within the administrative team. Upon hearing more details, I believe the synthesis subgroup will significantly aid in streamlining our workflow and keeping everyone informed of key issues requiring action. It provides valuable consistency across the working groups and bolsters trust with our constituents.\nunknownspeaker: Katrina? Unknown Speaker: Katrina? jonnoalcaro: Go ahead, Mrs. Osborne. ellenosborne: Can you remind me what the vote was, Mr. Page? Okay. So we have eight yeses and one abstention. And so since it was an action item and seven plus is needed for passage, then the motion passes. The motion passes.\njonnoalcaro: Many thanks to Katrina, David, Kate, Judy, and Ellen for this robust discussion and concrete actions. Establishing the synthesis subgroup under Katrina's guidance will bring order and focus to our collective efforts. Sharing the consolidated report, complete with an executive summary, ahead of our next meeting ensures we're all adequately prepared for informed decision-making. As we advance, let's emphasize the need for clear communication channels among the subgroup members to prevent duplication of efforts and integrate perspectives seamlessly. Furthermore, I recommend scheduling dedicated time during our upcoming meeting to deliberate on the synthesized recommendations, allocate sufficient time for questions, and address any concerns raised by board members. How does this approach resonate"
