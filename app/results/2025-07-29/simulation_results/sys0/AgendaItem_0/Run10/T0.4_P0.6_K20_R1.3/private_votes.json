    "comment": "Yes. Okay, thank you very much. And finally, Ms. Colson?\nunknownspeaker: OKay. So I'm going to go back real quick. All right, Mr. O'Berg, did he say anything? Oh yeah, sorry. He voted yes. Miss Carlson-Delfino says she votes yes. Mrs. Lee does not respond. She doesn't know her answer either. But anyway, okay, so then Miss Osborne didn't do hers correctly. Her response wasn't correct. Then Mr. Oburg voted yes. Yeah, sure thing. Sure thing. Sorry, everybody. My apologies. You guys were talking way faster than I could type. Anyway, five people voted yes. Two people voted no. There was two unknowns. Right. Well, actually three unknowns cause Ellen never got recorded properly. That means motion passes unanimously based off of seven total voters having six affirmative responses required per Robert Rules Order. Motion passed. Is that good? Good job. Great work. Now onto agenda item number four announcements. Do any board members have any announcements? Anything happen recently that happened lately that you want to share with us? Nothing happening locally? Not really. Just wanted to remind folks that Friday night lights return starting September 10th. They start at Albemarle High School versus Monticello. Also, Western starts its season Saturday afternoon. Both games kick off at 7 o'clock PM. Or maybe it kicks off at 5 pm. Check the website. Please check the ACPS athletic webpage for details. Other things include the Charlottesville City Schools Board Retreat scheduled Thursday evening beginning at 6 p.m., August 26th. A Zoom link appears below. Another upcoming event includes the Virginia Association of Counties Annual Conference taking place Labor Day weekend. Registration information follows immediately beneath the retreat notice. Forgive me, John. Did you miss something? Wasn't there supposed to be a VEA conference call Monday morning? Ah, thanks for catching that. At least according to email received yesterday, the VEA Virtual Town Hall takes place Sunday, Aug."
