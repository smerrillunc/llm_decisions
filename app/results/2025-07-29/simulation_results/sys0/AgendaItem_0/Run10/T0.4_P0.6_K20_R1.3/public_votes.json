    "comment": "And after listening to all this good information from Dr Acuff about what we're doing with these funds, I'm very pleased at how they've come together so quickly during COVID times when there was such an emergency situation here locally within Albemarle County Public Schools. So thank you again, Mr. Page. It has not gone unnoticed by me personally because I know he had some other things going on too but still managed to get us through those tough days back then. But anyway, moving forward now into next year, looking ahead towards FY23, which starts July first, just like every single county department does their own work session presentation over time period where each department presents its needs based upon strategic plan goals set forth by both city council and also supervisors who fund them along with ourselves since we do receive revenue sharing dollars from local government entities around $1 million annually. We did hear last week from two departments already presenting theirs' presentations. Tonight though, we'll focus solely on ACPS itself beginning with division overview presented tonight by superintendent Haas followed up later on down below agenda item number three point zero five dot four dash six slash twenty-two update regarding current fiscal year status plus forecasted revenues expenditures ending June thirtieth. Then finally wrapping everything altogether once more would be proposed operating budget coming out of committee meeting held earlier today.

As always, please note that nothing official gets adopted until adoption night scheduled March thirdrd. This evening serves primarily informational purposes only providing opportunity discuss ask questions make sure everyone understands exactly why certain decisions got reached while others didn't quite fit into picture yet. With that said, let's move onto slide seven titled introduction page containing quote unquote summary statement found near bottom left hand corner stating purpose behind entire exercise.
