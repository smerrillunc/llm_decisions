    "comment": "Yes. The motion passes unanimously by seven zero vote to approve this particular resolution. Are there any other motions? OK, I don't hear any others, so at that point we can go into closed session according to Virginia law section 22nd dash one dash 29 four, subdivision three. We're gonna do two separate closed sessions now since I'll say they were read out at first, but 7b1  and A4. In each case, we move that we convene in a closed meeting as authorized by the provisions set forth in an identified section of the Virginia Freedom Information Act in the motion identifier by Mr. Alcaro seconded by Dr. Acuff discussed by Mrs. Carlson and voted on unanimously by all board members who are seated around the dais who are eligible. So the chair declares this meeting by unanimous consent by seven zero vote, which was already established back then as being closed for business transacted while the closed meeting was convened. No one made a motion to certify by recorded vote that to the best of each board member's knowledge only public business matters lawfully exempted from the open meeting requirements of the Virginia Freedom Information Act and identified in the motion authorizing the closed meeting were heard, discussed, or considered in the closed meeting by reading from a piece of paper from our clerk. Is there a motion to come out of closed session?\nunknownspeaker: I move that the Albemarle County Public School Board certified by recorded vote that to the best of each school board members' knowledge, only public business matters legally exempted from the open meeting requirement of the Virginia Freedom of Information Act and identified in the motion authorizing the closed meeting were heard, discussed, or considered in the closed meeting.  written motion was offered by Mr. Oberg, seconded by Dr. Kate Acuff, as duly adopted in a roll call vote by the following members voting yea, Mr. John O. Alcaro, Ms. Katrina Coulson, Ms. Judy Lee, Mr. Dave Oberg, Ms. Ellen Osborne, Ms. Jennifer L. Schmidt. The minutes of this meeting should reflect that this motion was passed by order of the chairman. And he declared this November the 12th, 2020"
