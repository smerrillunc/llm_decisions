    "comment": "yes. \nunknownspeaker: Okay, moved by Mr. Alcaro. Is there any further discussion? I'll wait till I get everything on there from here on out. All righty then we now have our poll taken so thank you very much Kate Acuff, seconded by Vice Chair Carlson and I can go read off those who voted in favor and those who were opposed, but that does not appear necessary tonight because I am reading seven yeses. It is passed by unanimous consent. Are there any other agenda items? At our last meeting, Mr. Page, you said that you wanted to bring forward at least two items and perhaps additional items of discussion at this session of our board. And Dr. Haas, do you have something you'd like to bring up? No. Anything else Mr. Page? Yeah, I would kind of like the opportunity to discuss these five items that I brought out of my pocket. And we didn't put it on the agenda in order to provide time for all of our board members who might bring things up for future meetings.  All right. And how about from our student rep? Yes. Do you want to tell us what some of them are or shall we guess? OK. Number one was about our facilities committee. In looking over my previous information, I saw that I had recommended the formation of an ad hoc subcommittee of this board called the facilities committee. So I'm going down that line, and this could help with the development of a new Crozet Elementary School in another phase of redistricting or even a possible bond referendum later on during this term of office. The second thing is I did ask about, well, this was way back in August when we had heard of the possibility that we're just getting ready to learn whether if we'd actually gotten it. But in the event that COVID subsides next year, could our division make use of this $5 million ESSER III grant towards the costs of running summer school and camp opportunities, summer learning opportunities, both of which  we're already aware we'll be doing, as well as after-school enrichment activities. We don't know officially that we've received it yet, but that will be a possibility coming sometime soon. My next point has to deal with"
