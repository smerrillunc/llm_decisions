    "comment": "Given all we've discussed tonight about this matter,\nI do feel like it's time for us to move forward with these changes\nand give staff what they're asking for so far as their input goes into how things go at least from here until next year when there may be more information available.\nSo my hope would be if we could get some feedback by December first because then maybe we can make adjustments mid-year instead of waiting till summer again which seems too late given where we were last spring.\nAnd also just want to say thank you very much Dr. Haas for getting back up here today after being gone yesterday afternoon during part of our meeting.\nWe appreciate everything he does every day but especially his willingness to come out even though not feeling great yet still gave an update on COVID numbers.\nThank goodness those continue going down slowly but surely anyway.\nBut yeah, let me know any questions anyone has otherwise unless someone else wants to speak now?\nNo? Okay. So motion made seconded please roll call clerk.\nYes ma'am.\nMs Colson Berger Mr Page Graham Paige Kate Acuff Judy Lee Ellen Osborn John Alcareau Yes Maam Motion passes unanimously six zero.\nOkay moving along number five action item B approval of revised job description assistant superintendent instruction division supervisor curriculum development coordinator instructional technology specialist data analyst teacher mentorship program manager student activities director athletic trainer head coach department chairperson middle school counselor high school guidance counselor library media specialists elementary secondary teachers exceptional children central office administrative assistants maintenance custodial cafeteria bus driver substitute nurse health aide secretary bookkeeper accountant financial aid officer human resources generalist public relations community outreach worker network administrator computer technician help desk technical services engineer system administration server virtualization desktop engineering infrastructure operations security systems integration project management team leader IT customer service representative digital learning innovation strategist chief academic officer executive directors deputy superintendents associate superintendents assistant superintendants superintendent assistant principals principal vice-principal deans students' affairs coordinators career coaches college counselors social workers psychologists speech language pathologists occupational therapists physical therapist adaptive P E instructors interpreters translators nurses registered behavior technicians behavioral analysts mental health professionals substance abuse prevention interventionists family engagement liaison homeless liaisons foster care point person migrant recruiter English learner parent educator gifted talented resource teacher reading math science literacy numeracy arts music drama dance band orchestra chorus strings visual art theater tech stagecraft graphic design film video production photography journalism newspaper broadcasting radio television debate forensics mock trial model UN quiz bowl robotics coding programming app game web page software developer cybersecurity internships work-based training apprentices"
