    "comment": "yes.  OK, thank you, Mr. Page.  If you can please read out the results. OK, I've asked Mr. Gillespie to go through the vote and he said we had eight members voting yes and zero voting no and zero abstaining.\nAnd that's correct. So the motion then passes unanimously.  Great. The question was Mr. DelCaro has moved that we approve our consent agenda for August 12th,\nMs. Lee seconded and by unanimous approval of the board, the motion carries. All right. So now what will happen because of time constraints\nis if Ms. Colson has comments at this meeting, she won't be able to do them. She would usually follow up by email anyway if there is something she wanted to tell us.  Our moment of silence then followed our announcements to our opening item rather than its usual time.\nDo any board members have any comments or concerns for open session? We've done open sessions for two months since January. Since January, Mr. Johnson, who didn't get the opportunity yet and Miss del Cardi, but nobody has mentioned they want anything here. Any public commenters signed up? I'd love to see how Dr. Acula is feeling these days.\nWe still can keep it open if someone shows up within three minutes, but no one has so far registered to speak during the course of our session. This is the time during our session.\nSo Mr. Alcaro made the motion to end the public comment period early because we've got to start our next item. The second is by Ms. DelBurgum.\nIf there's not a second then I make my case just in case that's what Dr. Kaelin has already heard. OKay, the moment I see Mr. P. Cato's name up,\nthen that means I'm finished speaking. And so I'm not quite sure why I kept talking past this point since I did have my last comment of thanks for everyone working at that committee, given their hard work on this matter that will be"
