    "comment": "yes. All right, now that motion passes seven zero. We'll go ahead and see if there's any other business. Are there any announcements? Is Dr. Haas here tonight? Yes, he is. OK. He has an announcement. Dr. Haas. Oh, just thank you all again, and particularly everyone who had to work today at their buildings. I know it was a crazy day in some places, but it was really good to hear from Mr. Crim and Ms. Bell and others about how well things went across the division. So thank you, and please tell everybody else thanks also for us. And then I wanted to announce because I always forget and I apologize if it's too late. But tomorrow morning, Friday at 8:00 AM is actually our teacher appreciation week kick off event at Western Albemarle high school out front circle where we're gonna give away coffee and doughnuts and muffins and recognize our teachers coming into school tomorrow. And that is open to staff, parents, community folks, students, anyone who wants to come by and say thanks to our teachers can stop by starting around 7:30 in the circle at Western. The superintendent does not have anything for the board. Mrs. Carlson does not have anything. Do any board members have anything they'd like to discuss or share since we don't have closed session? If not, I guess we could adjourn tonight's meeting and we won't call you next time until Monday night.  Okay, moved by Ms. Lee seconded by Ms. Colson that we adjourn this evening's meeting of the Albemarle County Public School Board. Is there any further discussion on the motion? If not, Mrs. Johnston? May I please have a roll call?  Elizabeth Perez, chair, Kate Acuff. John O. Alcaro, Judy Lee, Katrina Coulson, Dave Oberg, Ellen Osborne, Graham Page. Motion carried. Have a great weekend, everyone. Thank you. Bye-bye. Goodnight.  Welcome back to the Albemarle County School Board's business meeting for April 21, 2020. We welcome you"
