Well, thank you so much, too. That means a lot coming from me. Is that all right?\nmatthewhaas: No more meeting in October.\njonnoalcaro: Whoa. So I guess next month I won't have to sit at this end. That is correct. Thank you. Thank you very much. It worked out great. I don't want to jinx anything. All right.  Are you doing some type of experiment with a cup or something behind you, Mr. Alcaro? Is that an Alcatraz project"
