    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.1: COVID Mask Policy - The board will discuss the district\u2019s COVID-19 health protocols, specifically whether students should be required to wear masks while in classrooms. This policy would apply during the regular school day, with exceptions for lunch and designated mask-break periods. The goal is to balance student safety with comfort and learning effectiveness.. Who would like to start?"

    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Absolutely, Katrina. Thank you for setting the ground rules. As a concerned parent and educator, I'd like to emphasize that my primary concern is ensuring a safe environment for all students and staff. Given the current COVID-19 case rates and risk assessment, I strongly believe that requiring masks in classrooms is essential to mitigate transmission risks and prioritize student wellbeing."

  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Ellen, thank you for sharing your concerns. Mr. Oberg, you've also submitted an opinion on this matter. Would you care to share your thoughts now? Remember, concise comments are appreciated given time constraints."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thank you, Katrina. I agree with Ellen that prioritizing student wellbeing is crucial. However, I'd like to add that we must consider the impact of mask-wearing on learning and academic performance, particularly for students from vulnerable populations. A balanced approach that weighs both safety and pedagogical efficacy is vital in informing our decision-making process."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "David, I couldn't agree more about striking that delicate balance. As superintendent, I'm keenly aware of the importance of fostering inclusive learning environments where every student feels seen and supported. In addition to considering the data on mask effectiveness and potential impacts on learning, I recommend exploring ways to ensure equitable access to high-quality masks for those who may need them most. How might we leverage partnerships with local organizations or allocate resources to make sure no child falls behind due to inadequate equipment or supplies?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Kate, your emphasis on inclusivity and resource allocation resonates deeply with me. It's critical that we identify innovative solutions to address these disparities. Perhaps we could explore public-private partnerships, collaborate with local non-profits, or even establish a'mask donation' program within our own schools to support families struggling to access quality masks. By doing so, we'll not only promote health but also uphold our commitment to educational equity and fairness."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Excellent suggestions, David! I think those ideas warrant further exploration. Jonno, you had mentioned earlier that you wanted to weigh in on the specific metrics we're using to assess risk levels and guide our masking policies. Can you elaborate on your concerns and how they relate to our broader discussions around student wellbeing and learning outcomes?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Yes, Kate. Thank you. My main concern lies in ensuring our decision-making is informed by reliable data sources and accurate assessments of COVID transmission risks. If we commit to implementing universal masking policies, we must regularly review relevant metrics, such as infection rates among children under 18 and vaccination coverage in our area, to guarantee the strategy remains effective and proportionate to actual risk. We owe it to ourselves and the students to stay vigilant and adjust course accordingly, always keeping at the forefront both short-term and long-term implications on overall well-being and academic achievement."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "That's sage advice, Jonno. Judi, as our nurse leader, could you speak briefly about any recent changes in guidance from county health officials or updates on emerging research regarding mask efficacy, especially as it relates to younger age groups? Are there new considerations we should factor into our deliberations moving forward?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thank you, Kate. Indeed, staying abreast of evolving guidelines and research is crucial. Recently, our county health department reaffirmed its stance on recommending mask-wearing in indoor settings, citing ongoing community transmission and hospitalization rates. Notably, the CDC has emphasized that correctly fitted masks can reduce transmission risks, especially among young children who aren't yet eligible for vaccines. One aspect worth highlighting is the growing body of evidence suggesting that layered mitigation strategies, including mask-wearing, ventilation improvements, and enhanced cleaning protocols, yield better outcomes than single-intervention approaches. Our consideration of mask policies should acknowledge these cumulative benefits and prioritize comprehensive safety measures."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Judy, thank you for that valuable update. Your point about layered mitigation strategies resonates strongly. Graham, would it be possible to summarize key points discussed thus far, particularly concerning balancing safety and learning objectives, and perhaps outline next steps for us to continue refining our approach to masking in classrooms? Additionally, how do folks feel about forming a working group to delve deeper into implementation logistics and potential accommodations?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "I wholeheartedly endorse Kate's suggestion for a summary and next steps, Graham. Before that, I'd like to add one more thought: as we move forward, let's ensure that our decision-making process incorporates diverse perspectives from teachers, students, and families, particularly those from historically underserved communities. Their voices will help inform a more nuanced understanding of our students' needs and facilitate a more targeted response."

    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Good evening, everyone. I am Dr. Graham Page. I really appreciate the very thoughtful conversation. The question for me is just sort of bringing together some of the things that were discussed already. First off, in terms of our analysis right now,  we're looking closely at Albemarle County School System COVID-19 cases per hundred thousand over seven days.  And then you compare that against other local school systems because you know that you are drawing students and faculty from different areas across the city and county. But then again, we've got to take the information that comes out of Virginia Department of Health that deals with the positivity rate here in the Blue Ridge District. But then beyond that too, because we draw kids from neighboring counties and places, we gotta look at their numbers. Right? So you get down to kind of the nitty-gritty and look at that. What was the percent test positive during that last week and then obviously where does the incident of cases stand per hundred thousand? What does it mean when it gets above 200? And as you're talking, when does the recommendation start going towards mask mandates?  When you see something higher than two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, five hundred. Now is it linear after that? No. Does that necessarily mean you've reached herd immunity when you reach sixty-five or seventy?  No, we don't have that information. So the issue becomes how can we best protect those people while still having some form of education. At least a couple times in our history, when there have been problems, we've used remote instruction successfully. We can give parents choices between remote and regular attendance. In fact, there are a few of our students that asked that same question today. To which I said I cannot say yes because we don't know what the future holds. And I wouldn't give false hope, okay. You want the flexibility. We all do. I want it, but I won't give false hope. So we deal with a number of issues related to providing education. Now one thing that you didn't bring up yet that actually came through several meetings prior to yours was that there was great dissatisfaction expressed relative to a shortage of nurses in the school system that we weren't addressing properly and didn't address. Okay. Therein, though, I learned that when we tried to fill positions back during that period of the beginning of COVID, we filled eight vacant nursing slots because you know what happened?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, Graham, for summarizing the key factors influencing our decision-making process. I agree that considering multiple data sources and metrics is essential in informing our approach to mitigating COVID-19 risks. I also appreciate your emphasis on exploring flexible solutions, such as offering remote instruction options, to accommodate varying needs and preferences. Regarding the shortage of nurses, I concur that it's an important issue requiring attention. Perhaps our proposed working group could explore ways to address this gap, potentially collaborating with local healthcare providers or educational institutions to identify creative staffing solutions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "I appreciate that offer, Ellen. And if we wanted to staff them fully, then I think it's $250,000. So the problem isn't necessarily solving the $250,000; it's getting qualified applicants, whether they're part-time, full-time, whatever. As far as the working committee goes, and I'm not sure that it necessarily starts immediately tomorrow night, whenever you call it, you might get recommendations from board members saying \"I recommend X person.\" Or it could come from Dr. McLaughlin if she had her own ideas about whom she thinks would serve well on that particular committee. So yeah, it may be a combination of lots of input. We certainly need to represent the teaching corps, probably administrators within schools since they often have insight. We'll work with the PTOs to find a parent representative. If you put six on a committee that you must consider being available sometimes for online sessions. Then how many hours might each member spend dealing with stuff so you can be prepared for another session in real life? And before concluding tonight, I would appreciate knowing the sentiment around my last question so I'm clear about the charge given to me by the board. My question to the Board is this: Do we wish to proceed in organizing a small working group of representatives from various stakeholders in order to dive deeper into pandemic-related instructional concerns such as accommodating individual student exceptions, brainstorming additional support structures, and weighing mask policy nuances? For example, when exactly to shift toward optional versus mandatory. Am I missing anything else, or maybe you have something specific you would suggest? Should we establish subcommittees beneath the umbrella of that larger team to tackle these tasks separately, reporting regularly back to everybody. That was the essence of my final query posed earlier. Is there agreement to set up such a committee to dig deeply into every aspect mentioned plus anything that comes along? And then once again, when do we meet next month? It is September first, so we usually schedule a meeting early on during the calendar month. So I believe it would be either the second or the ninth.  I guess I am open to doing that. I think it's reasonable to expect that we could do something on Zoom or face-to-face locally. But if there's no difference, the choice belongs to you guys.  Thank you. I appreciate that. All right, goodnight. So I'd ask the vice-chairman to call the roll. Mr. Alcaro. dr"

  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Yes. I appreciate Graham's summary of considerations and Ellen's acknowledgment of the importance of multifaceted thinking. The formation of a working group resonates with me. This collective effort will allow us to delve more profoundly into our pandemic response strategy, taking into account diverse perspectives. I wholeheartedly endorse creating such a committee comprising teachers, administrators, parents, and other relevant stakeholders. This collaborative body will enable us to discuss critical topics like masking policies, accommodations, and remote learning possibilities in depth, ultimately enhancing our ability to ensure both public health safety and quality education for all our students. I propose we move forward with establishing the working group, encouraging its members to examine existing research and data to inform evidence-driven decisions that align with our core values. By pooling our expertise and engaging openly with concerned parties, we'll develop effective strategies for adapting to the evolving landscape of COVID-19 challenges in our district."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "To summarize, it seems there is consensus around forming a working group to investigate aspects related to COVID-19 management, including masks, exceptions, remote learning options, and nurse staffing. I recommend we formalize the group's purpose, membership, and deliverables prior to our next meeting. Furthermore, it's crucial we engage transparently throughout the process, ensuring stakeholder feedback channels are accessible and considered. I propose the working group submit progress updates during future meetings to maintain visibility and facilitate informed decision-making. With this framework established, I am eager to collaborate closely with the working group towards optimizing our district's pandemic response while prioritizing equity, accessibility, and student welfare. Are there any remaining questions or areas of concern regarding this path forward?"

  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "I concur with the suggestions made thus far. Establishing a working group comprised of diverse stakeholders is essential for developing a comprehensive and adaptable COVID-19 response. Incorporating local healthcare professionals, as David suggested, will undoubtedly enrich our understanding of risk assessments and mitigation strategies. Moreover, ensuring representation from underrepresented groups and prioritizing transparency throughout the process are vital components of this initiative. To supplement Kate's proposal, I recommend allocating dedicated time during our next meeting to define the working group's parameters, including their goals, timelines, and communication protocols. This structured approach will guarantee a productive and focused dialogue, ultimately leading to data-driven decisions that benefit our students, staff, and broader community. Are there any further thoughts or refinements to add to this framework before we conclude tonight?"
