    "comment": "yes. Are we ready to proceed? The motion is passed. What do you recommend next, Mrs. Colson?\nkatrinacallsen: That's correct, Mr. Page. And in terms of next steps, they would include, again, this presentation goes to the school board, it's posted for public comment over two weeks through tonight, so please feel free if you're listening to join us live or email any comments at school board or members during that time period. Also, those minutes from the meetings, along with attachments 4A, which includes what we've heard to date, may be accessed on our website. Tonight is another check-in progress report. If we have more changes coming up from the division level, we will discuss them. But hopefully that could even be some of those updates. And then an update, again, including our plan to begin to assign numbers, which we'll talk about more of it in the future and how they're working across our region, also part of tonight's document. But in terms of our next steps, once we hear back from you, what are next steps really involve just continuing with the assignment of indicators into categories and our continued community engagement and input at the end. Again, the goal is this document can go forward as the new framework for our comprehensive plan. All right, with that as information only, questions? Thank you so much for your attention on this item. Next items to be held by consent agenda is an application for special permits SP201500003 to allow Albemarle High School located at Albemarle High School at 2775 hydraulic road in the Samuel Miller district to hold events exceeding the by right density. And to allow a waiver or variance approval for items requiring site plan waiver approvals not listed as eligible in section, the current application materials can be found within attachment 1 of the meeting agenda packet of this evening, including the applicant's submitted materials, county staff reports, and staff recommendations. Ms. Johnston, I guess it has been suggested that we have a motion"
