    "comment": "Are we getting rid of the closed sessions at all? I thought we were doing them after like after open business now instead of having separate ones throughout. That way, you guys get breaks. Well, how many kids do you want in the room from the high schools?\nkateacuff: 12 to 15 people is what we're asking for approval tonight.\nkatrinacallsen: Okay. Sorry, excuse me. My apologies.\nunknownspeaker: I'd prefer three reps each per school, please. Or just an average number that could cover all schools? For example, that would include three members each school district. How does that sound? Because the other question that came up earlier was also about whether we wanted two representatives from each school or four reps in total representing different geographic districts? What kind of rep did you see for geography versus for the school reps? As soon as the committee met back in August, that became clear. In fact, several times during the meeting that afternoon, we said that may change so therefore that might impact where we are tonight. Sure. It changed yesterday too since I've seen last night. Okay. Any additional comments? No. Are there any changes? No. So we are ready to proceed at this point.\ndavidoberg: If I might say something, I apologize for being slow in giving feedback as far as coming off the email. One thing I would encourage you is we could discuss how the members of the board felt about our previous student rep model when we had the virtual meetings. We could give a little more details as far as pros and cons"
