    "comment": "yes.  Okay, thank you. It has passed seven zero, so it will come out now for further action by the county and city. OK. We moved into our closed section, excuse me, sorry about that. Could I get a motion? Mr. Alcaro?\nkatrinacallsen: And can I just say something real quick? That when these motions pass through the committee meetings with the supervisors, if you see their agendas, if you go look up next week's agenda, you'll probably see it there. So even though we've approved this here tonight, until it passes through those committees, it's still going through its process. But I just wanted to remind everyone that since we do not meet again, unless there's another emergency meeting called until March, if everything gets aligned correctly,\nwe should have that check written to ACGS around February 1st, so just FYI. Are there any questions from anybody else? No?  Then I move that we move into a closed meeting according to Virginia State Code Section 2.23711A16 for consultation with legal counsel regarding specific legal matters requiring the provision of legal advice by such counsel and A17 for personnel consideration.\nunknownspeaker: Second.\ndavidoberg: Moved by Mrs. Carlson, seconded by Dr. Acuff, that we go into closed session. Is there any discussion? Hearing none, Ms. Johnston, could you please call roll for the vote? katrinacallsen: Chair Page, Vice-Chair Carlson, Dr. Acuff, Ms. Colson, Ms. Lee, Ms. Osborne, Mr. O'Carroll and myself. All of whom voted affirmatively in open session. The motion carries.  OK, thank you.  Wait, sorry, Graham,"
