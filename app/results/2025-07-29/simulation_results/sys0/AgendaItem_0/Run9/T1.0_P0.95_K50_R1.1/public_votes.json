    "comment": "yes. I now declare by motion carried that the Albemarle County School Board has adopted the proposed policy. This was an action item from last week's agenda, but a poll had not been called when Chair Page made the call on the question. It looks like we might actually be out of business after next Tuesday night. I hope so anyway. In which case, let's move on to announcements. Mr. Alco, do you have any?\nunknownspeaker: Not tonight. Just thank you, guys for all your help. Yes, I just want to add a note about the new year at each school. You're all invited. I look forward to seeing them next Thursday morning. At the school starts. So yeah.\nkateacuff: Okay, great. Well, thanks everyone. And I also would like to say that I am doing some outreach to community members who've reached out expressing interest. And perhaps other board members could join us too if you'd like. But to sit down and listen because there's quite a few people who have concerns about policy D. And then they didn't come here tonight. So I'm going to try to reach back out and see what their thoughts were and continue listening sessions as well.\nkatrinacallsen: I would love to help facilitate one of those because I haven't met with anyone yet. If we can break up the list. Sure.\nkateacuff: We'll divvying it up, OK? Maybe some of the rest of you who don't know me too.\njudyle: There have been some suggestions that we offer some evening times because evenings are difficult.\nkatrinacallsen: Good point. Yeah, because some teachers came during the day, but I got a lot of requests saying can we schedule something after school. For the first two weeks of classes, that may be really tough. But maybe we could do some early ones and late ones just to capture everything.\nelizabethvillarreal: I have expressed interest, and I am available this weekend.\nunknownspeaker: Sounds good. OK, anything else? That's all I had to report. How about old business? Oh, oh, sorry. Are you? Oh, right. It seems he hasn't said this yet"
