If someone comes in, yeah, keep their meeting going. OKay.  All right, so finally, Mrs. Carlson? We all want them to be happy. And I appreciate all that you bring every day. And I hope you remember our words here and our thanks over the year because thank each other constantly. But it's nice when you're on the receiving end sometimes. With no other items for the agenda brought forward for our board, could I ask our chair vice-chair take a moment, please call the closed session. Sure. All the meeting after a poll or motion by Graham Page seconding motion, we need motions. And a second. A second from Judy Lee, roll to see whether they wish to go into our close session.\nkateacuff: Motion carried unanimously and then after a polling of a motion by John O Carro and a second by Dave Oberg. I don't know why the camera won't come across now that we had done one motion on what I'm hearing right now, but if that's correct, then yes, let's take the roll, please. Thank you.\ndavidoberg: Ms. Lee?\nkateacuff: OK. Ms. Osborne?\nellenosborne: Yes.\nkateacuff: Mr. Oberg?\ndavidoberg: I am not seeing Miss O'Carroll"
