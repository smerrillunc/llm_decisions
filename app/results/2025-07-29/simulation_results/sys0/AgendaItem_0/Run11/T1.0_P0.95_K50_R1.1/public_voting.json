Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.1: COVID Mask Policy - The board will discuss the district\u2019s COVID-19 health protocols, specifically whether students should be required to wear masks while in classrooms. This policy would apply during the regular school day, with exceptions for lunch and designated mask-break periods. The goal is to balance student safety with comfort and learning effectiveness.. Who would like to start?"

    "content": "Thank you, Graham. I'd like to initiate discussion by seeking a clear understanding. Can our administration please clarify the current COVID-19 case rates and risk assessment within our schools and community before we consider our masking policy? This information will guide our decision-making process effectively."

    "content": "Our division-level case data reveals that daily new cases are now averaging between 300 and 400 countywide.  At least one school reported 11 known active student cases just last week, which is why, Katrina, it's essential we continue monitoring these numbers to determine potential risks as we forge ahead. Now would you like to share anything regarding Albemarle County Public Health officials' most recent assessment regarding transmissibility? Dave? Do you have an update from them, specifically related to our schools' situation, because their guidance has significantly impacted us thus far? So yes, let us talk further about that. We've been extremely grateful to receive their input at each stage of our reopening effort. And so Dave, please inform us further. So Dr. Haas, if possible, could he weigh in upon our request here? Or anyone else who would care to offer context. Okay, thanks very much. I know Dr. OCarro was also present in this meeting as well last week. So yes, Dr. K. Kate Acuff. You may proceed. OK, thank you very much Kate. All right. There were no questions for Kate other than what Matt's question addressed based upon her information.  In fact it seems that the most important number in these data points would indeed be the percent positivity rate when there isn't a high transmission category anymore. Right, we're operating on data that they provide to help us decide. Thank you very much Kate. All right Dave, so given our data point discussion, then what do you propose going forward with your group here relative to face covering? We look at, again, seven-day new cases per hundred thousand residents in this community. A few more specific things that maybe haven't been shared yet, but the group is now considering an additional metric of twenty-five to thirty five cases per hundred thousand over a fourteen-day period. But we didn't set that one down in writing. With either of those two, a lower percentage of test positives that you can see up there with PCR tests, rapid antigen tests would have to occur along with other metrics being evaluated. Are there any other elements to highlight here based on updated guidance? Yes, Ellen and then John. In particular in some parts of the state, even higher levels have occurred as well. So, how far beyond Albemarle might we find ourselves looking? And Dave had also asked Dr. Garrett about the use of different masks based on the fit, which"

    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "I appreciate the thorough review of the current case rates and risk assessment, Graham and Kate. As we move forward with our decision, I want to emphasize the importance of prioritizing student wellbeing, particularly for our most vulnerable populations. It's crucial we consider not only the physical health implications but also the emotional toll of prolonged mask-wearing on our students. How can we strike a balance between safety and promoting a positive learning environment? Have we explored alternative solutions, such as improving ventilation systems or exploring outdoor learning spaces, to reduce the reliance on masks?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "That's a valuable consideration, David. While we've emphasized mask-wearing, it's essential to evaluate our multi-layered mitigation strategies and identify areas where we can innovate. For instance, investing in air purifiers and upgrading our HVAC systems could enhance indoor air quality, reducing virus spread. Additionally, flexible scheduling options or outdoor instruction could provide breaks from masked learning. These ideas align with our commitment to prioritizing student wellbeing alongside safety. Has anyone examined our budgetary possibilities for infrastructure investments or potential grant opportunities to support these alternatives?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "I'd like to build on David's and Kate's comments by highlighting the need for equity in our considerations. As we weigh the pros and cons of mask-wearing, we must acknowledge that our most vulnerable populations, including students with disabilities and those from low-income backgrounds, may be disproportionately affected by both the virus and the measures we implement. Can we discuss how we plan to address these equity concerns and ensure our policies don't exacerbate existing disparities? Furthermore, have we considered engaging with local community organizations and families to gather their insights on the impact of mask-wearing on student wellbeing and potential alternative solutions?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, Judy, for emphasizing the critical aspect of equity in our decision-making. To address your concern, I suggest we explore ways to provide targeted support for our vulnerable populations, such as providing access to medical-grade masks or offering additional resources for students who may struggle with mask-wearing due to disabilities or anxiety. It's also essential to engage with local community organizations and families to gather feedback and ensure our policies are responsive to their needs. I recommend establishing a task force to focus on equity and inclusivity in our COVID-19 response, ensuring that all voices are heard and valued throughout this process. What are your thoughts on this proposal?"

    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Kate, Ellen, and Judy bring up valuable points. Before we weigh the effectiveness of different masks or invest in ventilation systems, let's take a step back and solidify a clear framework that incorporates the nuances discussed. Our decisions must be guided by evidence and centered around student wellbeing while addressing the equity concerns that Judy mentioned. To facilitate this, I second Ellen's proposal for a task force focused on equity and inclusivity in our pandemic response. Such a body would guarantee diverse perspectives and empower students, staff, and families in shaping our approach. Prioritizing collaboration will help us make informed choices that benefit everyone involved. Could we discuss possible next steps for implementing and staffing such a task force to best serve our students?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Absolutely. I think setting up a task force that's dedicated to evaluating these nuanced aspects ensures that we're taking a comprehensive and inclusive approach towards COVID-related decisions, certainly as we navigate the changing landscape with school reopenings. This task force, once established, could then assess the array of factors touched upon today, including the case rates, and subsequently the policy's ongoing efficacy. I wholeheartedly agree with Ellen and John that this is something worth doing right away, focusing on building a representative team that can guide our efforts moving forward."

Shall we discuss the scope and composition of this task force, including its membership, timeline, and key objectives?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Excellent suggestions, David! To further define the scope and structure of this task force, I propose we assemble a multidisciplinary group comprising representatives from various stakeholders, including administrators, teachers, students, parents, local health experts, and community organization leaders. We should strive for representation across various demographics, including race, ability, socioeconomic status, and geographic location. The task force should aim to meet regularly over the coming weeks to analyze data, consult with experts, and review public input to inform policy recommendations. Their primary objective will be to provide actionable advice for School Board consideration. To enhance transparency, minutes and updates from these meetings will be shared publicly through our district website and at School Board meetings. Is there agreement on these guidelines for the task force? Any suggestions for specific individuals to join this effort?"

    "content": "I appreciate Judy's and Ellen's thoughtful additions to the task force's composition and scope. With these adjustments, I believe we have a robust framework in place. Moving forward, I recommend we ask each School Board member to nominate one to two candidates from our community, who possess relevant expertise, for consideration as task force members. These nominees will undergo a brief application process to ensure they align with our objectives and values. Next week, we can reconvene and collectively review the applications, aiming to finalize task force membership by our following board meeting. In addition to the community representatives, I propose we invite Dr. Maria Rodriguez, our district's Health Services Director, and Ms. Lisa Nguyen, Environmental Sustainability Coordinator, to participate as ex-officio members. They'll provide essential guidance on health metrics, district resources, and sustainable practices. Who has any concerns or suggestions regarding the selection process, task force membership, or our proposed timeline?"

    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I couldn't agree more, John. Offering community information sessions and partnering with local organizations that advocate for underrepresented groups will not only promote awareness but also encourage a stronger pool of applicants. It's crucial that we engage our community in this process and ensure the task force embodies the diversity we're striving to support. Graham, could you please assist us in coordinating these outreach efforts, leveraging your connections with local advocacy groups and arranging informational sessions within the next few weeks? With timely planning, we can ensure these events take place before we close nominations, allowing interested community members to submit their applications confidently."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Absolutely, Kate. I'd be delighted to help orchestrate the community outreach initiatives and collaboration with advocacy groups. Our District Office team can work closely with local organizations, share social media posts, and send targeted emails to raise awareness about the task force among historically marginalized communities. Additionally, by hosting information sessions in multiple locations around the county, we can make it more convenient for residents to learn about the task force and apply if they're interested. My goal is to have all necessary arrangements in place by next Wednesday. That being said, I do want to underscore the importance of keeping our community members updated throughout the entire process, which includes having minutes from task force meetings, summaries, and progress reports readily available to the general public. This transparency is critical in maintaining public confidence in the decisions we make going forward. What are everyone's thoughts on these logistical details? Do we need to add anything else? Do we have consensus on moving ahead with this approach?"

  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I think we've had an excellent discussion and identified several key components for establishing the task force effectively. To confirm our agreements and action items, let me summarize. First, we've settled on the task force's composition, incorporating diverse stakeholders representing varied demographics and fields of expertise. Second, the task force's purpose revolves around informing policy recommendations based on data analysis, expert consultations, and community input, focusing primarily on mask mandates in schools during the ongoing pandemic. Third, the group should convene regularly, share minutes, and offer weekly or biweekly updates on the district website. Fourth, an application process will identify suitable community members, and Board members will be asked to nominate potential members. Finally, Graham will coordinate outreach initiatives, informational sessions, and collaborations with local advocacy organizations.\n\nBefore proceeding, I seek clarification regarding the number of community members and their term duration. Should this task force consist of nine to eleven community representatives, along with school personnel and ex-offico members like Dr. Rodriguez and Ms. Nguyen? Also, what should their tenure look like, considering the dynamic nature of the situation?\n\nMoving forward, once we've finalized the task force roster, would it be useful to discuss their immediate tasks or agenda items, like engaging with local medical professionals, gathering insights from other districts' successful implementation methods, and developing communication channels for collecting public input and disseminating findings to the broader community? Thank you."

  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Excellent summary, Katrina! On the task force size, I concur with your proposal of nine to eleven community representatives. This range allows for diverse perspectives while facilitating productive discussions and decision-making. Considering the fluidity of this pandemic, a reasonable tenure for task force members could be three to six months, allowing them to focus on providing strategic guidance without an excessive time commitment. We should revisit the roster periodically to ensure fresh ideas and adaptability to evolving circumstances. As for their initial agenda items, your suggestions align perfectly with our objectives, Katrina. By involving local experts, learning from peer districts, and establishing efficient communication channels, the task force can quickly make meaningful contributions to our policymaking process.

    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "I echo Ellen's sentiments about incorporating exceptions and accommodations within our mask mandate policies, underscoring our commitment to equity and student-centered decision-making. To facilitate a smooth integration of these factors, I propose that the task force dedicate a subgroup to specifically explore these nuances, guaranteeing adequate consideration of diverse student needs and voices. Furthermore, by soliciting input from various stakeholders, including parents, educators, and relevant medical professionals, the task force will create a more inclusive and compassionate framework for addressing these complexities. We must uphold our responsibility to provide equal opportunities and support systems for all students."

  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thank you, Jonno. It's paramount we balance the need to mitigate risk with supporting students' individual needs, thereby creating an inclusive environment conducive to successful learning outcomes. Incorporating a dedicated subgroup focused on exceptions and accommodations is a sound strategy. Their attention to detail can help minimize negative impacts on already marginalized groups while fostering empathy and cooperation throughout the planning process. David, have any additional thoughts on how this subgroup might function optimally and interface with the main task force? Should they operate separately yet synchronously to streamline collaboration, documentation, and eventual policy formulations? Or perhaps you envision something else?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "An excellent suggestion, Katrina. I agree that establishing a dedicated subgroup on exceptions and accommodations is necessary for a comprehensive approach. In terms of operational structure, I propose that the subgroup functions as an integral part of the main task force, maintaining close synchronization to avoid silos and ensure seamless collaboration. The subgroup could meet concurrently with the main task force, with its members participating in both entities. This dual involvement would allow for ongoing knowledge-sharing, ensuring the subgroup's specific findings and recommendations are incorporated holistically into the task force's work. Regular check-ins and cross-reports between the two entities will maintain transparency and foster cohesive policy development. We'll aim for efficient use of resources, avoiding duplicated effort, while still honoring the complexity of these particular considerations. Thoughts, colleagues? Does this structural setup resonate with you all?"
