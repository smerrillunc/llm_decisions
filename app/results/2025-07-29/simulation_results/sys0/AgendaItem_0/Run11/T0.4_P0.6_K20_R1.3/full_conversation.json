We also had some questions come up around how effective wearing face coverings really were inside those buildings. So let me ask her too please address that question posed by Ms Colson earlier tonight so she may give more information than just simply answering my request but certainly answer yours because they're related topics. Please go ahead. Thanks very much. Good evening again everybody. As always thank you Mr Page and members of the School Board for allowing time to share updates relative to public health data trends locally which continue informing recommendations made through collaborative work between ACPS Central Office staff along with ACPHD partners who support guidance provided across multiple areas including mitigation strategies such as universal indoor masking. Our primary focus remains ensuring safe instructional environments conducive to high-quality teaching practices supporting academic success among division learners. To date, throughout summer months, transmission levels remain low regionally according to CDC metrics though trending upward slightly over past weeks due primarily to Delta variant spread seen nationally. In response, updated guidelines released August third emphasize layered prevention measures proven successful against SARS-CoV-two variants observed thus far. These include vaccination whenever possible; correct consistent use of well-fitting multi-layered facial covering devices indoors regardless of inoculation status unless exempt per VDH Interim Guidance Released July twenty-ninth; physical distancing three feet apart ideally six wherever feasible especially amid higher-risk activities involving increased exhalation forceful expulsion events singing shouting yelling exercising etcetera; staying home post-diagnosis isolation period completion following close contact quarantine duration adherence hand hygiene respiratory etiquette cleaning disinfection ventilation optimization testing diagnostic screening symptom evaluation plus prompt notification tracing cooperation. Since late spring early fall semester planning stages began June eleventh, county cases rose gradually peaking mid-July then plateauing until recently experiencing slight uptick attributed largely delta-driven surges nationwide. At present, percent positivity rate stands near five point one down significantly compared to winter surge peak above thirty-one percent January eighth. Hospitalization census counts dropped below ten admissions daily average after reaching nearly two hundred fifty patients hospitalized simultaneously back December thirtieth. Local hospital capacity currently sits comfortably under seventy-five occupancy percentage threshold prompting cautionary reopening steps taken cautiously balancing competing interests safely delivering instruction commensurate educational programming opportunities available pre-pandemic times. Now turning toward K-through-twelve operational readiness matters given ongoing pandemic circumstances surrounding evolving situation necessitating adjustments"
