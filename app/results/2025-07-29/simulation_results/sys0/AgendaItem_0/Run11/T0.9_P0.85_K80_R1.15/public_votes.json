    "comment": "So after careful consideration, I'm going to go with the majority. And the motion passes. The motion carried, so this change goes into effect immediately. All right, moving right along. It looks like we've reached the end of new business items. We'll move on to other items. Do any board members have any announcements? Yes, Dr. Acuff.  Okay, actually, Matt. Go ahead. You're muted again. Could I ask if he could unmute Mr. Haas? Sorry about that.  Good evening. I just wanted to let everyone know that the parent advisory committee has had some meetings since last month's meeting and they would be bringing their input from all those sessions back to us at our next meeting, which would be November the first, if everything stays according to schedule. That would give them an opportunity to discuss what was gleaned during those five community sessions around gifted services and provide feedback to the board. Great. Thanks, thanks, Mr. Has, for letting us know about that.  Mr. Alcaro.  Thanks, Chair Page. Just want to remind everyone that October is Down Syndrome Awareness Month and Autism Alliance will have its annual walk on October 23rd at 10 AM at Washington Park in Charlottesville. Also, the City School Board meeting will take place on Thursday night instead of Wednesday due to Yom Kippur observance. And then finally, there will be a regional town hall meeting held by Delegate Hudson on Saturday, October 30th at Monticello High School from 9 until 11 AM. She would appreciate any constituent participation. So please come out. Finally, Happy National Principals' Month. I'd like to thank each and every principal for your dedication and leadership to ACPS students and staff throughout the year. This includes Dr. McLaughlin, Principal Gaffney, Principal Carlson, Dr. Hearn, Principal Ford, Dr. Dearing, Dr. Oliver, Principal Carter, Principal Herring, Principal Wiedow, Principal Thompson, Dr. Malmeng, Mrs. Brown, Mr. Colsan, and Dr. Vivas. Each day, principals and assistant principals work tirelessly to make sure our schools are safe, welcoming places where students can grow academically and socially. And while we celebrate their contributions during National Principals' Month, I hope we remember to show appreciation for all they do throughout the entire year. Thank you very much. Thank you,"
