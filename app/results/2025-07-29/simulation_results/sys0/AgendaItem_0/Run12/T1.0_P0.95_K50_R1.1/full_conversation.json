    "content": "Absolutely, Ms. Carlson. Our team has been working very closely with the local Health Department. Dr. Haas?\ndanhaas: Good evening, School Board. So, at least through yesterday, in the last seven days, there've been 62 positive cases reported in the school division. However, a few of those are actually school system employees who haven't been around kids, so I believe the number of transmission cases within buildings is lower than that. Of that number, most were already out due to some kind of illness or close contact before they became positive.  But if you recall when schools started, we got really aggressive in asking the state Department of Education to let us move back toward normal conditions because things had improved over here. It was only two and a half weeks ago that there were three kids that tested positive in one class, right after Labor Day, at Brownsville. When the principal asked the health department that week what we needed to do based on the situation she described, she basically said you need to go back to where we were.  And Dr. Keaney agreed with her that that was probably the best approach given how fast it spread through that building. From now forward, our strategy is going to shift slightly. We're doing these mass isolation notices more frequently instead. Since 2019-2020, we went away from contact tracing because of the vaccination rate in the community being good enough that just didn't seem prudent. Our position still is that the safest place for kids is in school. With masking, distancing, cleaning, disinfecting as much as possible. The other safety strategies the CDC puts up on their list can stay as optional to families until we hit levels like we saw in January earlier this year.  So I don't have any specific information on hospitalizations this morning, but as far as deaths goes, this chart tells me that there were a dozen new hospitalizations between the ages of five to 17 last night, so 12 since October 8th. And it's just sort of like we've seen since August. Right after school opens up every year, you see respiratory viral season spike.\ngrahampaige: Okay. Thank you. That provides important context. Ms. Osborne or Vice Chair Carlson. Do you wish to pose your question concerning this portion of the presentation, or shall I give Dr. O'Carroll a chance to share his information to round out section B before delving deeper into the"

    "content": "Indeed, Kate, the evidence highlights the crucial role mask-wearing plays in mitigating virus transmission in educational settings. Studies consistently demonstrate a significant reduction in SARS-CoV-2 transmission within schools where mask mandates are enforced, particularly when combined with social distancing, hand hygiene, and ventilation measures. What I'd also emphasize is the equity aspect; vulnerable populations, such as immunocompromised children, disproportionately benefit from universal mask-wearing policies. In fact, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends masking for all individuals above the age of 2 years in school settings. By understanding the scientific foundation supporting mask efficacy, we can thoughtfully weigh its implementation against concerns around learning effectiveness and student wellbeing. If we may continue to Section C, I'd appreciate the opportunity to delve into the specifics of its impact on student learning experiences."

    "content": "Absolutely, Jon. Thank you for sharing the scientific underpinnings of mask-wearing's effectiveness. That equity consideration is especially critical, ensuring we prioritize our most vulnerable students. Regarding Section C, I'd like to explore further the nuances of mask-wearing on learning experiences. How do we account for potential drawbacks, such as difficulty reading nonverbal cues or feelings of discomfort, while still reaping the benefits of reduced transmission? What strategies can we employ to mitigate any negative impacts, particularly for English language learners, students with hearing impairments, or those relying heavily on facial expressions for social cues? Can we look into ways to incorporate teacher training and support, as well as accommodations for students who face unique challenges with mask-wearing?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Indeed, Kate. These considerations underscore the importance of acknowledging both the benefits and limitations of mask-wearing in the classroom. To address these concerns, our teaching staff could engage in professional development opportunities focused on adapting instructional methods, promoting clear communication, and leveraging alternative non-verbal cues. For instance, teachers might utilize visual aids, written instructions, and increased body language awareness. Additionally, implementing accommodations like transparent masks, which facilitate lip-reading, or providing mask breaks in safe environments for students struggling with mask-wearing could prove beneficial. Furthermore, fostering empathy and emotional intelligence by discussing the importance of mask-wearing as a communal responsibility could enhance students' comfort with the practice. It is crucial to involve our teaching staff in the solution-finding process to ensure effective, student-centered approaches. Ellen, do you have thoughts on strategies to engage our educators in developing best practices for masking in classrooms?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thank you, Jon. Establishing an inclusive student advisory committee requires careful consideration of diverse representation and accessibility. To ensure broad input, I propose a hybrid model that incorporates both school-level representatives and targeted focus groups addressing specific student populations. This blended approach could consist of a core student advisory committee composed of one representative per school, selected via a nomination or application process, to ensure proportional representation across the district. Supplementing this core committee, we would also establish specialized focus groups tailored to address issues relevant to English language learners, students with disabilities, and other historically underrepresented student groups. Through these targeted discussions, we'll gain a rich understanding of the unique challenges and barriers faced by various student demographics, enabling us to craft solutions that effectively meet the wide array of needs within our student population. By combining these two elements, our student advisory committee will be well-equipped to advise us on the implementation and continued refinement of our mask-wearing policies in a way that caters to every student's needs. Katea, I'd love to hear your input on the feasibility of implementing such a hybrid structure. How might we ensure adequate communication and coordination between the school-level representatives and focused advisory groups?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I appreciate Katrina's suggestion for a hybrid model, allowing us to capture both general student sentiments and specific concerns of underrepresented populations. Implementing this structure would indeed require strategic communication channels and efficient coordination. One possible strategy involves holding regular check-in meetings where school-level representatives can convene with members from targeted focus groups. Additionally, designating specific facilitators for the student advisory committee and focus groups can aid in keeping them connected while tracking progress, raising questions, and providing updates on ongoing work. This facilitation could occur through email forums, digital tools, and shared documentation sites, making sure that no one misses out on important information and that every voice gets heard."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thank you, Katea, for outlining potential communication pathways. That sounds very feasible. As we proceed with designing our hybrid model, let's also consider ways to engage broader school communities, beyond just the appointed representatives. We want every student to feel invested in the process and empowered to contribute. We should plan to announce opportunities for involvement, host public informational sessions, and maintain transparency regarding meeting dates and agendas. Furthermore, creating an online portal where students can anonymously provide comments or ask questions will widen the net for gathering valuable input. What do others think about setting aside dedicated time slots during school days when students can access virtual office hours or discussion rooms for direct input and discussion with committee members? That way, we're removing barriers and offering multiple avenues for participation. David, any thoughts on whether this hybrid committee will need additional support staff? Do we already possess enough resources to facilitate this endeavor effectively?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Excellent suggestions, Katrina! Ensuring broad engagement and accessibility is crucial. Concerning resources, I believe we can adapt existing support staff roles to facilitate the hybrid committee, at least initially. Our administrative assistants, school counselors, and even teacher leaders can play key roles in organizing meetings, facilitating communication, and overseeing documentation. However, we must acknowledge that this may eventually require additional funding allocations to guarantee sustainability. We'll need to assess our budget and potentially allocate funds from future budgets to maintain the committee's momentum. Nonetheless, considering the benefits of amplifying student voices, it's a worthwhile investment in our students' well-being and academic success."

  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "That's a great point, Judi, about accommodating different learning styles and schedules. Offering varying formats and timing options will help ensure that all students have a chance to participate. I'd like to suggest that we also consider recording these sessions, with proper consent, of course, so that students who cannot attend can still review and provide feedback asynchronously. This way, we can truly capture the diversity of perspectives and experiences within our student body. Ellen, what are your thoughts on how to effectively promote these town hall sessions and other engagement opportunities to our students?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Absolutely, David. Promoting these opportunities effectively is crucial to ensure widespread awareness and participation. I recommend utilizing a multi-channel approach, including social media, school announcements, posters, and direct outreach to student organizations and clubs. We should also enlist the help of our student ambassadors and school leaders to spread the word and generate buzz around these events. Additionally, we could create engaging promotional materials, such as eye-catching flyers or videos, to grab students' attention and convey the importance of their input. By doing so, we'll create a sense of ownership and agency among our students, encouraging them to take an active role in shaping our mask-wearing policies. Graham, how do you think we can balance promoting these events with avoiding information overload, especially given the numerous initiatives and announcements students already receive?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Ah, wonderful question, Ellen. Indeed, striking the right balance is crucial here. To avoid overwhelming students and maximize visibility, perhaps we could integrate promotion of our town hall sessions into existing communication channels that students regularly engage with. For instance, include it in morning announcements, the county's weekly student newsletter, or even our mobile app. Furthermore, let's make sure school administrators and teachers actively promote these opportunities in class and school-wide assemblies. And importantly, ensuring student participants receive recognition and incentives, not only boosts morale but encourages more peers to join in. What's critical is that we tie these initiatives to overarching goals centered on care for each other and fostering a sense of unity across our schools. If done correctly, our efforts should demonstrate clear value-adds for students while strengthening relationships with our schools overall. How does everyone else see us best integrating this initiative into daily life, leveraging current channels, and rewarding student contributions effectively?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thanks, Graham, that's a thoughtful response. As we incorporate this new policy, we should remember to highlight its alignment with our district's core values and explicitly communicate this to both students and families. Transparency is vital, especially with potential concerns about safety and equity implications. Throughout these implementation stages, I suggest scheduling regular check-ins between committee members, stakeholders, and families to provide updates and gather continuous feedback. Moreover, conducting anonymous surveys and monitoring student feedback through focus groups or roundtable discussions will be instrumental in refining our approach based on emerging insights and issues that arise during implementation. Does anyone agree that biweekly committee meetings would provide a solid foundation for tracking progress and addressing student concerns, while allowing for needed adjustments throughout this transition period? And finally, as Judi mentioned earlier, incorporating input from local organizations may offer valuable insights and support in reaching underserved populations and enhancing our overall initiative's effectiveness. Jon, could you elaborate on why involving local organizations might prove particularly beneficial here?"
