This is in front of our committee of the whole and any other new business items.  Then at our last meeting of February, we're going to go through these things more completely. All right now, moving on, our next thing is our reports. Okay, Mr. Page.\nkatrinacallsen: I'd just like to say congratulations again to everyone who got their second vaccination dose yesterday. And I appreciate the emails that several people sent saying how nice the facility was set up.  It was very organized. They were prepared with the necessary precautions, masks, et cetera, and made an easy process. So thank you to those people who helped out. And good luck with the clinic today.\nunknownspeaker: Yeah, thank you. That sounds great.  I did get my second shot yesterday.

And I don't know what we would do without the two way communication that that allows us to share the story with our community. And we did hear how positive people were when they were leaving. The smiles and the relief, I think is palpable among the 1,500 folks who've had shots so far. Great collaboration, you guys.\nellenosborne: I'll third it. Everything went off so smoothly and was so efficient. I mean, it was quite impressive. Thanks to the team that worked on it and our nurses, health professionals.\ndavidoberg: I would also like to offer a kudos to those. One was a nurse from UVA that actually lived in Charlottesville who volunteered her time. She said she's usually dealing with patients who come to her. And instead, she wanted to deal with students who were getting shots. And then someone gave me"
