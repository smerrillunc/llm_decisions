    "comment": "Yes. Thank you very much. We're now closed. Any other business?  This meeting of the Albemarle School Board is adjourned. See y'all tomorrow morning. Good night.\nkatrinacallsen: It is adjourned.  Well, I guess we did not close. Sorry about that. There was a motion made. Is there a second?  No, OK. Motion failed. If someone wants to make another motion for some type of motion, such as moving the first reading forward to the first day of the next month. Or something along those lines. But that's not what we voted down just then. That was simply closing or approving tonight. So if you want to make that, I'd let me hear that now. Or we may proceed. Is there any other business?  Okay. Meeting adjourned.  Thank you. Thanks everybody. The time is 9:28. So I think this might be an all-time record for a January meeting, which always seems to be a bit longer than normal anyway. But thank you all. And see you bright and early in the morning for our annual organizational session and our regular monthly sessions coming up immediately afterward. Stay safe out there driving home. Thanks. Bye-bye. 7pm is when we reconvene. Yeah. What would the notice period have to be? For public hearing?\nkateacuff: You'd have to give two weeks' written notice. A couple more quick announcements. At seven o'clock, we do have a consent agenda. Please remember we have some materials online regarding COVID numbers, some staff updates that went through email and were posted last week. So please review them prior to that meeting. So anything else? Thank"
