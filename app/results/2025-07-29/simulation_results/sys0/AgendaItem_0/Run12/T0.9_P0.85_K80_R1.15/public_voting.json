    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thank you, Graham. I'd like to open by reiterating that our top priority remains student well-being, both physical and emotional. Can we have a quick review of current case rates in the county before moving into our analysis of the mask-wearing requirement? We must base our decision-making on data-driven facts and risk assessments. Ellen, can you provide an update from Public Health Services regarding transmission levels among children aged five through twelve in recent weeks? What does the current trajectory indicate about potential surges post-reopening? How do those findings influence your guidance for mask mandates?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, Katrina. According to the latest report from Public Health Services, our county is currently experiencing a moderate level of community transmission, with a positivity rate of 7% among children aged 5-12 over the past two weeks. While there has been a slight uptick in cases recently, the overall trend suggests a plateauing effect. However, it's essential to note that schools reopening may lead to increased transmission, especially considering the highly contagious nature of the Delta variant. Given these factors, my recommendation is to maintain a cautious approach, including a mask mandate, at least until we see a consistent decline in case numbers and hospitalizations."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thank you, Ellen, for providing us with the most up-to-date information. It's crucial we make informed decisions based on reliable data. In light of this moderate transmission level, I believe it's prudent to explore the effectiveness of mask-wearing in reducing the spread within our schools.
