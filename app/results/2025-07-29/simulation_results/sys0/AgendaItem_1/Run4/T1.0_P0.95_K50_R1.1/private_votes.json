    "comment": "yes. Now recording votes. And so Matt, why don't you start, please? Mr. Alcoke, please enter yes for him. Ms. Lee, Mrs. Osborne?  All right, Dr. Acuff, Ms. Carlson, Ms. Colson, Mr. Oberg? Dr. Acooppe? All right, and then Ms. Acuff again? I guess? OK, looks like we got everyone. OK. OK, I did this wrong. The motion passes eight zero. The motion carries unanimously. Thank you. And congratulations to our staff for the excellent presentation. I hope I'm not stepping out of bounds here, but this does sound like really fantastic stuff. And, I know all you people don't get to hear all of our things. But our staff has just gotten better every single year, it seems like every month we always talk about all the good things you guys do for kids. But I know you had some big time help on this, especially at Jack Jewel. You all brought the principal in, Mr. McCall was in charge of everything and then you had 12 people there, too. So that was impressive. And, we appreciate all that extra effort. I see what happens in meetings when staff brings visitors in and how excited they are. And you bring them back out there and say, hey, let's give another round of applause. All of our staff deserves it, though. I mean, y'all deserve rounds of applause. Thank you.  And I guess finally, John, just before we close, John, do you have anything else? No, actually, no.  Is that going to make it into the minutes if you go back and look at them? Oh, that will be a little awkward, I apologize.  Well, congratulations, guys. Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for watching tonight. Meeting adjourned. Thank you. Goodnight. Bye. It is now time for a five minute break before we have closed session. Let us reconvene in five minutes.\nkatrinakellert: Okay, we've now concluded that portion"
