    "comment": "Yes, moved approval for adoption of minutes. Ms. Osborne has moved, do you really move and Mrs. Osborne? She has. Do you not see her? Kate Acuff seconded the motion, but she could give up that spot if it appears you want it more strongly and I've already had to tell Mrs. Cawthron that she doesn't get to make the second until the first one disappears. But Ms. Lee seconds that motion by Ms. John. Right, right, yeah. The chair thanks Delegator Laura.\nkatrinacasave: We are just kidding around today.\nunknownspeaker: Yeah. That is exactly what we are. OK. All right. Moving right along then, is there any discussion on our minutes prior to a motion. Any discussion or any changes made from the minutes as they were presented?  OK. All right, that question does not count because you weren't recognized. You have done what I have asked of people. If you would like to speak, raise your hand, I'll let you and that means wait patiently sometimes, like I always do at a meeting. If there is nothing else that you folks who spoke would like to say. Okay, if there is nothing else in your minds, you wish to comment or change before a motion passes, then a voice vote may be called. And all those in favor of approving the minutes please say \"aye.\"\nellenosborne: Aye\nkatrinacallsen: Aye\nmelaniedoberman: Ayne\ndavidoberg: eye\nkateacuff: Aye.\nunknownspeaker: Eye.  All"
