    "comment": "The motion passes unanimously at seven zero. Mr. Page, could you please read us into closed session again if there isn't any other business coming out of here? OK, thank you very much. We're ready then to move back down to close sessions. It is moved by Mrs. Lee, seconded by Miss Colson, that the Albemarle County School Board goes immediately into executive session because they were not able to get their meeting started earlier today due to technical difficulties. They had some issues getting Zoom up running properly. But anyway, we can certainly accommodate them since we got through everything else quickly enough. Is there any further debate on the motion? If not, Ms. Johnston, could you take roll once more, please?. All those who wish to enter into the closed session, which has already passed, but just want me to make sure everyone knows how each person voted, including myself, may indicate such by saying \"aye\" when called upon. As soon as everybody says Aye, I won't even wait anymore. Are we good? Okay, thanks. Thanks, Dave. Goodnight. Bye-bye. Oh sorry, Graham, did you still have something left over? No sir. You didn't miss anything except maybe a little bit of confusion around whether he wanted to put off until next week or whatever. He said he'd rather come back another time than try to rush things too fast. That sounds great. Well, let him know that we appreciate him taking care of himself first. Absolutely. Yeah. Take care, guys. Have fun tomorrow night. See y'all later. Bye bye. Hello? Anybody still there? Hi! Sorry about that. Can someone hear me okay? Yep. Great. Just checking. I guess we lost two people during closing motions. Anyway, welcome back to open session. This evening, April 8th, 2021. Welcome back to the regular meeting of the Albermarle County Public Schools' Board Meeting for Thursday, April fourth twenty-first. Tonight's agenda includes several action items"
