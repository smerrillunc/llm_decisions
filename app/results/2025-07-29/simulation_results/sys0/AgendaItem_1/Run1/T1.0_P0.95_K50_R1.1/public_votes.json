    "comment": "yes. Now let me look up into this particular item now to ensure its adoption. The motion passed 7/0. The next order of business under action is approval of the minutes from our April meeting.  Mr. Oberg, can you present that? Is this motion seconded? Moved by Dr. Acuff. Second by Mr. Alcaro. Mrs. Schmidt? We had one correction. Are there any others? Ms. Lee, do you want to put in the correction also? Please go ahead. Thank you for helping us get that correct information, both of them. All right, is the motion moved? OK. I'm sorry. Did we not move it yet? Okay. It's moved by Mr. Acuff, second by Mr. Alcaro. Moved by Mr. Acuff, second by Mr. Alcaro, who moved that the minutes of the April 14th regular session be approved as amended. Discussion on the motion? Hearing none, Ms. Johnston, would you call the roll please? Dr. Acuff? Yes. Mr. Alcaro? Yes. Miss Osborne? Yes. Mr. Page? Yes. Ms. Lee? Yes.  Mr. Oberg? Yes. Miss Colson? Yes. Motion carried. Thank you. So all right, if everyone stays just a minute for just a second, I'll give you another chance.  Are there any comments of appreciation that need to be acknowledged? If so, we'd like to know those too. Any announcements that the board members may have since you've got your opportunity now, including new announcements that have popped up during the last month and any old reminders. You can't remind anybody of anything. We haven't seen most of them in three weeks, two-and-a-half. I know you're going to take care when doing that. And they will give everybody else a break too because they might see people they don't know very much either other than being outside on their porch waving at somebody walking by.  Ms. Delcaro, you wanted to make sure there was something mentioned tonight about our county school bus drivers. You might just repeat what we were"
