    "comment": "Yes. It seems like there was some confusion about who voted when, but Mr. Alcaro, did I hear you say, I'm not sure if I heard him correctly. You said no?\njonnoalcaro: No, I just said yes again because everyone else had a chance to explain why they were saying their answer, so yeah, that's okay. Go ahead and continue with everything.\nunknownspeaker: Okay, thanks. All right, motion passed unanimously. We have moved onto the closed session portion of our agenda. And so, Ms. Colson, could you please read us into a closed meeting?  Let me pull up the motion real quick. Here's a motion based on the Virginia Freedom of Information Act Section 20/02.1 dash two, as stated by Superintendent Haas and his deputy counsel, Alison Blakely. I move that the Albemarle County School Board go into a closed meeting as authorized by the Virginia Freedom of Information Act section 20/01 dash one slash 20 dash 02 point zero one, which allows for meetings to interview an employee candidate. But let me get back on track. Sorry about that mistake. Our school division superintendent for the advisory interviews held to discuss appointment, assignment, promotion, demotion discipline dismissal evaluation, licenses, relief of the whole principal. And also subsection three, discussion, consideration acquisition of real property for public purpose and business investment excluding proprietary records but including nomination of appointees competition and examination grades and scholastic records confidential letters staff resignations since they're personnel matters that can only be discussed in a closed session. I move that as soon as possible now that we certified by recorded roll call, voting Dr. Acuff, Chair Page, Vice Chair Carlson, Ms. Lee, Ms. Osborne, Mr. O'Carroll, Mr. Alcaro and myself, Dr. Kate Ackley that we'll move immediately into our closed session. Any other motions or seconds or anything like that needed at this time?\ndavidobergmanesq.: Graham, would you make that formal motion?\nkatrinacallsen: Yeah, actually, what he wants you to do is move that after the certification by roll"
