So that means we have six people voting \"yes\". Our motion carries. Are there any comments for tonight's closed session?\nmatthewhaas: Mr. Page, could you call the roll again so everybody knows whether they've actually voted or not because some of them didn't see the comment in the chat.\njonnoalcaro: Sorry, my apologies.
