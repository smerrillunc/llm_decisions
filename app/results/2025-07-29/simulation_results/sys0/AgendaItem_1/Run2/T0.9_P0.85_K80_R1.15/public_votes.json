    "comment": "Second. OK, moved by Dr. Acuff, seconded by Mr. Alcaro that we approve GBFC-R1 as written. Is there any further discussion? It can be approved if so. If not, Mrs. Johnston, could you please give us a roll call on the vote? All right. Ms. Colson? Yes. Dr. Acuff? Yes. Ms. Lee? Yes. Ms. Osborn? Yes. Mr. O'Carro? Yes. Chair Page? Yes. Motion carried. All right, thank you very much. Are there other motions or is there anything else coming out of closed session that we would need to act on?\nkateacuff: Point of order.  We actually didn't do two different policies in this particular thing. One was JFAF. The other was GBJD. Could someone explain why we only heard from Ms. Johnson on both policies when she read them? That means Ms. Carlson did not speak about these motions when they were introduced, which caused some confusion on my part.\nkatrinacallsen: Yeah, I apologize for that. I'll make sure to clarify going forward, but since these were just changes due to code updates and they're typically ones where there isn't a lot of debate around those types of policy changes, I usually try to group similar type of items together when possible. But again, I should've done a better job clarifying that for you, particularly given there were two different policies. So I apologize for that and hope going forward it won't cause any additional confusion. Dr. Acoff, did you want me to bring back the two separate policy readings to clarify them later, then we might decide if any actions needed to happen based off of Ms. Acuff's comments? Or do you want me to look into that?\nkateacuff: I appreciate that. No, go ahead. There may be another solution than having her reread everything, but you know, it was pretty confusing to hear one person reading two completely different things"
