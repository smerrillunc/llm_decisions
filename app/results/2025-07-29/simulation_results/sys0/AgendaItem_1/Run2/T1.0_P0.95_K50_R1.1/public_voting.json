Thank you again, Katrina and David, for proffering these valuable considerations. Kate, Ellen, might you also share thoughts on the importance of balancing infrastructure and programming needs going forward?\njonnoalcaro: Good morning, everybody. I just wanted to say good morning to my board members. I understand there was much said yesterday morning and last week. Just going back in line and reading the comments that were made this morning, it seemed like we're going to take this to another phase and really get down into what we want to see in the schools. And then you'll come back to the board again. But so far, the money that was talked about had to do with the schools. What I didn't hear was what we are going to do about the CATEC. We've got, right now, one hundred-plus students that need air conditioning. They're the only students in the county who do not have air conditioning. If we're going to talk about equity in the system, it seems we should probably start off with something we already know about instead of doing a lot of fancy things first. I totally agree with the gentleman from Broadus Wood that we need to see a list of the people that are involved in the building because they always say it's going to rain sometime but the water doesn"
