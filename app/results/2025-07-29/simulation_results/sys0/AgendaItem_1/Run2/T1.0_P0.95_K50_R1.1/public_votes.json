    "comment": "yes. The motion carried unanimously. Is there anything else for items of business? Are there any other motions? Are there any other requests from the public or the podiums? There were two different motions, and both passed.  Yes, correct. OK, so thank you, Dr. Auerbach. Thank you for taking us through the steps of these policies. This has been quite an evening and for what happened before this part of the meeting.  All right, then, if there is nothing else, we will adjourn this meeting. You heard the vice chairman's call for adjourning our February 4th meeting of the Albemarle County Public School Board into our closed session, which followed the end of tonight's meeting before this, before it started tonight. So our next regular meeting will take place here on March 10th. It will follow a four p.m. work session where we're having several work sessions scheduled throughout the remainder of this semester.  So until we meet again on the 10th, I would say good night and give us thanks to our entire staff who was involved with the meeting and putting out our communications today and so forth. Thank you, Mr. Yes. Chair Page, I just wanted to ask if we had some opportunity to recognize Black History Month coming up starting next week in some way. I'll look forward to that. Just a small statement and a small resolution recognizing it. Thank you"
