    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.2: High School Renovation Project - The board will consider approval of funding for major facility improvements at the high school, including building four new science laboratories and repairing the athletic fields. The science lab construction is projected to cost $1,240,400 spread over four years, while athletic field repairs are included in the same package. These upgrades aim to improve STEM instruction and student access to safe extracurricular facilities.. Who would like to start?"

    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thank you, Mr. Paige. I'd like to inquire about budgetary implications beyond the stated costs. Are we looking into grants, community partnerships, or potential fundraising opportunities to supplement the allocated funds? Additionally, have we identified key performance indicators to assess the project's success, particularly regarding its impact on student learning outcomes?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "That is a great inquiry. We absolutely should explore alternative revenue sources such as local foundations that focus on education as well as STEM-based interests. If there's opportunity for us to leverage state monies also through grants or if we can tap into larger statewide funding mechanisms. And certainly philanthropic interests too if they may be able to help support our efforts there. And with respect to KPIs, yes, that would be crucial in assessing whether the investment that we make really has significant impact for those teachers who deliver instruction within the space and ultimately how the instructional spaces are being utilized by teachers. So that is something that definitely we would need for any capital improvement that we undertake. It is essential because without measuring results from that, we wouldn't know necessarily that the results match what our expectations are going in. But I believe we've talked before about our SMART goals, strategic goals. I'm sure that you've seen them. Our strategic plan has five tenets and they revolve around academics, climate, workforce, relationships, family and community engagement, and safety and wellness. What we want to see if these investments do anything positively with respect to metrics tied to each one. They were already created.  They're being applied to all decisions made here for educational advancement.  All that gets done is that our strategic objectives have been developed with some lagging measures. This year, for instance, will develop two leading targets for every one of our goals. It takes three years. So that by next year though, we'd expect more of that data than we had to inform decision-making when our plans become mature enough. For any number of purposes. Anytime people come up to request money, it is something our staff should give considerable thought to in their requests because they have that to guide us towards the very best use of financial resources that exist for both this particular situation with that item you got but other items as well and just making use of other things outside of this request that staff might bring forward to fund. Any response, Ms. Schmidt? We actually just gave you the green light on your dashboard. Could you now proceed to update us with the status or where you are with updating that so that we could be further apprised, please? Do either gentlemen want to respond based upon any component of this question? Do any of my other board colleagues? We seem to think we must evaluate it not simply by saying I hope people learn better, but what instruments are they taking advantage of that"
