    "comment": "yes. Does everybody see the total? OK. The result is 7-0. Okay, the motion has passed unanimously. We've concluded agenda item 3.2. Well done, colleagues! There's always room for growth and continuous development; but this crucial milestone shows our unwavering support for the educational excellence our children deserve. Mrs. Acuff, it goes without saying that our deepest gratitude extends to you for meticulously presenting and guiding us through these comprehensive updates alongside the district staff. Keep leading the charge toward realizing such remarkable enhancements that promise enriching experiences and brighter futures for Albemarle County Public Schools' high school students!  OK, let's go on to our last report by Miss Johnson-Cusick. Are there any more announcements or comments coming out of the board, Ms. Johnston-Cusicks? Do any other board members have anything else they would like to say prior to entering closed session? Is there any particular element within this consent agenda needing to be pulled or debated separately, either right now or immediately after we return from our private executive session?  Because it doesn't seem there are any items requiring separate consideration, may I request that someone kindly introduce a motion asking the chair to adopt all remaining Consent Agenda Items 4.1 through 4.5 together with Action Item 10.1. Is there a second on the offered motion? Any discussion? I will call for votes in a moment. If each of you could enter your votes for the group action item inside the Zoom chat box area now, I shall tabulate the outcome of our electronic polling system shortly. Wait a minute. All right. Here we go again. Please indicate one time using yes, no, or abstain to register your individual consensus on adopting said items, respectively numbered 4.1 to 4.5 inclusive as part of the combined consent agenda along with action item number 10.1. The only responses required at this stage are simply your respective votes since thorough explanations for the entire range of topics encompassed by these agenda items already exist within minutes or handouts distributed beforehand for your review. Simply type one"
