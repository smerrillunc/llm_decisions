    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.2: High School Renovation Project - The board will consider approval of funding for major facility improvements at the high school, including building four new science laboratories and repairing the athletic fields. The science lab construction is projected to cost $1,240,400 spread over four years, while athletic field repairs are included in the same package. These upgrades aim to improve STEM instruction and student access to safe extracurricular facilities.. Who would like to start?"

    "content": "Thank you, Mr. Paige. I appreciate your succinct introduction. In order to frame our discussion today, can we first clarify that both parts of this project \u2013 the construction of new labs and athletic field renovations \u2013 were identified as priorities through previous community input sessions?"

  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Yes, Ms. Carlson. That\u2019s correct. And I want to emphasize how grateful I am for the invaluable feedback provided by so many stakeholders during those listening sessions and surveys. It truly shaped the vision behind these critical improvements, which align with what our diverse communities see as most essential. We now have a rare opportunity here where both projects will be tackled simultaneously, streamlining costs, improving learning environments, and creating better experiences for students across various disciplines. Could someone summarize the current state of STEM resources currently available within our schools? Kate Acuff? Please enlighten us about some specific examples."

    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Kate, thank you for preparing to share that information. Before you do, might I add that it's crucial we acknowledge the disproportionate impact outdated STEM resources may have on historically underrepresented student groups? As we discuss these upgrades, let's keep equity at the forefront, ensuring our investments benefit all students, particularly those who've been underserved in the past. Now, please, Kate, proceed with your summary. What's the current landscape of STEM resources look like in our schools?"

    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "David, I couldn't agree more about prioritizing equity throughout this process. Currently, our STEM classrooms and laboratories lack modern equipment, adequate space, and safety features, hindering effective teaching and learning. Specifically, some labs don't meet contemporary science standards, and our teachers often have limited flexibility when designing engaging lessons due to infrastructure constraints. Moreover, we notice significant disparities between schools, exacerbating existing achievement gaps among our student populations. By approving this proposal, we'll take a vital step towards providing equitable opportunities for every student to excel in STEM subjects and prepare them for an increasingly complex world."

    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Kate, thank you for painting such a vivid picture of our current challenges. Your points underscore why these renovations are long overdue. Graham, could you provide insight into the phasing and timeline for these projects? How do you envision the construction process unfolding, considering the potential disruptions to classes and extracurricular activities?"

  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Absolutely, Dr. Oberg. I'm glad you asked about the timeline because careful planning is crucial in minimizing any potential disturbances. To that end, our plan proposes dividing the work into multiple phases spanning approximately three years, starting next summer. For instance, the new science laboratory project would likely occur from June 2023 until May 2026. This schedule should allow each phase to take place primarily during non-academic periods, thereby reducing classroom displacement or other operational disruptions during regular academic semesters. Additionally, we're working closely with district officials, architects, engineers, and contractors to develop a detailed project calendar once approved. We must balance swift progress against responsible management of the site logistics and ensuring smooth operations at both the high school campus and alternative sites accommodating relocated programs if needed. Are there additional concerns regarding project oversight, accountability, and keeping stakeholders informed along the way? Would anyone care to elaborate upon that aspect further before moving forward? Jon Alcaro? Dave? Ellen Osborne? Katrina? Judy Lee? Anybody else have something they'd like to contribute right now or ask questions about? It seems appropriate that our chief operating officer share her thoughts at this point to help solidify the administration's commitment to stakeholder engagement throughout this capital improvement initiative. Ms. Lee, I believe it was requested earlier that she explain aspects related to stakeholder communication, collaboration, plus tracking performance indicators tied to the successful execution of our STEM renovation strategy. Would you also remind the board members of their upcoming roles in championing local public awareness of these efforts? Thank you very much for summarizing these important components. We appreciate your dedication and clarity when explaining the administrative elements in our strategic plan. Is there anything you'd like me to reiterate for purposes of full understanding, Ms. Lee? Or do you think that covers everything well enough to move ahead tonight, board members? Have you heard enough?  It appears to me from my perspective based on everyone's insightful comments that we indeed have sufficient information available to make a decision. If not, tell me otherwise. Are you prepared then to hear Ms. Johnston's motion and seconded motion formally presented just now officially recommending adoption? Is everybody set on doing that right away, or are there perhaps one or two last-minute things that you'd like me to cover for any possible clarification, board members? Ms. Colson, welcome back again. Are you ready to bring forth your formal resolution? All right. You have received the revised document electronically. So,"
