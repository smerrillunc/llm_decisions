    "comment": "That might work best.\ndavidoberg: Absolutely. Yeah, sure thing. Kate was there too, so she can help kind of guide through that process if you'd like. But again, so it says here that this group had met multiple times throughout March, really starting about three weeks after the start of COVID shutdowns. They worked collaboratively across multiple groups, including student reps, teachers' council, parent reps, and staff administrators. It was an inclusive effort looking forward to provide those safety guidelines. What I'm gonna give you tonight, so it may look familiar because of what's posted online already, but these were some key findings they wanted to make note of. As they went through their discussions, number one was that every single person on each level could be impacted by any change made during the pandemic response period. One way we looked at trying to address that inclusivity piece was actually having students included on this committee, which has never happened in ACPS history to date where they've been part of such a core working committee. And they contributed heavily with a lot of excellent suggestions on ways to maintain social distancing while still allowing for collaboration among peer groups in high schoolers when you're going to class changes or lunch periods. Teachers also got involved pretty extensively. Their concern early on was simply wanting to make sure that they could protect themselves and family members who maybe didn't live within their household from transmission risks. Staff also voiced concerns related to transportation impacts. One good idea from them was why don't we use shuttle buses to transport kids within neighborhoods instead of needing them to walk longer distances because you know the school sites have changed over time as far as development around them goes. All right, so the two questions for consideration. Number one, should Albemarle County Public Schools reopen"
