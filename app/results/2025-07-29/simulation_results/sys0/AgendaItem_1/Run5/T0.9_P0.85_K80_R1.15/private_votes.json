    "comment": "My vote was yes.  Mr. Oberg? davidoberg: Mine was yes too. Ms. Lee? katrinacallsen:  Also yes. Dr. Acuff? kateacuff:  And my vote was yes. Ms. Osborne? ellenosborne:  My vote was yes. Mr. Alcaro? jonnoalcaro:  Same here; mine was yes. Ms. Carlson? jenniferjohnston:  I voted yes too. Mr. Page? grahampaige:  And finally, my vote was yes as well. OK, then it looks like our vote is unanimous, nine-zero to approve funding for those two projects. And again, we really appreciate  It did go through quickly because we had the input that we got last week, but still very much appreciated the public comment tonight, which actually ran quite smoothly and was much shorter than expected. So thank you to everybody who participated, whether it was written comment or spoken comment, especially given the fact that people couldn't get here tonight due to the weather. Okay, that takes care of everything except announcing that we will now enter closed session according to Virginia State Code Section 2.23711A19, talking to the superintendent concerning the assignment, appointment promotion, performance, demotion salaries discipline or resignation of specific public officers appointees or employees of any public body. Motioned by Mrs. Johnston, seconded by Ms. Colson, we are out of our open session. Thank you.  Second. Is there any discussion? Well, hearing none, Mrs. Johnson? Yes. Roll-call vote, Ms. Johnston, yes, Mr. Alcaro, yes, Miss Coulson Osborn, yes, Ms. Del Caro, yes, Ms. Calsun, yes, Mr. Obergh, yes, Ms. Lee, yes, Mr. Page, yes, and Mr. Page, I mean, Dr. Acuff, yes. All right, the motion passes.  We are going back into closed session. We will see you all later. Bye. Hello, hello, sorry. Just a couple things since I am sitting here, don't forget that we have our retreat Saturday morning at Albemarle High School starting at eight o'clock. Please try to arrive around seven-thirty so we can get started promptly at eight. Then"
