    "comment": "Vote is yes. The motion carries. So all three readings passed unanimously  We'll now entertain motions to adopt an alternative approach with consideration for two weeks with possible revision by staff. For those that we didn't take any action upon tonight, they will come back to us in November.  Is there a motion? I'm sorry, Ellen moved it. And seconded by Ms. Lee? All right. Would you like to speak in favor of this? Ms. Lee? Okay, hearing none and seeing none. Moved by Ms. Lee. Seconded by Mr. Alcaro. That the alternative process for approving policy revisions shall be approved at this meeting with all policies being proposed coming in front of board for information purposes only. Any future changes would only require one reading and board approval to take effect. And further that the board authorizes the division superintendent to revise these policies and other applicable ACs within his purview after they've been published for review and public comment with such changes subject to one additional reading and board approval prior to the adoption and implementation. Is there any further discussion? If not, Miss Johnston, call the roll again. Is there a second? We did get through that motion already. OK. The motion has been seconded by Ms. Colson. Mrs. Carlson. Yes. Dr. Acuff? Yes. Ms. Doberg? Yes. Mr. O'Carroll? Yes. Ms. Osborne? Yes. Mr. Page? Yes. Motion carried. We still need our roll call vote on that because of two weeks prior to the next school board meeting. OK. Miss, can you ask us to please place our vote on the motion on the screen as well please so that we're giving more transparency? Sorry about that. You know, we've made it all right because the motion was done before I could put anything on the slide. Ms. Osborne? Yes. Mr. Alcarro? Yes. Ms. Lee? Yes. Ms. Colson? Yes. Ms. Cale? Yes. Dr. Acuff. Yes. Ms. Dobrah. Yes.  OK. Motion carries. Oh, wait. I'm supposed to do something in addition because he has me do that when we do roll calls. This does it. Thanks. Well, we might try that out next time to see how that goes. I'd say this whole thing went pretty smoothly. I thought it did too. I know we kind"
