    "comment": "And after considering all comments from this evening's meeting with Dr. Acuff present here tonight, along with his staff who has worked diligently through these last several weeks to bring us up-to-date information about what we're doing at ACPS, particularly since March when COVID started impacting everything across America,\nI'm very proud of how Albemarle County Public Schools responded during those times by providing meals out into communities where they were needed most. We've also provided childcare services throughout\nthe summer months while parents had work obligations but didn't know if their children would return back safely because there was so much uncertainty around whether students could come back together again within classrooms without having any further spread of disease. So thank goodness now today we can say that every student does indeed get an opportunity to learn virtually online each day even though some may not want them yet still learning remotely until such time that things become safer enough once more down the road hopefully soon too! But just like other localities surrounding Charlottesville City School Board decided recently voted against going virtual only initially then changed course later due largely thanks partly because many families expressed concerns over safety issues involved especially given rising case numbers locally which made everyone feel uneasy understandably worried sick honestly speaking personally myself included!\nSo let me tell you something else really important thing happening inside public meetings lately; people keep saying why don\u2019t teachers teach live classes? Well guess what folks?! They do already actually! In fact almost half currently offer synchronous sessions daily using Zoom technology allowing kids stay connected real-time interactively engaging lessons taught directly straight away instead waiting till next morning watching recorded videos alone home feeling disconnected socially isolated missing friends seeing peers' faces smiling hearing laughter sharing funny moments bonding forming friendships growing closer stronger bonds than ever imagined possible otherwise truly amazing stuff taking place behind scenes quietly working hard tirelessly keeping spirits lifted high despite challenges faced head-on courageously standing strong united fighting spirit shining brighter never giving hope lost staying positive moving forward always onward upward higher striving excellence pushing limits reaching new heights soaring greater beyond expectations exceeding goals set forth boldly stepping ahead fearlessly embracing change adapting quickly seizing opportunities arising turning obstacles turned upside-down finding silver linings brightening dark clouds spreading love kindness compassion empathy understanding unity harmony peace respect tolerance acceptance inclusivity diversity celebrating differences honoring individuality respecting autonomy promoting freedom encouraging creativity fostering imagination nurturing growth developing talents cultivating skills building character shaping futures molding leaders inspiring greatness igniting passions sparking curiosity fueling dreams driving innovation propelling progress accelerating advancements revolutionizing teaching redefining schooling reinventing norms challenging status quo questioning assumptions breaking"
