    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.1: COVID Mask Policy - The board will discuss the district\u2019s COVID-19 health protocols, specifically whether students should be required to wear masks while in classrooms. This policy would apply during the regular school day, with exceptions for lunch and designated mask-break periods. The goal is to balance student safety with comfort and learning effectiveness.. Who would like to start?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thank you, Mr. Page. Maybe we can start with a couple of my questions. So what criteria are we using to decide when it's necessary for the mask mandate to be put back in place? Do we consider local case numbers or hospitalization rates? And further along those lines, how would it work logistically? I believe Dr. Haas mentioned that in previous policy implementation. It was difficult when administrators were doing checks instead of teachers who already have so much responsibility. How has that improved since last year?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Yes, Ms. Carlson. Thanks. Dr. McLaughlin or Dr. Haas, could you enlighten us with information regarding our current criteria in reinstating a mask-wearing policy? And would our tracking still involve county-specific data and/or hospital capacity figures? And indeed, could you clarify any adjustments made to the enforcement logistics since last year?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "If I may, Graham, add to Katrina's excellent points... perhaps we could hear from our school principals and educators directly. Have there been instances where they felt hampered by the mask policy or, conversely, witnessed its benefits firsthand? As advisors, they can provide crucial insight into balancing the dual goals of safety and educational effectiveness. Did anyone speak to them, gather input prior to this meeting?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Absolutely, David. Yeah. That makes sense. Are our principals prepared to offer remarks about their experiences related to COVID-related policies and mask mandates or possibly share teacher feedback? Any comments, please?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Might I just add, Graham, before we get into specifics, has any updated research been conducted on the impact of masks within classroom settings, given new variants or changes in local transmission dynamics? Ensuring the most recent scientific evidence guides these decisions seems imperative to me."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Oh, good point, Kate. Good thinking. All right, Dr. McLaughlin, did our health committee consult with Dr. Costello to identify updated findings in masking studies? Or possibly ACHD to review and inform our possible future steps? Could you touch base on that aspect?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Excuse me, Graham. Can I piggyback off Kate's request? I'd love to hear about any updates on the scientific side. Also, I'm curious, have we considered consulting with local healthcare professionals \u2013 maybe even those working directly with children \u2013 to gain a better understanding of the evolving situation and their recommendations? They likely have valuable insights we shouldn't overlook."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Absolutely, Judy, that's a great suggestion, yeah, about involving medical experts working closely with minors. Has Dr. Haas actually reached out to those groups for any consultation or advice since we've had our initial meeting? Also, could we set a date for our next update, considering changing circumstances and having them weigh in then?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, Graham. I appreciate the thoughtful questions and concerns raised so far. Building on David's point, I'd like to ask our principals: Have you observed any differences in student behavior or attitudes towards mask-wearing between last year and now? For instance, have students become more accustomed to wearing masks or shown greater resistance? This could help inform our decision-making process."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Thank you, Ellen. That's a great question. I would follow up to Dr. McLaughlin or Dr. Haas - could we actually explore alternative metrics as opposed to relying solely on county case numbers, which are indeed dropping rapidly but may not reflect classroom risks accurately? Perhaps taking into account additional indicators like absentee rates, positivity percentages among students and staff, along with anecdotal reports from our schools on classroom environments, as well as considering all available sources of expert guidance in determining when mask mandates should be put in place. Would it be realistic to revisit mask breaks for kids, especially elementary schoolers, outside when conditions allow or during gym class, enabling both increased airflow and exercise opportunities?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "If I might jump in after John \u2013 I wanted to circle back around David Oberg's excellent idea: speaking to the principals. In light of Graham Paige's request earlier for clarity, could we briefly hear from them now, seeing as they're here in attendance? I know several hands went up when he asked initially."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Ah, Katrina, perfect timing. Graham, if I may suggest, why don't we invite our principals to share their thoughts now? We've had several great questions, and hearing directly from them will provide vital context for our decision-making process. Dr. Haas or Dr. McLaughlin, would you please facilitate that discussion? We want to ensure their valuable insights aren't lost in the midst of our conversation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Just to echo David, yes, please let's give our school leaders an opportunity to share their experiences, and if needed, clarify any operational challenges and areas that need additional support. Additionally, Graham, when setting our next meeting date, would it be wise to invite local healthcare experts to contribute to our discussion, thus gaining invaluable insights specific to our local situation and potentially paving the way for effective adjustments moving forward?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Okay, um-hmm, thank you, Kate, and everyone else. So what we'll do then is give Dr. Haas and our administrators the opportunity to bring forth responses from our building administrators with respect to some things discussed today. You heard Ms. Carlson pose a query regarding whether we'd thought about going beyond simply just looking at countywide cases; Dr. McLaughlin has indicated, I think, she would certainly work on identifying other potential measures. Now, Dr. McLaughlin, did you, uh, manage to speak with principals so that we could hear briefly any comments they have on either masks or distancing or their general observations concerning safety protocols? And perhaps also whether some students, based upon your interactions or discussions, seem particularly affected by mask mandates."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thank you, Graham. Before we move forward, may I request that our administrators also share any concerns or issues they've encountered regarding mask enforcement and compliance, especially considering the varying age groups and maturity levels within our student body? Understanding the practical implications will help us make informed decisions that balance safety with feasibility."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Right. Sure thing, Judy. That was a great point too, you know, getting administrative perspectives is quite critical here. Are there some particular enforcement situations we haven't quite effectively addressed yet, Dr. Haas, that we should keep in mind moving ahead when implementing policies related to student mask use? Some of our younger students, obviously, face certain difficulties adhering to this requirement throughout the entire day, and perhaps this will shed light on potential alternatives we haven't considered previously that could serve to support our students. Any instances where you found exceptional practices in use within the system or possibly alternative solutions already being utilized somewhere?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, Graham, and to our administrators for their input. Following up on Judy's concern, I'd like to ask: Have we seen any correlation between mask enforcement and behavioral incidents in classrooms, particularly among younger students who might struggle with compliance? Understanding these dynamics will help us develop more effective strategies for promoting both safety and social-emotional well-being."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Great, thank you, Ellen. Another aspect worth exploring, as part of the enforcement strategy, would be for principals to look into implementing positive reinforcement, recognizing students that consistently exhibit good mask-wearing habits. Not only does this foster a sense of responsibility, but also encourages peer-to-peer modeling of safe behaviors. Could we get some input from Dr. Haas or our administrators on how we can incorporate incentives to promote the right actions without inadvertently creating unnecessary competition among students, instead focusing on promoting unity in following safety protocols throughout our schools?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Jon, that's interesting. I am intrigued by your concept, Jon, because our discussions lately have leaned heavily on punitive measures. It could be refreshing to flip that narrative slightly. Dr. Haas, in terms of implementation strategies going forward, can you perhaps walk me through how you imagine incentivizing positive behavior around mask-wearing might function logistically? Maybe offer some potential examples in practice? I'm very curious about this shift in perspective and how it could play out in our daily operations."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Yeah, okay, sure thing, Katy. Thanks, Katrina. Yeah, sure, Dr. Haas. Please feel free to add examples related to successful strategies for encouragement or reinforcement of students wearing masks, maybe something to encourage teamwork and unity rather than making comparisons. And I also would like a summary, given these factors, just to make it real clear of any, you know, recommendations as far as changes go. But I guess another thing, do we get data, though? Like if students who may really be struggling for reasons that were alluded to, or that Ms. Carlson mentioned - you know, the possibility of offering more breaks outside or providing extra exercise and airtime? To answer your question directly, Katy, do we have any current system in place or tracking method that monitors this information closely, so we can actually track student progress with respect to this matter?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I really appreciate that last remark, Graham. Perhaps there's room to discuss tracking the effectiveness of both punitive actions and new strategies, which I believe we've kind of touched on today already, but still require further research. It's crucial for understanding the impact our initiatives are having on students across various age ranges. Dr. McLaughlin mentioned reaching out to our directors of health services for guidance and analysis earlier. For our consideration of incentives as well as penalties, I think that data collection could really help shape our subsequent choices as a board. So, if anyone could elaborate on those points specifically, I'd find it incredibly informative for our policy-making decisions moving forward. In this whole scenario, we mustn't overlook the importance of having metrics set aside just for understanding student wellness in conjunction with safety efforts. As Graham said, we do hope to strike the right balance while addressing the opportunity gap, since many families continue to depend on our assistance amid this difficult time."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Okay, I think that makes perfect sense. That way, we'd sort of cover all bases so to speak. Do we really have the capacity to, uh, put forward a recommendation that we formally charge one of our committees with overseeing mask-related tasks moving forward - such as tracking and providing input on, for instance, mask use incentives and enforcement policies as time passes? I'd prefer establishing a specific group responsible for staying on top of these issues going forward, thus allowing for more thorough assessments of various approaches tried. Then it appears that when we discuss metrics, you're asking for data points, in essence. Are there any thoughts? Or could we build off that idea, considering we know that Dr. Acuff spoke briefly about our metrics team during an update. Would that sound plausible to you all?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I just want to reiterate that tracking the effectiveness of both incentive-based strategies and penalty-based measures will be crucial for guiding our decision-making processes. If we move forward with establishing a committee for oversight, they'll need to collaborate closely with our metrics team to collect relevant data, helping us gauge student responses across different age groups and maturity levels."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Kate, I completely agree with you. Establishing a dedicated committee to oversee mask-related tasks seems like a sensible approach. It would provide a focused effort in assessing and refining our policies, as well as facilitating collaboration with our metrics team for data-driven decision-making. Considering Dr. Acuff's mention of our metrics team, it sounds like a feasible path forward. Has anyone thought about potentially including representatives from our schools' administration and teaching staff within this committee to ensure diverse perspectives and firsthand experience? Additionally, what kind of timeline would be realistic for this committee to present its initial findings and recommendations?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "David, I concur that incorporating representatives from our schools' administration and teaching staff would undoubtedly bring valuable insights to the table. This collective input would allow the committee to consider multiple viewpoints and better inform our decisions moving forward. Concerning timelines, I suggest aiming for an initial review and feedback period of approximately six weeks, followed by bi-monthly progress updates. This would give us sufficient time to gather meaningful data and analyze trends while continuously monitoring student wellbeing and adjusting our strategies accordingly."
  },

    "speaker": "grahampaige",
