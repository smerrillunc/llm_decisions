    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.1: COVID Mask Policy - The board will discuss the district\u2019s COVID-19 health protocols, specifically whether students should be required to wear masks while in classrooms. This policy would apply during the regular school day, with exceptions for lunch and designated mask-break periods. The goal is to balance student safety with comfort and learning effectiveness.. Who would like to start?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thank you, Graham. So before we dive in, I just want to clarify for the benefit of those listening virtually that it'd be really helpful if speakers could mention which agenda item we're on for easier navigation of tonight's discussion. Also, I did notice that the updated report was shared at four pm today; I'm not sure everyone got the chance to review it. Just wanted to make sure everybody has had a look or has seen the changes made since last week. Has everyone gotten to that point now?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thanks, Katrina. Appreciate that reminder, yeah. On that note, I did get a chance to review the updated report. For my two cents, I think it's crucial we prioritize student safety right now. Considering the current case rates, don't you think mandating masks indoors would help mitigate the risk? Before we jump into it, though, are there any specific numbers or metrics we can point to that show mask-wearing actually contributes to lowering transmission rates in a classroom setting?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "David, I appreciate your thoughts on prioritizing safety. If I might add, Dr. Rachel Walcott mentioned in her presentation last month that studies suggest wearing masks in school settings reduced COVID transmission by 37%. She even cited the University of Virginia's study on transmission within K-12 settings, showing mask mandates lowered cases significantly compared to schools without them. I completely agree we need to weigh risks against the importance of keeping kids comfortable and engaged."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Kate, thank you so much for bringing that up. That 37% reduction statistic does carry weight. And I remember Dr. Walcott's presentation, too \u2013 very informative. In light of that evidence, maybe we should consider implementing mask mandates for classrooms, at least until case rates decrease further. What do others think about striking a balance between safety and comfort here? Maybe, Jon, you could speak to how enforcing mask-wearing might work logistically, considering our staffing constraints?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "David, I appreciate your willingness to explore both sides. I'm concerned about the long-term impact of masking on our students' wellbeing, but we can't ignore the data Kate shared. Before we decide, can we discuss the possible accommodations for students who might struggle with prolonged mask-wearing, such as those with respiratory conditions or anxiety? Have we explored any alternative solutions that wouldn't compromise safety, yet still support these students?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, Judy. I totally understand your concern for students who might need special consideration. As we weigh the pros and cons, let's also think about the emotional toll of COVID-19 on our students and staff. Can someone remind me what measures we currently have in place to support mental health services in our schools? Are there any plans to increase counseling availability or provide additional resources for students struggling with pandemic-related stress? And, Katrina, regarding the updated report, were there any significant changes made since last week's draft that we should be aware of?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Thanks, Ellen. You raise an excellent point about our support systems. Graham, I wanted to ask, considering the concerns around mask enforcement, could we possibly reallocate some of our existing personnel, maybe repurpose administrative staff, to assist with supervising and reminding students about mask usage? Perhaps we could task our SROs or school administrators to conduct regular checks rather than placing extra burdens on teachers. How feasible might that be, especially given our current staffing limitations? Could somebody walk me through the potential logistics?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "OK, quite a bit discussed already. Yeah, thank you to everybody. Now, just to reiterate again, Katrina raised the important issue of getting clarification on agenda items. So, just so folks know, we are on number three, one right now: COVID mask policy. And we really do appreciate our staff's efforts, working hard behind the scenes to provide the updates to that report. Really, thank you so much. Now, in looking over the comments that we've heard so far, clearly we've been covering a range of concerns. Ellen touched upon mental health services, Judy brought up exceptions, and certainly David Oberg talked about prioritizing student safety and the 37% figure from UVa that Kate referenced. With that in mind, do we need to talk further about our risk assessment levels in order to determine whether or not moving forward with mandatory masks inside makes sense? Ellen, could you update us on where we stand relative to that sort of analysis going forward, based on our current case numbers?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, Graham. Yes, clarifying our risk assessment is essential to making an informed decision. Based on our current case numbers, I believe we're still hovering around moderate risk levels. Although our local health department hasn't raised any red flags yet, I think it's prudent to consider taking proactive measures. Perhaps we could discuss implementing a tiered system, where mask mandates would kick in once we reach a certain threshold of cases per capita. Would that be something our administration could explore further, and perhaps present options for our next meeting? Additionally, David, your suggestion about striking a balance between safety and comfort resonates with me. Could we explore hybrid approaches, like allowing mask breaks during outdoor activities or designating mask-free zones, to alleviate some of the discomfort concerns?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I think that was a great question from Ellen. Yeah, what we are doing and when would we start. Because the way we did before doesn't have to be the way we always do it. Just something to think about. But David, just on your idea of mandating masks indoors right away \u2013 while you acknowledge it's about finding that balance, aren't you essentially saying the same thing we said earlier? A lot of things you'd want to implement, especially after hearing Judy's concerns, would require more support. There needs to be resources allocated and thought put into this, which we didn't exactly accomplish when we rolled out remote learning initially. So I guess \u2013 sorry \u2013 I'll try to shorten it, Graham. The quick way of putting it: Shouldn't we slow down and look for ways to make accommodations rather than jumping straight to full-blown mandates without being able to ensure proper support structures are set up to accompany them?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "OK, I am going to jump in for a second just because I want to say first, thank you so much for all the thoughts that have been expressed. But my thought process right now, again echoing what many of you have said: Do we need to take a little more time to assess where we are relative to those metrics, and then have a thorough discussion of different scenarios, thinking along Ellen's line about a tiered approach that could provide a range of possibilities based upon where the actual metrics lie? And we have done that historically as well. So I guess my biggest question right now to Ms. Osborne would be, what exactly would that kind of timeline look like and exactly how would we use the metrics to drive that decision? So with regards to timing, would it be possible to present our situation to the superintendent \u2013 could Mr. Haas give guidance \u2013 by Friday morning with all of the considerations being made in alignment with the state recommendations, for instance, or whatever else is deemed necessary for us to have the best outcome? Then, considering the feedback we receive, it seems like a reasonable amount of lead time to make any needed adjustments to policies prior to implementation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Excuse me, Graham. I agree with your point on assessing our situation and exploring various scenarios. In fact, our tiered approach could help mitigate the pressure on our educators. Speaking of which, have we considered surveying teachers on their comfort level with enforcing mask mandates, especially since Jonno mentioned reallocating administrative staff? That would give us valuable insights into the feasibility of such strategies. Also, Katrina raises a valid concern about resource allocation; perhaps we should invite our finance team to join us at the next meeting to discuss budget implications for potential support structures. By Friday, could we request data on the projected costs of implementing alternative strategies, Graham?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Yes, thank you. Great suggestions. Absolutely. So, Ms. Smith, Kate, would it be possible to get teacher feedback via survey by maybe early next week, in conjunction with, I guess, Dr. Haas trying to provide some other information along the lines of what Dave suggested? And also, Kate Acuff, would it be possible to have some financial analyses available for us by our next meeting? Are either or both of those requests reasonable?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I apologize, Graham. Before we dive into the logistics, may I clarify? Wouldn't we want to re-evaluate our counselor-to-student ratios to accommodate potentially increased counseling demands amidst the pandemic? Focusing on student well-being will be pivotal in the face of these unprecedented challenges."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Yes. That absolutely makes perfect sense. I really love that, too. Yeah. That does seem to dovetail perfectly with the kinds of conversations that we've had around supporting social-emotional wellness, anyway. To answer, Dr. Acuff, yes, please add that consideration to the mix as part of the analysis. And let me turn this over to you again, Ms. Osborne. Could Ms. Smith incorporate those parameters by the following Monday to allow for sufficient teacher feedback as well, assuming we could hear back by our next meeting?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thank you, Graham. I just wanted to follow up on Ellen's suggestion about the tiered system. Have we explored consulting with local healthcare professionals to inform our decision-making process? Maybe even having them present at our next meeting to provide expert advice on our proposed approaches? It would be invaluable to get their input on what constitutes \"high-risk\" and how we can effectively respond. Additionally, regarding David's comment on surveying teachers, I completely agree. Our educators' voices are crucial in shaping our policy decisions, especially when it comes to enforcement and feasibility."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, Judy. I think that's a wonderful idea, consulting with local healthcare experts. We should definitely consider inviting them to our next meeting. And I appreciate your support for surveying teachers, David. Their input is vital in understanding the practicalities of implementing these measures. Graham, would it be possible to extend the invitation to the healthcare professionals by our next meeting, and could we also request that they provide some guidance on the metrics we should be monitoring to determine when to move between tiers?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Right. Okay. You've added three things there, and I think they're all excellent ideas. But, Dr. Carroll, can Ms. Smith please take care of getting the health professionals invited to our next meeting, with special emphasis on the tiered system, and actually addressing the exact points that were made? And also include their guidance on determining when to move between levels."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Can I add a quick note to that, Graham? If it's okay? Just building off of Judy and Ellen's comments about healthcare expertise: Are we considering including folks with the Health Department in those discussions? Or have we already reached out to them about the evolving landscape and potential risk assessments? And would it also be beneficial to have a liaison from the Health Department join our advisory committee moving forward?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Okay, thank you. Are either of those doable by Friday, Dr. Haas, and/or Mr. Collins? Both getting the health officials to our meeting and also appointing a liaison to join the advisory committee? So, two parts to that request. Could we see movement on either by next week? And Mr. Alcaro, was your question addressed? Did either Dr. Haas or Mr. Collins respond sufficiently?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Graham, I'd like to circle back on what Graham mentioned \u2013 specifically, the opportunity for us to have public comments. I really appreciate Graham saying he values student voices. I believe they can help inform our decision-making processes. With respect to the tiered system, I'd also want to know more about what student input looks like and whether this has been discussed among teachers and administrators. Do we have data backing up student opinions on this specific matter? Graham, perhaps you could elaborate on incorporating student thoughts while devising the tiered system, and then what metrics will indicate whether we shift between different levels? That brings me to my final thought. How will we define what qualifies as'success'? By that, I mean when will we start to revisit these restrictions if our chosen strategy pans out?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Okay. Katrina, there are several questions here that you've brought forth, many revolving around student input. Dr. McLaughlin is going to provide insight into all the work being done right now with our student advisory committee relative to a tiered structure. Ms. Smith can talk about her initial meetings with some student organizations. It sounds good to me. Do either of you want to offer a brief response or update on that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "If I could jump in briefly, Graham? My concern is about teacher input on the actual feasibility of certain measures. In our discussions about mask-wearing and tiered systems, we've focused primarily on health concerns. However, I'd like to emphasize that our educators will ultimately be responsible for enforcing these guidelines daily. Have we considered gathering feedback not just on what measures they think will be most effective but also which ones they realistically feel they can implement, given current resources and staffing constraints? Could we maybe frame those survey questions in such a way that they elicit both perspectives?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Absolutely. Okay, another point added to the agenda, right there. So you would like Dr. McLaughlin to include both of those aspects \u2013 effectiveness as well as practicality or feasibility, incorporating both of those aspects of teacher feedback in the survey."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Yes, exactly. As Graham said, we need to consider multiple facets of any particular approach, not just feasibility but also effectiveness. Teachers' experience would be valuable in identifying challenges or potential pitfalls we haven't considered yet. Could we clarify the deadline for receiving that feedback from educators, Dr. McLaughlin, in time for our next meeting so that we can analyze and discuss results thoroughly before refining any policies further?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Ok, that's enough, we will now vote privately.  We are voting on Agenda Item No. 3.1: Should the district require students to wear masks in classrooms during the school day?.  If each of you could please record your vote in the chat, I will tally them up and announce the results."
