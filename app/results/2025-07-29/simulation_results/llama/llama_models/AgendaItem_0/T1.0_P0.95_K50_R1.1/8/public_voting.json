    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.1: COVID Mask Policy - The board will discuss the district\u2019s COVID-19 health protocols, specifically whether students should be required to wear masks while in classrooms. This policy would apply during the regular school day, with exceptions for lunch and designated mask-break periods. The goal is to balance student safety with comfort and learning effectiveness.. Who would like to start?"

  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thank you, Graham. Before I dive in, I wanted to acknowledge Ellen's request to provide more information. I saw that we got the slides right before this meeting. Ellen, did you want to discuss that first? And just to let everyone know, when we have public comment, I just got alerted it didn't work out properly, so we're looking to extend public comments because there were definitely folks who signed up. So maybe we can do that later in the meeting instead. Sorry for the confusion. But I wanted to jumpstart us with some specific questions around our COVID case rates. How did these numbers influence this discussion today? And what kind of metrics are we using moving forward for tracking transmission rates within our schools? It's critical to me since it seems our local cases haven't significantly dropped recently. So could we discuss our current risk assessment based on those latest case counts?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Katrincarelsen, I apologize, but before we jump into the specifics, I was hoping we could clarify how we'll measure the effectiveness of mask-wearing in our schools. Would it be based solely on case rates or are there other factors we should consider? And I'm not sure I agree that our local case counts haven't significantly dropped; I believe I saw a slight decline last week. Could someone confirm that? Also, Graham, can you briefly explain why lunch and designated mask-break periods are being considered as exceptions? Is it purely for the mental health aspect or is there another reason?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "If I may add, David, regarding the measuring of mask-wearing effectiveness, shouldn't we look at not just case rates, but also absenteeism and, perhaps, even the impact on student wellbeing and learning overall? As we discussed previously, it's crucial to keep an eye on both the physical and mental aspects. Ellen, I'd love to hear your thoughts on incorporating those additional metrics."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, Kate. I completely agree with you. We should indeed consider the broader implications of mask-wearing on our students' wellbeing and learning outcomes. In terms of the data, I think it's essential to examine not just case rates but also the number of quarantines, hospitalizations, and any other relevant metrics that can inform our decision-making process.\n\nTo address David's question, I'd like to understand the reasoning behind the exceptions for lunch and mask-break periods. Graham, could you elaborate on the thinking behind that? Is it primarily centered around giving students a break from wearing masks or are there other factors at play?\n\nAnd, Katrina, I appreciate your diligence in seeking clarification on our current risk assessment. Could we get an update on the latest case counts and transmission rates within our schools? That would help us make a more informed decision on the mask policy."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "I appreciate the insightful points raised so far, especially the emphasis on considering student wellbeing and learning outcomes. To build upon that, I'd like to pose a question: How do we plan to support students who might struggle with wearing masks, particularly those with special needs or sensory sensitivities? Have we explored alternative solutions, such as clear masks or accommodations for students who cannot wear traditional masks? Additionally, Kate's point about absenteeism is crucial \u2013 can we discuss potential correlations between mask-wearing and attendance rates?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Excellent question, Judy. Addressing the needs of students with special requirements is paramount, and exploring alternatives is essential. Perhaps we could reach out to our special education department for further guidance on possible accommodations. Regarding absenteeism, I think it's essential to monitor that closely, possibly even setting up a task force to analyze the data and present findings. We should also engage with our counselors and social workers to better understand how mask-wearing affects students' emotional wellbeing. David, I'd appreciate your take on involving them in our discussions, as they're on the frontlines daily."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Judy, excellent question. We absolutely need to consider students with special needs and explore alternative solutions. I agree with Kate that reaching out to our special education department would be a great starting point. Additionally, I think involving our counselors and social workers is crucial in understanding the impact on emotional wellbeing. Kate, I'd be happy to facilitate that connection. Graham, could you brief us on any existing resources or plans for accommodating students who require special arrangements? On a related note, has the administration had any conversations with parents of students with special needs regarding mask-wearing concerns? Lastly, Judy, I'd like to circle back to your initial question \u2013 are there any precedents or best practices we can draw from regarding supporting students who struggle with mask-wearing due to sensory sensitivities or other reasons?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, David. I appreciate the willingness to involve our special education department and counselors in this discussion. Graham, I'd also like to hear more about any existing resources or plans for accommodating students who require special arrangements. It's essential that we ensure equity and inclusivity in our approach.\n\nJudy, regarding your question about precedents or best practices, I recall attending a conference where a neighboring district shared their experience with implementing alternative mask options for students with sensory sensitivities. They worked with occupational therapists to identify suitable solutions. Perhaps we could explore similar collaborations?\n\nAdditionally, I'd like to touch on Kate's suggestion about monitoring attendance rates and setting up a task force to analyze the data. I think that's an excellent idea. Could we discuss how we might integrate that into our existing data collection processes, and what kind of timeline we're looking at for presenting those findings?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Ellen, I appreciate your insight about the neighboring district's experience. Collaborating with occupational therapists could be incredibly valuable. Judy, perhaps we could schedule a call with that district to learn more about their approach? On the attendance rate analysis, I agree that integrating it into our existing processes makes sense. David, could you work with our data team to outline a plan and propose a timeline for reporting back to the board? Ideally, I'd like to see some preliminary findings by our next meeting, but we should prioritize accuracy over expediency."

  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Excuse me, please. I do apologize for interrupting, but since you brought up including counselors, Ellen and Judy, I want to reiterate the importance of engaging in active listening exercises with our students themselves. Their perspectives and experiences matter profoundly when developing policies. During these discussions, let's remember to balance quantitative and qualitative insights. And, of course, we need to weigh our actions against available scientific research. To support Judy's previous inquiry, have we given thought to partnering with experts or outside organizations with experience in working with individuals who face difficulties with mask-wearing? Perhaps we can receive guidance or even explore innovative ideas that could help us better cater to these students."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Absolutely, Katrina. Active listening exercises with students will provide invaluable insight into their experiences and concerns. I think engaging with experts or outside organizations is a fantastic idea, Judy. Could we explore partnerships with organizations specializing in supporting individuals with sensory sensitivities or disabilities? This might offer us innovative solutions and expert guidance. Graham, would it be possible to look into potential partners and report back to us? Additionally, I want to reiterate the importance of balancing quantitative and qualitative data. Kate, would it be feasible to incorporate student feedback and survey results into the attendance rate analysis task force? That way, we can ensure a holistic understanding of the situation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I completely agree with the suggestions made. Katrina, incorporating active listening exercises with our students is crucial, and I appreciate your emphasis on balancing qualitative and quantitative insights. David, exploring partnerships with organizations specializing in supporting individuals with sensory sensitivities or disabilities sounds like a great idea, Graham. Would you mind reaching out to organizations like the Autism Society of Central Virginia or the Arc of the Piedmont? I believe they might be able to provide valuable guidance. As for incorporating student feedback and survey results into the attendance rate analysis task force, I think that's an excellent suggestion. I'll make sure to add that to the scope of work. Graham, could you please provide an update on our current communication strategies with parents of students with special needs? Are there any existing channels or resources that we could leverage to gather their input and concerns?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Yeah, certainly. So just to give you a brief overview, at this moment, we actually communicate primarily via email with families of students who receive specialized services and accommodations. However, I do understand that we can definitely improve this process, especially considering the unique challenges presented by the pandemic. One possibility could be utilizing Parent Resource Center coordinators. They already act as a liaison between families and schools, so perhaps we could tap into those connections to collect information and provide support. But moving forward, I'm open to other proposals. We want to ensure that our communication strategy aligns with the community's needs and truly supports our students and families."

    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thank you, Kate, for circling back to my question about best practices for supporting students struggling with mask-wearing due to sensory sensitivities or other reasons. Ellen, I appreciate your suggestion about collaborating with occupational therapists; that seems like a great starting point. David, I'd love to explore the idea of partnering with outside organizations specializing in supporting individuals with sensory sensitivities or disabilities. Graham, would you mind adding the Arc of the Piedmont and the Autism Society of Central Virginia to the list of organizations to reach out to? Also, regarding our communication strategy with parents of students with special needs, I think leveraging the Parent Resource Center coordinators is a good step, but maybe we could also organize a town hall or Q&A session specifically tailored to address their concerns and gather their input. Kate, would it be possible to set up a separate thread or online forum for parents to share their thoughts and ask questions anonymously, if needed?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "I couldn't agree more, Judy. A town hall or Q&A session would provide a wonderful opportunity for us to listen to the concerns of parents and caregivers directly. And, Kate, an anonymous online forum is a brilliant idea \u2013 it would allow parents to share their thoughts without feeling uncomfortable or vulnerable. Graham, would it be possible to collaborate with our counseling department to facilitate such an event and ensure that we're addressing the emotional and psychological aspects of this issue as well? Perhaps we could also invite some of our own teachers who have experience working with students with sensory sensitivities to participate in the discussion and share their insights."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "I appreciate everyone's dedication to supporting our students with special needs and ensuring inclusivity in our mask-wearing policies. In terms of town hall meetings and online forums, those sound like valuable avenues to engage with our parent community. Kate and Graham, could you provide an update on how we're currently collecting parent and caregiver feedback, and how we plan to incorporate these new channels into our overall communication strategy? Additionally, Judy, your suggestion about having occupational therapists involved in developing guidelines is outstanding. I agree with Ellen \u2013 inviting our teachers experienced in working with students with sensory sensitivities will enrich the discussion. Have we considered engaging our school psychologists in this process as well?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Yes, absolutely, Jon. Engaging our school psychologists would bring another layer of expertise. I completely agree with Judy that an event focused on parents' concerns is essential and would allow for candid discussions. I think it was Ellen who suggested involving counselors too, right? That collaboration would help us delve deeper into the psychological impact of mask-wearing difficulties on these students and their families. Kate, David brought up incorporating student feedback into the attendance rate analysis task force. If possible, can we expand that to include insights gathered through the town hall and the anonymous online forum? The more diverse perspectives we capture, the more comprehensive our policies can be. It seems like many of these initiatives tie together beautifully."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I apologize for interrupting, but I wanted to clarify \u2013 Graham, could you confirm whether we have the necessary resources and personnel to accommodate an anonymous online forum and town hall meeting, given our current budget constraints? Perhaps we could explore existing platforms or tools within our district to minimize additional costs. Additionally, I agree wholeheartedly with Katrina's suggestion to involve school psychologists in the development of guidelines and potential collaborations. Jon, incorporating student feedback into the attendance rate analysis task force is essential, and expanding that to include insights from the town hall and online forum would indeed provide a more comprehensive understanding. Judy, I think it's a great idea to have a separate thread for discussing mask-wearing exceptions, so let's table that topic for now and come back to it later. Does anyone else have any comments before we move forward with implementing these initiatives?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Ah, sorry to jump in, Kate. You've covered everything, but I did want to quickly reiterate the importance of listening to teachers and students throughout this process. Their experiences and concerns will be invaluable in shaping our policies effectively. On that note, have we considered organizing a separate listening session exclusively for teachers to share their observations and ideas regarding the challenges students face with mask-wearing? This might help inform the guidelines and accommodations we develop going forward. Additionally, Judy, I love the idea of partnering with external organizations specializing in supporting students with sensory sensitivities. Let's make sure to prioritize that partnership and keep them involved throughout our policy development process."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Absolutely, David, a separate listening session for teachers would be incredibly beneficial in capturing their valuable insights and frontline experiences. I think that's an excellent suggestion. And, Judy, yes, please do add those organizations to the list. In terms of prioritizing our partnerships, Graham, could you work with our community outreach team to establish those connections and ensure they're actively engaged throughout the policy development process? Now, moving forward, shall we discuss potential timelines for organizing the town hall meeting, setting up the anonymous online forum, and scheduling the teacher listening session? Do we have any estimates for when these initiatives might take place?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thank you, Kate. I'm glad we're on the same page regarding the importance of listening to our teachers and students. David, your suggestion about a separate listening session for teachers is fantastic - I think it'll really help inform our approach. Kate, regarding timelines, I understand we need to balance expediency with thoroughness, considering our limited resources. Perhaps we could aim to organize the town hall meeting within the next four to six weeks and simultaneously launch the anonymous online forum? For the teacher listening session, would it be feasible to schedule it within three weeks, allowing us sufficient time to collect and integrate their feedback into our policy development? Graham, what are your thoughts on these proposed timelines, and can you confirm whether our counseling department is available to facilitate these events?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "I totally concur with the recommendations discussed here. Concerning our counseling department's availability, I believe they can contribute significantly to facilitating our town hall meeting and teacher listening session, but I must confirm with Dr. McLaughlin first. As regards the timelines, Judy, I think they appear reasonable, although we might have to adjust slightly depending on the complexity of setting up our anonymous online forum. Kate, you made a great point about using existing resources to minimize extra expenditures. I propose that we investigate if we already possess suitable digital platforms for hosting the forum or listening sessions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, Graham. I appreciate your diligence in confirming the counseling department's availability. Kate, regarding the online forum, wouldn't it be beneficial to also explore any potential partnerships with local universities or organizations that specialize in educational technology? They might offer valuable guidance on implementing a cost-effective and accessible platform. Additionally, Jon, your suggestion about involving school psychologists resonated with me. Could we also invite some of our district's speech-language pathologists to contribute their expertise, especially since they work closely with students who may struggle with mask-wearing due to sensory or communication needs?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "I fully agree with exploring those partnerships, Ellen. Our district's speech-language pathologists could certainly provide vital input for accommodations and potential alternatives. Ellen, did you happen to reach out to local special education advocacy groups? Any insights from those organizations could help shape effective and inclusive policies for our students."
