    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.1: COVID Mask Policy - The board will discuss the district\u2019s COVID-19 health protocols, specifically whether students should be required to wear masks while in classrooms. This policy would apply during the regular school day, with exceptions for lunch and designated mask-break periods. The goal is to balance student safety with comfort and learning effectiveness.. Who would like to start?"

    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thank you so much, Mr. Paige. I'd actually like to take a moment to really acknowledge, uh, parents' concerns both pro-mask and anti-mask, um, and students who've reached out to me as well. Their wellbeing \u2013 we're weighing two critical components here, which makes it tough for us as decision-makers."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Yeah, Katrina, I appreciate that acknowledgment. We do have a responsibility to listen to all stakeholders. Speaking of data, Graham, could you provide an update on the current case rates and risk assessment within our district? That'll help inform our discussion on the mask policy moving forward."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Absolutely, David. Thank you, Katherine. You did point us in a right direction, thank you. All right, our numbers currently stand at about 3.3, right now, cases per hundred thousand population. I hope I said that correctly.  And just looking at Dr. McLaughlin's slide, there were three slides provided with today's materials, right before us, you see where our trajectory is at present. So it has been trending upward very recently. Are we still, do you still want us to continue with that risk analysis chart or are those figures good enough right now?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I don't know, David, Graham, since we're talking about mask-wearing. Have we got a chance, possibly, can we get the presentation by Mr. Wolfe on how schools compare? In terms of masking compliance versus unmasked areas in these last two years and also have him explain what the CDC guidelines exactly state for us in different risk zones. That way we're making this decision based on evidence rather than anecdotes from families."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "If I may add, I think it would be helpful to consider not just the absolute numbers but also the trend. Our risk assessment committee has emphasized the importance of monitoring that upward trend, David. Have we consulted with local health experts regarding any adjustments they recommend given the recent rise in cases? We need to weigh comfort and learning effectiveness against safety concerns. Additionally, what sort of exceptions and accommodations are we considering for students with special needs or respiratory issues? And, Graham, could you confirm whether we have updated information on the effectiveness of mask-wearing in schools?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "I appreciate Kate's emphasis on the trend. It's crucial we keep our eyes on that trajectory. David, I'd love to hear more about those local health experts' recommendations. Were there any specific suggestions on implementing more targeted measures? Also, Graham, regarding the mask-wearing effectiveness, could you clarify if that data accounts for varying types of masks used in schools? Some studies suggest differences in protection levels, and I'd hate for us to make a decision without considering those factors."

    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, Judy. I think we're getting into some really important details here. Before we dive deeper, I just want to acknowledge Jennifer Johnston from Child Nutrition Services. I understand she's been working hard behind the scenes to ensure our students receive nutritious meals despite the pandemic challenges. Let's give her a round of applause.\n\nRegarding the mask policy, I completely agree with Kate about considering exceptions and accommodations for students with special needs. We need to prioritize their safety and comfort as well. Graham, could you please clarify what kind of accommodations we're thinking of for these students? Have we consulted with our special education department to ensure we're covering all bases?\n\nAlso, Judy, I appreciate your question about the effectiveness of mask-wearing. I'd love to hear more about those studies suggesting differences in protection levels between various types of masks. Should we be recommending specific types of masks for our students? Would that be feasible?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Thank you, Ellen. I appreciate your shoutout to Jennifer Johnston and the hard work of Child Nutrition Services. In regards to mask-wearing, I would like to piggyback off Judy's question about consulting local health experts. Did those experts express any thoughts on whether a combination of mitigation strategies beyond masking, such as social distancing and improved ventilation systems, would better protect our students and staff compared to solely relying on masks? What specific measures are we taking to improve air quality in our schools? Could we also explore a brief update on contact tracing measures to prevent outbreaks in high-risk settings?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Jon, I think that's an excellent line of questioning because social distancing is another area where I've gotten a lot of feedback from families. Parents mentioned struggles with it due to class sizes and available space. So, I definitely feel like exploring the efficacy of those alternative measures further would allow us to paint a complete picture and find more effective solutions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Exactly, Katrina. Thank you for echoing that concern. It feels like a holistic approach would serve us best. Social distancing is indeed crucial, yet classroom setup limitations pose significant barriers. Dr. O'Berg mentioned earlier the need for weighing different viewpoints; let's keep that consideration in mind when discussing alternatives to masking. How might a multi-faceted strategy that takes into account the specific dynamics of each school help strike a balance between addressing those concerns and maintaining that delicate balance between safety, comfort, and academic success?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Ah, wow, lots to unpack here. First, thank you, Ellen, for acknowledging Jennifer's efforts \u2013 truly appreciated. Now, I think we're on the same page regarding exceptions and accommodations for students with special needs. Graham, can you provide more insight into the accommodations you were considering? And, Judy, I'm intrigued by those studies on varying mask types; I'd love to get more information on those. Perhaps we could invite a local health expert to discuss those findings and provide guidance on recommended mask types.\n\nMoving on to social distancing, Katrina, I completely agree that it's a challenge, especially with larger class sizes. Jon, I think your suggestion to examine a combination of mitigation strategies is spot on. Air quality improvements, contact tracing, and ventilation system upgrades are all worth exploring. Graham, can you update us on our progress regarding those measures?\n\nLastly, I believe we need to maintain open communication channels with our teachers, students, and parents. As we weigh the pros and cons of mask mandates, we must prioritize their input and concerns. Maybe we could schedule town hall meetings or surveys to gather more feedback and better understand the pulse of our community. Any thoughts on that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "If I may interject, I wholeheartedly agree with David's suggestion for seeking more community input, especially from teachers who are crucial in implementing any changes. Surveys and town halls would provide invaluable feedback. Meanwhile, to Jon's point about air quality, I'd like to inquire about the status of our indoor air quality testing initiative launched last semester. Have we received any updates on air quality monitoring results since then? And, Graham, on exceptions for students with special needs, would it be possible to share any potential accommodation models being considered, perhaps ones already implemented in similar districts?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thank you, Kate, for bringing up teacher input \u2013 that's essential. David, I appreciate your idea of involving local health experts; that would provide valuable guidance. Graham, regarding accommodations, could you elaborate on how you envision incorporating feedback from our special education department and families of students with special needs? That collaboration will ensure we're catering to their unique requirements.\n\nOn air quality, Kate, I second your inquiry about the status of our indoor air quality testing initiative. Has there been any progress on installing those air purifiers in classrooms, particularly in areas with poor ventilation?\n\nJon, I concur that social distancing poses significant challenges. Perhaps we could explore adapting our scheduling to reduce congestion in common areas, at least until cases decline further? And, Graham, could you touch upon the current contact tracing protocols in place, specifically how they've been working in practice?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "I appreciate the thoughtful discussion, everyone. David, I completely agree on the importance of maintaining open communication channels. Scheduling town hall meetings or surveys is an excellent way to gather feedback from our community. Perhaps we could also consider forming a task force consisting of teachers, administrators, and parents to provide ongoing input on our COVID-19 response.\n\nKate, thank you for following up on the indoor air quality testing initiative. I'd like to know the status of those results as well. Graham, could you please update us on the air quality monitoring results and any plans for improving ventilation systems?\n\nJudy, I like your idea of adapting our scheduling to reduce congestion in common areas.

Regarding contact tracing, I'd also like to hear more about the current protocols in place.\n\nBefore we move forward, I just want to reiterate the importance of prioritizing our most vulnerable students. As we explore these alternatives, let's keep in mind the need for equity and accessibility in our approach. Jon, your emphasis on a holistic approach resonates with me. By considering multiple strategies, we can create a safer and healthier environment for everyone. Shall we schedule a follow-up meeting to discuss these ideas further and gather more input from our community?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Absolutely, Ellen. I couldn't agree more on the importance of prioritizing our most vulnerable students. Thank you for encapsulating the essence of our discussion today. In terms of equity and accessibility, we need to remain vigilant about unintended consequences that potentially affect specific demographics differently.\n\nRegarding the next steps, I fully endorse holding a follow-up meeting to delve deeper into these topics, invite local health experts, and continue soliciting input from teachers, parents, and students alike. Perhaps we could aim to schedule it within the next two weeks to maximize attendance and engagement. Would that work for everybody?\n\nAlso, Kate, I want to echo your curiosity about the indoor air quality testing initiative. Graham, could you enlighten us on the latest developments regarding that project?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Just quickly, I agree with Ellen on the importance of having our priorities right \u2013 safety and vulnerable students, along with maintaining communication. To build on David's point about hearing more from teachers, I wanted to reiterate the significance of creating opportunities for both staff and the student body to contribute their perspectives as well. So, yeah, the surveys and town hall concept sounds quite reasonable to me. Plus, echoing some points made by Kate and Judy, the indoor air quality thing needs an update from Graham, please. Also, what was the final update on scheduling? Did we decide on when we are going to meet again? Within two weeks?"
