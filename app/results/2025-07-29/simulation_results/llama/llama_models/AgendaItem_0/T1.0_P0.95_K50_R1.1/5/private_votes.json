    "comment": "After listening to various insights, ideas, and concerns presented on requiring masks in classrooms, I am in favor of a mandate to ensure consistency and student safety across our district. This aligns with my primary goal of keeping everyone healthy and well. However, we also need to seriously explore ways to enhance our support structure for students genuinely struggling with compliance."
