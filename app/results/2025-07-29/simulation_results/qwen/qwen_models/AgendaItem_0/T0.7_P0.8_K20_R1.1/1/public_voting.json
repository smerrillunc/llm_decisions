    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.1: COVID Mask Policy - The board will discuss the district\u2019s COVID-19 health protocols, specifically whether students should be required to wear masks while in classrooms. This policy would apply during the regular school day, with exceptions for lunch and designated mask-break periods. The goal is to balance student safety with comfort and learning effectiveness.. Who would like to start?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thanks, Graham. I wonder how many parents are still concerned about masking, given the current case rates. Maybe we could check in with the superintendent on that?  \n\nI think it's important we hear from our teachers\u2014do most feel safe without mandatory masks right now?  \n\nAnd Ellen, since you\u2019ve been involved in wellness discussions, what does your experience suggest about kids\u2019 mental health under different mask requirements?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thank you, David. I agree that we need to get some information about parent concerns and feelings among staff. I'm not sure that we're able to get that kind of survey information at this time, but maybe someone has an idea about how we might go about doing that.\n\nI do think that the impact on learning, because of course, there's so much nonverbal communication between students and teachers, is something we really need to consider here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Kate. I appreciate that perspective.  \n\nDavid, I\u2019m wondering\u2014how confident are we that any data we *could* collect would actually reflect parental concerns accurately?  \n\nAlso, I\u2019d love to hear from Superintendent Gentry on whether we\u2019re seeing trends in student or teacher comfort levels around masking.  \n\nEllen, could you share what your wellness team has observed about emotional wellbeing related to mask mandates?  \n\nAnd Katrina\u2014I know you\u2019ve done a lot of outreach; do you think families would respond well to a quick poll?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thanks, Judi. I've heard mixed things from teachers\u2014some say it's no big deal, others worry about losing connection with students.  \n\nKate, did you see anything in the last round of surveys about kids\u2019 mental health when masks were required?\n\nJudyle, have you found that parents tend to lean toward either side based on past patterns?  \n\nDavid, I wonder if we could ask principals to check in informally with staff\u2014just a quick pulse check?  \n\nKatrina, how many families do you think would actually reply to a quick poll like that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Thank you all for these great points. I think we've got a couple of good ideas already. Would someone please send out a quick email to all the principals asking them to do just a quick informal check-in with their faculty? And then, maybe, would someone else please send an email out to the PTA leaders across the system and see if they would mind sending a quick note home to their membership? I'd love to see if we can gather some early impressions before next week's meeting."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thank you, Jonno. So, I guess my first question would be, who's going to send those emails?  I guess, I'll take the principal email, unless anyone wants to volunteer. And then, I'm happy to reach out to the PTA leads, although I don't know if I want to do that after today. But, yeah, I mean, I guess we could do that.  Do we have any thoughts about the format of the message? Should it be a specific list of questions? Or should it just be more general?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Katina, I think a brief, open-ended question works best\u2014like, \u201cHow are you feeling about mask-wearing in schools?\u201d  \nGraham, could you draft a sample email to principals?  \nJonno, could you confirm with the PTA leads that they\u2019ll forward it?  \nMaybe we could add, \"Please let us know if you'd like to share examples,\" to encourage stories.  \nI think a few anecdotes could help us understand the real impact better.  \nWould anyone object to sharing a few anonymous examples at the next meeting?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I think we need to make clear that we are gathering information, not making a decision. I mean, clearly, we're trying to find out where folks are. I guess I would hope that the results would be fairly representative, but I suspect they won't be. \nBut, yes, I would like to hear what our teachers have to say. I don't know if we have a way to get back to the teachers anonymously."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Kate. I appreciate that caution.  \nDavid, do you think teachers would be more likely to share honest feedback anonymously?  \nEllen, could we explore having Wellness team members facilitate small group chats with staff\u2014something low-pressure, maybe over Zoom?  \nKatrina, would you be willing to loop in the PTA leads again tomorrow morning?  \nAnd Graham\u2014if you could draft that template email, I\u2019d appreciate it.  \nJust to clarify: Are we planning to release findings publicly after the next meeting?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Judi, I think small groups could work\u2014maybe one per school, keep it light.\nKatrina, could you please confirm with PTAs by tomorrow morning if they\u2019ll pass along the note?\nGraham, will you draft that email template for principals?  \nDavid, I wonder if teachers would trust anonymity even if we promise it\u2014what\u2019s your gut?  \nJudyle, do you think Wellness team members would be comfortable leading those chats?  \nKate, shall I ask Dr. Gentry if she\u2019d mind checking in with her office staff too?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Judi, thank you very much. I think we've got a number of good items to move forward on. Could everyone please give me a thumbs up if you agree with moving ahead with getting a couple of quick notes out to the principals and the PTA leaders? Great. Thank you. And thank you all for being so engaged in helping us get some information together."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Okay, I'll go ahead and try to loop in the PTA leads. I guess, David, if you wanted to draft a template, I could send it along to them. I don't know how long that takes. I'm assuming it wouldn't take long, but I guess we'll see."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Katrina, I'll draft something tonight\u2014probably won\u2019t take longer than ten minutes.  \nGraham, do you think you could review it quickly before I send it out?  \nDavid, I think a simple, warm tone works best\u2014nothing too official.  \nDo you think we should include a deadline for replies? Maybe Tuesday afternoon?  \nIf we wait until Monday, will that be enough time to get meaningful responses?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "It depends, doesn't it, on whether the principals or the PTAs respond right away. I guess we might just have to wait and see."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, David.  \nGraham, could you please review David\u2019s draft when he sends it?  \nKatrina, do you think we\u2019ll get more honest answers if we ask directly about masking, or should we frame it around overall comfort?  \nEllen, would you mind looping in the Wellness team to brainstorm facilitation approaches?  \nAnd Kate, do you think we should suggest a timeframe\u2014say, replying by Thursday\u2014to keep momentum?  \nJust wondering\u2014how many principals do you think will actually follow through?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Judi, I\u2019ll call the Wellness team later today to talk options.  \nKatrina, do you think most principals will reply by Thursday?  \nGraham, please review David\u2019s draft when he sends it.  \nDavid, should we ask specifically about masks or keep it broad?  \nKate, I wonder if parents would feel safer knowing kids were masked.  \nJudi, how many principals do you think will actually respond?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "So I think we've got a lot of good ideas going here. I think it's really helpful that we're thinking through these different ways to gather data.  Would someone mind sending me a copy of the final version once it's been vetted? And I look forward to seeing what comes back."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Yeah, I can definitely loop in the PTA leads. I was going to check my calendar and see if there's anything conflicting with it. But yeah, I'll loop them in and then hopefully they'll be able to spread it around."
