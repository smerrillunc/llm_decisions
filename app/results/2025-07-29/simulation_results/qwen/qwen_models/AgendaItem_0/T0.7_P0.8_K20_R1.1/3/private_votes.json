    "comment": "After hearing the concerns expressed by both Dr. Osborne and Ms. Callens, and considering that the science does seem to indicate that masking helps reduce transmission, especially among younger people who aren't vaccinated yet, I feel compelled to vote yes on this item. It also seems that many families may be more comfortable knowing that students are masked while indoors. So my vote is yes."
