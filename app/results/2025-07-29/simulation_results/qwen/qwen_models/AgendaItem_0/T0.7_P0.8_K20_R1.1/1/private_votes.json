    "comment": "The only thing I would say about the survey question is just that when I read it, it felt like kind of a leading question. Like why do you feel uncomfortable wearing a mask in school? That seems like it's already assuming people don't want to wear masks. Maybe something more neutral like, how comfortable are you with wearing a mask in school? Or do you feel safe at school? Just so that it doesn't sound like it's pushing kids towards a certain answer."
