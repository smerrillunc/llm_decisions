    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.1: COVID Mask Policy - The board will discuss the district\u2019s COVID-19 health protocols, specifically whether students should be required to wear masks while in classrooms. This policy would apply during the regular school day, with exceptions for lunch and designated mask-break periods. The goal is to balance student safety with comfort and learning effectiveness.. Who would like to start?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thanks, Graham. I think it\u2019s important we hear from our teachers first\u2014have they noticed changes in classroom dynamics since implementing or lifting mask requirements? Kate, maybe you could share what you\u2019re hearing from the field?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "David, I think I'm hearing from my constituents who are parents that there's still anxiety out there around kids being exposed to viruses at school. But how are our teachers feeling about the change in masking?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "That\u2019s a really good point, Kate. I wonder if our teachers feel comfortable sharing honestly how they\u2019re managing the shift in expectations. Jon, maybe you could check in with them directly?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, David. I\u2019m wondering how many teachers actually responded to that survey you mentioned earlier? I\u2019d love to see those numbers before we go further. And Katrina, when you talk to families, are you getting feedback from those who\u2019ve been hesitant about returning to school because of safety concerns?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Hi, Judi. Thank you so much for raising that issue. I don't know the exact number offhand, but I can look that up later. I guess I'd just say I've gotten mostly positive feedback from families saying they're happy to get back to normal. But I agree with you. It would be helpful to see exactly how many people filled out that particular survey. So let me take note of that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thanks, Judith. Could you clarify what kind of survey results you're referring to? Is it specific to teacher comfort levels with current policies?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Thank you all for these great comments. I'll echo the appreciation to Dr. Caffrey for her work over the last couple of years. And I was going to mention something very briefly, which is that I did receive two emails today. One from a parent asking why there was no notice given to the school board ahead of time about this agenda item, and another email from someone else expressing disappointment in the fact that there were no updates related to any additional funding sources for the district. And I just wanted to acknowledge both of those."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Ellen, I am sorry. I didn't hear your whole sentence. I apologize. Would you mind repeating that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "I think it\u2019s fair to acknowledge the concern about timing, Jon. I mean, I understand the frustration\u2014but I also want us to stay focused on the data. Ellen, I hope you don\u2019t mind\u2014I\u2019d like to redirect this quickly to the clinical side. Are we seeing a trend in cases among unvaccinated children that might affect our recommendations?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "David, I think it's possible that we're beginning to see an uptick in cases, although I haven't seen anything definitive yet. I suppose it depends on where you look. If you look at the countywide case rate, it's fairly low. But I think our nurses have told us that the rates within our schools may be higher than that. I guess I'd like to hear more about that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Kate, I appreciate that. Do you know if those trends are consistent across different grade levels? And Ellen, I wonder if you've heard from staff about how they're coping with the shifting guidance?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Judith, yes, I\u2019ve heard from several staff members who said they\u2019re struggling with the constant changes. Have you spoken with anyone in Child Nutrition recently?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "I haven\u2019t, Ellen. Maybe we should reach out? Also, has anyone looked into how staffing shortages might impact our ability to enforce these policies consistently?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Yes, I agree with you, Judith. I was talking with a few folks yesterday afternoon. And one of the things that came up is that we had three different meetings scheduled for Friday morning. One was a special meeting for the school board. One was a meeting of the Albemarle County Health Department. And then one was a meeting of the Albemarle County School Board Executive Committee. And I think we got a message from someone indicating that they weren't able to attend the meetings. Because the meetings overlapped. And I just thought that was interesting."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Jon, that\u2019s worth noting. I wonder if scheduling conflicts like that are affecting participation, especially among those most impacted by decisions? And Davidoberg, do we have data on attendance at past board meetings when similar decisions were made?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Hey, Judith. Sorry. I don't know the answer to that. I'm trying to figure out where that information would come from. I assume it's on the website somewhere."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "I think we should look at that, Judith. Please pull the attendance logs from prior meetings on health-related items and compare them. I suspect we\u2019ll find lower turnout, but we should verify. Ellen, can you confirm whether staff are getting clear messaging on shifts in protocol?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Ellen, I think I saw a memo sent to staff last week. Was that about the new policy? I don't remember reading it myself."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Kate, I did see that memo\u2014wasn't sure if everyone got it. Did you get a chance to read it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Ellen, I appreciated your comment earlier about the challenges staff face. I wonder if we\u2019ve considered doing brief check-ins with teams to gauge morale? And Katrinacallsen, would you be willing to help track down those attendance logs?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Judith, that\u2019s a good idea\u2014should we pilot a quick pulse check with a few departments first?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Thank you all. I think we've covered quite a bit here tonight. I really appreciate everybody taking time out of their evenings to do this. I do think that we've done a lot of ground work already. And I certainly appreciate Ms. Callens' effort in putting together that presentation. And I think that it gives us a pretty good basis for making decisions moving forward."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Yeah, I second that motion. I do think we have enough information right now to make a decision. I will point out that we have a vote coming up tomorrow night. That is the same day that we are voting on mask mandates. And so I think it would be prudent to wait until after that vote happens to try to determine if there's gonna be a need to change our policy or not."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "I concur, Katrinas. Let\u2019s hold off on altering course until after tomorrow\u2019s vote. Judye, I\u2019d still like you to initiate those team check-ins next week. And Ellen, please confirm with HR whether all staff actually received the memo."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Judith, I don't know if you'd consider this helpful, but I think we could take advantage of our upcoming parent town halls to solicit input from parents on what they think we ought to do."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Thank you everyone for voting. After counting all the votes, we have 5 (public) / 1 (private) in favor, 0 (public) / 3 (private) against, and 2 (public) / 3 (private) abstaining. Results \u2192 Public: approved, Private: denied, Combined: approved. Thank you everyone for coming, have a nice night."
