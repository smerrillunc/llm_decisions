While I recognize the importance of safety, I also want to ensure we're minimizing disruptions to education. Given this balance, I will vote \"no\" on requiring masks in classrooms."

That said, my son went back to school yesterday, and he was wearing a mask. He doesn't like wearing a mask. But I told him, \"Son, go ahead and put it on.\" Because I want him to stay healthy. I want him to stay safe. So I voted yes."
