    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.1: COVID Mask Policy - The board will discuss the district\u2019s COVID-19 health protocols, specifically whether students should be required to wear masks while in classrooms. This policy would apply during the regular school day, with exceptions for lunch and designated mask-break periods. The goal is to balance student safety with comfort and learning effectiveness.. Who would like to start?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thanks, Graham. I think it's important we hear from our teachers and students first\u2014what do they feel safe doing? Maybe we could start by hearing how many kids actually *want* to wear masks right now?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "David, I think maybe what we need is an anonymous survey of our staff and our students to get some real-time information on where they stand."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thank you, Kate. I agree\u2014we definitely need that data. But I wonder, how soon could we get results back from something like that? And who exactly would we want to include?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Judi, good point\u2014I\u2019d love to know how quickly we could gather those results. Should we involve parents too, or just students and staff?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Ellen, great question. I'd say yes, parents too\u2014especially since their views likely affect how comfortable kids feel at home. Do we have capacity to run a quick survey across all three groups?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "That sounds reasonable, Judi. Could we please send out a quick poll next week to see how fast we could get answers from all three groups?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Hi Jonno, I'm curious\u2014are there already plans to conduct a student survey? Or is that something new we're proposing? Also, has anyone considered the impact of these surveys on our current risk assessment models?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Katrina, I think it's worth considering\u2014wouldn't it be helpful to see if our current case rates align with what students actually report feeling? Probably not perfect, but better than nothing."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Yeah, Dave, I guess my concern is making sure we're getting honest feedback. Are we asking them how they feel, or are we telling them what to feel?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Good point, Katrina. I think we need to make sure the survey asks open-ended questions\u2014not leading ones. Would you mind helping us draft that, please?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Sure, I can help with that. I guess my bigger concern though is, when we talk about safety, especially for vulnerable populations, are we using metrics beyond just case counts?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I mean, I think we really need to look at cases among unvaccinated children. I'm wondering, Katina, did you have any numbers on that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Not offhand, Kate. I don't think we've seen much data yet. I'll check."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Okay, so maybe we could look at that before we go forward with anything else."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "I appreciate that, Kate. I do wonder\u2014could we possibly get that breakdown within the next few days? I think having that clarity would help shape our thinking."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Judi, I\u2019ll check with Health Services\u2014can we pull that unvaccinated case rate for elementary students by Friday? Please let me know if you\u2019ve got someone specific to reach out to."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Sounds good, Ellen. Will you please loop me in once you get that info?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Sorry, Jonno. I'm still trying to figure out if I can get that information. If not, I can try reaching out myself."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Please keep me posted, Katina."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",

    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "I think we\u2019re moving in the right direction here. Honestly, I\u2019m hoping we can get that data soon\u2014probably by Thursday would be ideal."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I mean, I'm certainly supportive of that. I was just saying earlier, if we had a survey, then we'd be able to sort of triangulate that data."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Kate, I agree\u2014triangulating makes sense. But I do worry, will we even get enough responses to trust the results? Do we have a way to boost participation?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I don\u2019t know, Judi. I mean, I think we could ask principals to put it up on their web pages and perhaps email it to students and staff."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "That\u2019s fair\u2014but do we have bandwidth to manage that kind of rollout? I\u2019d hate for it to fall through because no one\u2019s tracking it."

    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Ok, that's enough, we will now vote privately.  We are voting on Agenda Item No. 3.1: Should the district require students to wear masks in classrooms during the school day?.  If each of you could please record your vote in the chat, I will tally them up and announce the results."

However, with the decline in cases, I am not sure it is necessary at this point. It is also difficult to enforce given the age range of our students.",
