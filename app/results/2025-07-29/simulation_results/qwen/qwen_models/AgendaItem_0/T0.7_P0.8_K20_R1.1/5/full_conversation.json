    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.1: COVID Mask Policy - The board will discuss the district\u2019s COVID-19 health protocols, specifically whether students should be required to wear masks while in classrooms. This policy would apply during the regular school day, with exceptions for lunch and designated mask-break periods. The goal is to balance student safety with comfort and learning effectiveness.. Who would like to start?"

  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thanks, Graham. I'm glad we're starting here today. \n\nI wonder what others are seeing out there in terms of case rates right now?\n\nCould someone please check the current numbers for us?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I'd love to hear from Dr. Grogan or Mr. Searcy, but maybe someone could just give us a quick update on the current situation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Kate.\n\nI\u2019m wondering how many cases we\u2019re seeing currently in schools versus elsewhere in the county?\n\nAnd does anyone know if those trends are holding steady or shifting?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thanks, Judith.\n\nCan we get a quick update on the current case rate trends in our schools compared to the broader county?\n\nI\u2019d also appreciate knowing how many positive tests we\u2019ve had over the past week\u2014especially any recent spikes?\n\nWould someone please pull up that data for us?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Good morning, everyone.\n\nDr. Grogan, Mr. Searcy, could you please provide us with a quick update on where things stand?\n\nIs it possible to get the latest data on case rates within our schools versus outside of them?\n\nHow many positive tests did we see last week?\n\nDo these numbers seem to be increasing or decreasing?\n\nAre we still seeing a lot of cases among vaccinated individuals?\n\nWhat has been the impact on instruction?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thank you, Jonno.  I'm interested in hearing more about how we're doing with regard to testing positivity. I guess my first question would be, can we look at the data between kids who are unvaccinated and those who are fully vaccinated? And then secondly, can we take a moment to talk about how we're tracking those numbers? Because I don't know if we've talked about that yet."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thanks, Katrin.\nI wonder if we could get an update on how well our screening testing program is actually working.\nMaybe we could compare the number of positives we find with the actual number of infections in the population.\nThat would help us understand how accurate our testing really is.\nCould someone please check that for us?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I was thinking along similar lines, David.  Do we have information on how many symptomatic students were tested and how many came back positive? That seems important to me."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Kate.  \nI wonder how many of those symptomatic students were actually masked when they tested positive?  \nCould someone please go through the symptom logs and flag which ones wore masks?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thanks, Judith.\nCould someone please cross-reference the symptom logs with mask-wearing records for positive cases?\nAlso, can we confirm how many of those symptomatic students were fully vaccinated?\nPlease let us know if there\u2019s a pattern emerging."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "I agree with all of that.\nThank you, Judith.\nI'm hoping we can get a little bit better sense of how effective masking has been across the different groups.\nWe're going to want to keep that information close at hand as we make decisions moving forward.\nIt sounds like we'll want to continue to collect data on this, correct?\nSo, Ms. Callson, would you please work with Dr. Grogan to ensure that happens?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thank you so much for the suggestion. I am happy to do that.  Just to clarify though, I think I need to make sure that I'm clear about exactly what kind of data we're looking for. So I'll reach out to Dr. Grogan after the meeting to figure out exactly what we're trying to gather."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thank you, Katrin.\nI wonder if we could get a breakdown by grade level too?\nMaybe we could see if younger students are getting infected more frequently than older ones.\nCould someone please run that analysis for us?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I definitely want to see the data broken down by grade level. I feel like it's always helpful to know. But I guess I'm curious why it makes sense to break it down by grade level. Is there something specific that you're expecting to see?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I suppose I'd like to know how many of our youngest students are being affected. It might be easier to track them."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Kate.\nI wonder if we could also get data on how many of those young students were masked when they got sick?\nCould someone please check that for us?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thanks, Judith.\nCould someone please verify how many of our youngest students were masked when they tested positive?\nAlso, can we double-check how many symptomatic kindergarten through third-grade students were fully vaccinated?\nLet\u2019s make sure we get that info before we decide on next steps."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "I think we're all beginning to see a trend emerge here.\nIt appears that most of the symptomatic children weren't wearing masks while they were ill.\nDoes anyone else have other thoughts about what might explain this?\nMs. Osborne, would you mind reaching out to Dr. Grogan again to get that data for us?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Sure. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.  I'm glad that you brought that up because I'm curious. How many of those kids were unmasked when they were symptomatic? Or rather, how many of them were symptomatic?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thank you, Katrin.\nI wonder if we could also get data on whether those unmasked symptomatic students were vaccinated or not.\nCould someone please check that for us?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I was wondering if we could also determine how many of those unmasked students were asymptomatic when they tested positive."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Kate.\nI wonder if we could also get data on how many of those unmasked students had symptoms before testing positive?\nCould someone please check that for us?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thanks, Judith.\nCould someone please pull data on how many unmasked, symptomatic students had prior symptoms before testing positive?\nAlso, can we check how many unmasked, symptomatic students were asymptomatic when tested?\nLet\u2019s make sure we\u2019ve got all the pieces."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Yes, ma'am.\nAnd I'd like to echo Mr. Page's request for additional data on vaccination status.\nCan we just check where things stand right now?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Yeah, I'm still confused. I guess I'm curious. Are we doing anything differently with our testing protocols based off of these results?"
  },
