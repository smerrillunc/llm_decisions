    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.1: COVID Mask Policy - The board will discuss the district\u2019s COVID-19 health protocols, specifically whether students should be required to wear masks while in classrooms. This policy would apply during the regular school day, with exceptions for lunch and designated mask-break periods. The goal is to balance student safety with comfort and learning effectiveness.. Who would like to start?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thanks, Graham. I think it's important we hear from our students and teachers first. Have we had enough feedback from them, or should we wait? Kate, what do you think about how much input we've actually gotten so far?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "David, I think we\u2019ve heard quite a bit, but maybe not enough. I\u2019d appreciate hearing more directly from students and staff. Would anyone else want to weigh in?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Kate. I agree\u2014student and staff voices matter. Do we have data on participation rates from those surveys? And I wonder if we\u2019re reaching the most impacted families\u2014especially in Title I schools\u2014is there a way to double-check that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Judy, good point\u2014I think we need better data on who responded, perhaps even stratified by school type. Maybe we could check with our communications team on that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thanks, Judy. Good point about Title I schools\u2014I wonder if our outreach was equally strong across all schools. Could someone please look into how many parents from those schools participated compared to others? Also, I'm curious\u2014do we know how many students actually wore masks consistently when they were allowed to take breaks? That seems important for understanding real-world compliance."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Thank you, Ellen. Great questions. And I second the idea of checking in with our comms folks to see how well we reached out to different communities. Might we also get some insight into which grades are complying best with mask-wearing\u2014or not\u2014and why?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Hi, everyone. So just following up on Ellen's last point. I guess my big concern is that we're making a policy based off of what we're told is happening. It's been reported that kids aren't wearing them, especially when they're supposed to be taking breaks. But I don't really have evidence to back that up. Is there any data available on actual observed behavior, because otherwise we're basing a very significant policy change off of anecdotes, and I'd hate to make a bad call here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Katrinia, I think you raise a valid concern. I\u2019m wondering if our building principals have seen patterns in consistent mask use or non-compliance among certain age groups. Judi, could you please check with the principals and gather some observational data from the field? I\u2019d love to understand what\u2019s actually happening in classrooms."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "David, I\u2019d like to echo that request. Judi, if you could also confirm how many students and parents completed the survey at each school level, I think that would help us assess the validity of the results."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Absolutely, David, Kate. I\u2019ll reach out to the principals right away and pull together anecdotal reports and attendance trends. I think it\u2019d be helpful to compare that with our survey completion rates by grade level. Does anyone have a sense of where those numbers stand already?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Judi, thanks. Before you dive in, could you please check if the principals noted anything specific about younger kids struggling more than older ones with mask breaks? I\u2019m thinking about elementary versus middle school dynamics. And if you find inconsistencies, let\u2019s flag those early."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Yes, thank you, Ellen. And Judi, could you also check whether there's any correlation between mask break frequency and student-reported discomfort or concentration levels? That could inform how long these breaks should be."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Okay, so I'll jump in after Judi gets the info. I guess I'm going to say something pretty controversial. I don't necessarily feel comfortable saying that we can require kids to wear masks inside classrooms without knowing exactly how effective they are at stopping transmission, particularly asymptomatic spread. Because I know I've read studies that show that the virus spreads primarily through droplets, and that's kind of what we're relying on to keep kids safe. So until we have better information, I'd rather err on the side of caution and maybe give ourselves more time to collect additional data."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Katrinia, I appreciate your caution. I wonder if we might consider asking Dr. Baskin to provide a brief update on current transmission rates and case trends within our schools. Judi, could you please coordinate that with her office? I think we need clearer data on risk assessment before finalizing policy."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "David, I'd like to second that request. Judi, if possible, could you also determine how many students are currently being tested regularly under our surveillance testing program? I think having that number would help contextualize our risks."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Definitely, David, Kate. I\u2019ll schedule a quick check-in with Dr. Baskin and ask for the latest case data. I think it\u2019d be useful to see positivity rates per school too. And yes, I\u2019ll get the testing numbers\u2014probably from the health department or our screening logs. Does anyone know whose records those would be?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Judi, while you\u2019re connecting with Dr. Baskin, could you please ask if she\u2019s noticed any patterns in symptomatic cases linked to mask-wearing consistency? I\u2019d also like to know how many students are still isolating due to exposure\u2014even if mild\u2014to help gauge overall impact."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "And Judi, if you could get the principal input on the kinds of concerns they\u2019ve heard from teachers and students regarding masking practices, that\u2019d be great. Would you mind doing that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Sorry, Judi. Just to add on to that, I mean, I'm assuming most of the feedback has come from the parents, but I don't know. Do we know if we've gotten teacher feedback directly related to the mask policy? I know we haven't surveyed them yet, but I would imagine that there's got to be some sort of qualitative feedback from them about what's working or not working."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Ellen, Jonno, Katrinia. I\u2019ll ask Dr. Baskin about symptom patterns and isolation counts. For the rest\u2014yes, I\u2019ll loop in the principals again and specifically ask about staff concerns. I think we could also check if any teachers shared thoughts in recent walkthroughs or surveys. Did anyone else hear about direct feedback from educators lately?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Judi, I think that\u2019s a solid approach. Could you please compile everything into a concise summary for the next board meeting? I\u2019d like to review both the data and stakeholder feedback before moving forward."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Sure, David. I\u2019ll put together a clear summary with key findings and quotes from principals and health data. Probably best to send it over midweek so folks can review. Does anyone foresee timing conflicts with other priorities?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Judi, I\u2019d like to suggest adding a line item to the agenda for our next regular meeting to discuss the recommendations from Dr. Baskin and the principals\u2019 feedback. Would that work for everyone?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "That makes sense, Kate. I\u2019ll draft an agenda item and circulate it ahead of time. Should we propose a specific time slot for discussion?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Judi, please go ahead and draft that agenda item\u2014I\u2019d appreciate seeing it by Wednesday. And while you\u2019re at it, could you check with Child Nutrition if lunchtime routines changed significantly during the last month? I\u2019m wondering if meal times affected mask compliance."
  },

    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Ok, that's enough, we will now vote privately.  We are voting on Agenda Item No. 3.1: Should the district require students to wear masks in classrooms during the school day?.  If each of you could please record your vote in the chat, I will tally them up and announce the results."
