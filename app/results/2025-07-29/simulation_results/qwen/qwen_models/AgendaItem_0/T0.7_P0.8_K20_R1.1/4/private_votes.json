    "comment": "I would vote \"yes\" on requiring students to wear masks in classrooms during the school day. The evidence shows that masking has helped reduce transmission rates of respiratory illnesses among children. With some teachers still expressing concern about getting sick at work, especially those who may not yet be fully vaccinated, wearing masks can help protect both staff and students."

    "comment": "As I stated earlier, I'm not sure whether my vote would make a difference because I don't know how many people are going to vote either way, but I guess I'll just say I'd vote yes. I mean, I can see both sides of it. But given the fact that we're still having cases and some districts continue to mask, I think it makes sense to continue masking until we have a better understanding of where things stand."
