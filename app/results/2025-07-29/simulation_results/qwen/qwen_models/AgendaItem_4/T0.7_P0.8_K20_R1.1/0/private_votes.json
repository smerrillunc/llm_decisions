    "comment": "The district has made significant progress in adopting an equitable math program, but concerns remain about its implementation and impact.  While it's important to continue improving access to high-quality math instruction, further consideration is needed regarding the feasibility of implementing these changes at scale. There are still questions around teacher training, student outcomes, and financial implications. Therefore, I am choosing to abstain from voting so we can ensure all stakeholders' perspectives are heard."

    "comment": "I agree with Dr. Osborne. I don't see any reason why we shouldn't adopt this new math program unless it creates major financial problems. So far, none of those seem apparent. It appears to me that this program has a lot going for it. The fact that it's research-based makes it attractive. So my vote is yes."
