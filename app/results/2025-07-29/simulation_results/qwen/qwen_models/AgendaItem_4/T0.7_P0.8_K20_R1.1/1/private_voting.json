Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.5: Curriculum Update - The board will consider adoption of a new mathematics curriculum for grades 6\u20138, aligned with updated state standards. The proposed curriculum includes digital resources, project-based learning activities, and teacher training components. Adoption is intended to improve student outcomes in algebra readiness and standardized test performance.. Who would like to start?"

    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thanks, Graham. I think it\u2019s great we\u2019re looking at this\u2014do we know how much the new math curriculum will cost per student?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "That's a good question, David. Does anyone here know what the projected cost per student would be for this new curriculum?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Well, I guess I'm wondering, Dave, whether we need another math curriculum. I mean, there's been an initiative over the past several years to improve math instruction across the county."

  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Kate. I agree, we\u2019ve made progress, but I wonder how this new curriculum specifically addresses algebra readiness gaps. Could someone share data on where those gaps still exist?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thanks, Judith. I\u2019d love to hear more about the specific algebra readiness gaps\u2014are they consistent across schools or concentrated in certain areas? And who\u2019s going to lead the professional development for teachers?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Thank you all for these thoughtful questions. I think it's really helpful to understand exactly which groups are most affected by these gaps. Maybe we could get some data on that soon. Would any of the principals like to comment on the results of the previous math program in terms of student achievement?"

    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I'd like to echo my colleagues' concerns about the cost. How does the budget account for additional expenses related to implementation?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "I appreciate that, Katrin. Do we have a clear breakdown of costs versus benefits, especially regarding long-term savings?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Yes, David, I would appreciate seeing that analysis. Also, I'm curious how many staff hours will go toward training."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Good point, Katrin. Are we factoring in teacher planning time for the rollout?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Probably so, David. But I don't see why we wouldn't just say that outright."

    "speaker": "kateacuff",

    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "I think we\u2019re doing well, Kate. I\u2019m actually glad we\u2019re digging into costs and training. Do we have estimates on how many hours each teacher might spend preparing?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Judith, yes, please\u2014can we get those prep hour estimates? And does the training include hands-on practice, or is it mostly theory?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Ellen, I second that. Hands-on practice seems critical\u2014do we know if trainers will model lessons with real examples?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Great question, Judith. I\u2019d like to know\u2014will the trainers use actual classroom materials, or just talk through them?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "I think we've got some solid questions coming up here. Judi, do you think we should bring Dr. Smith back tomorrow night to answer some of these questions? Or perhaps next week instead?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Jonno, I'd rather meet with him after the vote than before. I don't want to make his job harder."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Fair enough, Katrin. I think we should keep the door open for feedback\u2014even after the vote."
  },

    "content": "David, can I ask when you plan to submit written comments?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "I\u2019ll try to send mine by Thursday, Katrin\u2014does that work for you?"

    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Yeah, that works for me."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",

    "speaker": "judyle",

It gives us an opportunity to get students more engaged with math, which is something that I think all of us would like to see. And I think the way they're doing it with the program is very interesting. They're not just teaching math. They're teaching critical thinking skills, problem solving, communication. And I think that's important because I know many people out there feel that the current system isn't working.",
