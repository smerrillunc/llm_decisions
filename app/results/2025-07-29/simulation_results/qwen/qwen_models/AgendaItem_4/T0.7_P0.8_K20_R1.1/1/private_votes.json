It gives us an opportunity to get students more engaged with math, which is something that I think all of us would like to see. And I think the way they're doing it with the program is very interesting. They're not just teaching math. They're teaching critical thinking skills, problem solving, communication. And I think that's important because I know many people out there feel that the current system isn't working."
