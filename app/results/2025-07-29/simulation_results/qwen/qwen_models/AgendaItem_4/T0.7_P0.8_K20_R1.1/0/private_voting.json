    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.5: Curriculum Update - The board will consider adoption of a new mathematics curriculum for grades 6\u20138, aligned with updated state standards. The proposed curriculum includes digital resources, project-based learning activities, and teacher training components. Adoption is intended to improve student outcomes in algebra readiness and standardized test performance.. Who would like to start?"

  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thanks, Graham. I know there\u2019s been a lot of work behind this\u2014Ellen, could you walk us through how the alignment with the state standards was verified? I think it\u2019s critical we get this right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thank you, David. I think maybe Ellen or Jonna could speak to whether we\u2019ve confirmed alignment with the state standards. Maybe someone else has more insight into what that means."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Kate. I'm glad we're discussing this.  \nI'd like to understand how exactly we're verifying alignment\u2014could Ellen or Jonna clarify the process?  \nMaybe we could also talk about how this impacts students who are already struggling with math?  \nIt seems really important that any new materials support those learners first."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thank you, David, Kate, and Judy. I\u2019ll start\u2014I think we did have teams check alignment against the state standards, but let me double-check that.  \n\nDo we have documentation showing how each standard was mapped?  \nJonna, were you involved in that part?  \n\nAnd Judy, yes\u2014those students matter most. Do we know how this curriculum specifically helps them?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Well, Judy, thank you for raising that point. I wonder if Dr. Coughlin or Ms. Callahan might chime in on that particular issue. Because I think we all agree that those kids matter most. And I\u2019d love to hear how they\u2019re going to benefit from this."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Jonna. That\u2019s helpful.\nDr. Coughlin, Ms. Callahan\u2014do you both have thoughts on how this curriculum supports students who are struggling with math?\nI\u2019m wondering if we\u2019ve looked at data from pilot programs or earlier implementations.\nCould we please see that information before finalizing adoption?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thank you, Judy, for asking that. I'm curious too about how these pilots went because I know we've implemented some of these things prior to now. So can we please get some data points around that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Judy, Jonna, Katrinia, great questions. I wonder if we could request a summary report on the pilot results\u2014especially for struggling students. Could we assign that to the team by next week?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I guess my question is\u2014are we planning on doing anything special for our students who struggle with math, or are we just relying on the fact that this curriculum will help? I mean, I think it's an excellent idea to go ahead and try something different. But I hope we'll still look at the students who are having trouble."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Kate. I appreciate that.\nCan we confirm that additional intervention supports won\u2019t be cut if we adopt this new curriculum?\nAlso, I wonder\u2014how much professional development time is built in for teachers to learn these tools effectively?\nWould someone please provide a timeline for when training would happen?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Great questions, Judy.  \nLet me pull up the PD schedule\u2014if we haven't finalized it yet, could someone assign that today?  \nAnd Judy, yes\u2014we definitely don\u2019t want to cut existing supports. Does anyone know if those are protected?  \nKate, do we have a list of current intervention services so we can compare?  \nMaybe we should verify that funding stays put before moving forward."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Yes, thank you, Ellen. And, Judy, I echo that thought. You know, I think that\u2019s extremely important. And I think it\u2019s very likely that that is true, but I sure would like to hear confirmation from somebody. I would like to hear from Dr. Coughlin or Ms. Callahan, or even Mr. Page, if he wants to jump in, on that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thank you, Jonna. I second that motion. It's kind of hard to imagine cutting intervention services after adopting a new curriculum."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "I agree with you both. I think we should make clear that no existing supports are eliminated unless we formally vote otherwise. Could we please document that commitment in the minutes?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Well, I certainly hope not. But I think we need to be careful. If we had extra money, then okay. But I guess I am concerned about how much of this is funded."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Dave. I appreciate that.\nKatrina, do you have an estimate of how much of this is currently funded versus needing new allocations?\nAnd Judy, since you raised it\u2014can we get a detailed budget breakdown before we finalize?\nWe shouldn\u2019t assume funds are secure without seeing where they come from."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Judy, good point\u2014let\u2019s get that budget detail soon.\nDoes anyone know if the new curriculum uses existing tech licenses or requires new ones?\nJonno, could you check with IT on licensing costs?\nAnd Kate, yes\u2014funding sources matter. Let\u2019s assign someone to map out current vs. new expenses by Thursday."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Yes, thank you, Ellen. And I think that\u2019s a very good idea. Would you mind assigning that to Ms. Lippert or to Ms. O\u2019Donnell? And if she doesn\u2019t know, perhaps she knows who does."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Jonno, assigned to Ms. Lippert\u2014please reach out to IT and get clarity on license use and costs.  \nLet\u2019s get that by Thursday\u2014thanks."

    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Sounds good."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Well, I would say we're not there yet. I mean, I think we're trying to figure out what we want to do here. I mean, I think we ought to have some more information than we have right now."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Kate. I think that\u2019s fair.\nEllen, can we clarify whether \u201cby Thursday\u201d means draft or final?\nAnd Jonna\u2014could you please confirm with Ms. Lippert that she understands the scope?\nWe\u2019ll need to know exactly what\u2019s covered before deciding if we can afford this shift."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Yes, I will do that. Thank you, Judy. And I\u2019ll check back with her tomorrow morning and make sure that she understands exactly what needs to be done."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Judy, let\u2019s aim for a draft by Thursday\u2014clearer timing helps us decide if we move forward.\nJonna, please confirm with Ms. Lippert by tomorrow morning that she gets the full picture\u2014costs, licenses, everything.  \nThanks."
