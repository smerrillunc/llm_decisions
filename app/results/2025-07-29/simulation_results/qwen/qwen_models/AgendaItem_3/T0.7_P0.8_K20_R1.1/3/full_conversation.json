    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.4: Student Code of Conduct - The board will review proposed updates to the district\u2019s Student Code of Conduct, which outlines behavioral expectations and disciplinary procedures. Key changes include new rules around cell phone usage during instructional time, updates to the dress code to reflect inclusivity and professionalism, and revisions to disciplinary consequences to promote restorative practices.. Who would like to start?"

  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thanks, Graham. I\u2019m wondering what feedback we\u2019ve gotten so far from teachers regarding the cell phone policy. Maybe it\u2019s worth checking in with them directly?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "That\u2019s a good point, David. I wonder how many of our staff members have actually seen the draft."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "I appreciate that, Kate. I\u2019d love to hear from our teachers too\u2014do we know who\u2019s been involved in reviewing the draft? And Ellen, maybe we could get an update on how many staff have actually seen it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thanks, Judy. I\u2019ll check with HR to see how many staff have viewed the draft. Do we know if anyone specifically asked for clarification on the cell phone use section?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "I'm wondering if there was any pushback or positive feedback when we did the survey earlier this year. Was there anything particularly surprising in the data?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "So I've read through the document, and I guess my first thought is, does this need to be revised now? It seems like most things are already covered. If we're going to make these changes, let me know, because I want to understand why."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Katrina, I agree that we don\u2019t want to revise just for revision\u2019s sake. I think we need to confirm whether the current policy really isn't working well enough."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Yeah, I mean, I guess I'd like to see some metrics. I'm curious, has there been an increase in cell phone usage? Or, wait, I'm kind of thinking about the opposite. Has there been a decrease in cell phone usage? I feel like phones are always out. I don't know if that's something we can control."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Well, I suspect it hasn't decreased, but I haven't looked at those numbers either. But I am concerned about the potential impact on learning. I suppose we'll learn more after next week's session with the parent advisory group."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "I agree, Kate. I wonder if we\u2019re getting meaningful feedback from parents yet. Maybe we should check in with them sooner rather than later?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I think that would be helpful, Judy."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "I'd also like to hear from our special education team\u2014have they had any concerns about how these changes might affect students with IEPs?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Good point, Judy. Please reach out to Special Ed and see if they\u2019ve raised any concerns about the updated dress code or cell phone rules. Could someone please loop in Jennifer Johnston on this too?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "I'm wondering how many of our high school kids were surveyed, and do we have any demographic breakdowns from the results?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I saw somewhere where it said it was 40% of high schools, but I didn't look up the demographics."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Jon, I think we should verify exactly how many students participated and whether the sample reflects our overall population."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Would somebody mind pulling that number and making sure we have it right before we move forward?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I think that\u2019s important. I think we ought to do that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "I second that, Jon. Could someone please pull those numbers and report back?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Yes, please pull the exact participation rate and demographic details from the survey. Does someone want to take that task?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Thank you all very much. I hope we can get that info soon."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I'm curious, though, if we got feedback from students themselves. Because I feel like if we're asking for change, it feels like we should go to the source."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "I agree, Katrina. We should definitely hear directly from students\u2014maybe we can schedule a brief session with a few focus groups?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I'd say yes, unless we can find out ahead of time."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Well, I would welcome hearing from students, but I would worry about how representative any small group might be."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Thank you everyone for voting. After counting all the votes, we have 5 (public) / 1 (private) in favor, 0 (public) / 0 (private) against, and 2 (public) / 6 (private) abstaining.
