    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.4: Student Code of Conduct - The board will review proposed updates to the district\u2019s Student Code of Conduct, which outlines behavioral expectations and disciplinary procedures. Key changes include new rules around cell phone usage during instructional time, updates to the dress code to reflect inclusivity and professionalism, and revisions to disciplinary consequences to promote restorative practices.. Who would like to start?"

  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thanks, Graham. \n\nI think it's important we hear from our students. \n\nDo you think the current policy is clear enough?\n\nMaybe we could get feedback from them.\n\nKate, maybe you want to kick us off?\n\nWhat are your thoughts on how we\u2019re handling this?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "David, I'm not sure what we heard at the last two meetings, but I thought we had pretty good feedback from the students.\n\nkateacuff: And I guess my question to the staff would be, did we survey the students?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Kate, thanks for raising that.  \n\nI wonder if we surveyed students specifically about cell phones\u2014especially those who rely on them for accessibility or communication.  \n\nCould someone confirm whether we\u2019ve gathered student input on each component, especially dress code and discipline?  \n\nAnd Ellen, since you mentioned the equity lens earlier, does this update feel equitable across different groups?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Judi, great point\u2014did we survey students on *all* aspects, especially accessibility?  \nEllen, do you think these changes help close the equity gap, particularly for marginalized students?  \nWould any of you suggest we pause before finalizing, just to gather more student voice?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Thank you all for the comments.\n\nJudie, I agree \u2014 we really need to know where our students stand on these topics.\n\nCan we please find out if they've been asked directly about cell phones?\n\nAnd, Ellen, what do you think about asking them again?\n\nWe don't want to miss anything here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "So, I do believe there was a survey done prior to the draft coming forward. That said, I am curious about whether there were any specific questions related to the dress code or the cell phone use. Because I know when I read through it, I felt like I didn\u2019t see those questions being posed."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Katrina, thanks.\nThat\u2019s helpful.\nI\u2019m wondering if we even got student input on the dress code.\nMaybe we should check that.\nGraham, could we ask staff to verify whether we actually surveyed students specifically on cell phones and dress code?\nAnd Ellen, do you think we should reconsider waiting until next month to finalize this?\nOr is now still okay?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I mean, I think we're doing everything right, Jon. But, Ellen, I'd love to know what the staff survey results were, because I haven't seen those."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Kate, I\u2019d appreciate seeing those results too\u2014specifically disaggregated data, if possible.\nDid we collect responses from both middle and high school students, especially those in special ed or ELL programs?\nJon, could we request that report from staff by Thursday so we can make an informed choice?\nAnd Ellen, I\u2019d love your perspective\u2014are we confident these updates truly reflect student voices, especially from underrepresented groups?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Judi, yes, I\u2019d appreciate seeing that breakdown too.  \nCould someone please pull those student survey results by Thursday?  \nEllen, do you think we\u2019re missing something big if we move ahead without confirming student input?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Okay, well, first off, thank you all for your input.\nI think that we definitely need to look into what the students have told us, especially regarding the dress code and cell phones.\nAnd Judi, I agree with you \u2014 let\u2019s get that data by Thursday.\nIs anyone else thinking that we should hold off until then?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I think I might be leaning towards holding off, just because I feel like we are trying to be responsive to student concerns and wanting to improve things. But unless we have verified that students are getting involved, it feels kind of disingenuous."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Katrina, I agree with you.\nIt feels disingenuous if we say we\u2019re being inclusive but don\u2019t actually check.\nGraham, can we please get that report by Thursday?\nAnd Ellen, do you think we should wait?\nBecause honestly, I\u2019d hate to go back and redo this later."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Well, I mean, I guess I'm surprised that we haven't received those reports already."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Kate, I\u2019m surprised too\u2014we agreed to receive those results after the draft came out.\nCould someone clarify why we haven\u2019t gotten them yet?\nAnd Ellen, I\u2019ll echo Jon\u2019s concern\u2014is moving forward without confirmed student input worth risking trust?\nPlease, could we get those numbers by Thursday so we can decide fairly?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Yes, I\u2019d like to see those results too\u2014especially from kids who rely on devices for access.\nPlease, could someone confirm whether we surveyed students on cell phones and dress code separately?\nIf not, should we pause until we do?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Well, thank you, everyone.\nI agree with Ms. Page, I think we ought to take another week to make sure that we have that information.\nAnd, Mr. Berg, perhaps we could table this for one week and come back next time with the data and make a determination based upon that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I will add that I hope we don\u2019t have to rework it. I hope we can work it in, but I would rather spend another week making sure we're doing it right than having to come back."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Katrina, I hear you.\nLet\u2019s not rush.\nGraham, can you please confirm with staff whether we surveyed students on cell phones and dress code separately?\nAnd Ellen, do you think we should wait until Thursday to review the full data?\nBecause honestly, I\u2019d hate to go back and redo this later."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I don't think we should wait until next month. I think we should wait until Thursday."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Kate, I agree\u2014we should get clarity by Thursday, not wait weeks.\nBut Ellen, I wonder\u2014do we risk losing momentum if we delay just one week?\nCould we possibly get a preliminary summary sooner, maybe even tomorrow?\nGraham, please check with staff and send over whatever we have by Wednesday at the latest."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Yes, let\u2019s get that summary by Wednesday\u2014ideally before lunch.\nGraham, please confirm with staff whether we surveyed students separately on cell phones and dress code.\nAnd Ellen, do you think we can manage that timeline?"
  },

    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
