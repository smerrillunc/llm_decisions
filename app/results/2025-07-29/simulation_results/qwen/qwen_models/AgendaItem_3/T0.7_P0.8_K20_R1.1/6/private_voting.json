    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.4: Student Code of Conduct - The board will review proposed updates to the district\u2019s Student Code of Conduct, which outlines behavioral expectations and disciplinary procedures. Key changes include new rules around cell phone usage during instructional time, updates to the dress code to reflect inclusivity and professionalism, and revisions to disciplinary consequences to promote restorative practices.. Who would like to start?"

  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thanks, Graham. Ellen, maybe you could kick us off? I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on how these updates align with our mission."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thank you, David. Ellen, what do you think about the updated dress code? I think it looks good, but I'm not sure we're ready for something like gender-neutral uniforms. Maybe we should just go with non-gendered apparel."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Kate. I appreciate the clarification. \n\nI wonder\u2014how many families have already expressed interest or concern about the gender-neutral uniform option?\n\nAnd does the data show any disparities in dress code enforcement across different student groups?\n\nI\u2019m glad we\u2019re moving toward inclusivity, but I want to make sure our approach is both practical and equitable.\n\nCould someone please walk through the restorative practice framework again?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thanks, Judith. I appreciate those thoughtful questions.\n\nDo we know how many families have reached out about the gender-neutral options so far?\n\nAnd yes\u2014I'd really like to see that data on whether certain student groups are disproportionately affected by current dress code enforcement.\n\nPlease\u2014can someone clarify how restorative practices actually work in classrooms? Do teachers feel equipped to use them effectively?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Yes, Judith, I agree with your concerns. And Ellen, I have a similar question: Is there anything being done to prepare the teaching staff to handle all of these changes when they come into effect? Because I suspect\u2014and I don't know\u2014that it's going to be overwhelming. Could we talk about that before we vote?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Judith, I appreciate your questions about equity and fairness in implementation.\n\nDavid, I think you said earlier that we need more data. Does anyone have that?\n\nJudith, can we get a report back on how many parents have contacted us about this?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Judith, I think we absolutely need better data on enforcement patterns. Katrinas asking\u2014is there a way to pull that together quickly?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I guess my next question would be who has been assigned to do that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I think that's an excellent question, Katrina. But I am wondering, Judy, did you mean to say that we had no data at all? Or was it that we didn't have enough? I thought we were working on getting more information."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Kate.\nI think I meant\u2014we haven\u2019t seen comprehensive data yet.\nMaybe we could get a brief update on where that stands?  \nAre we tracking incidents consistently across schools?  \nAnd honestly, I\u2019d like to know how much training teachers have received so far on restorative practices.  \nCan someone assign that info to us by next week?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Judith, I appreciate your push for clarity.  \nDo we have a timeline for collecting that enforcement data?  \nAnd please\u2014someone assign a teacher liaison to check in with staff about readiness for the new policies.  \nWe\u2019ve got to make sure our educators aren\u2019t overwhelmed.  \nWhat\u2019s the plan for rolling out training before August?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "OK, let me ask this because I've heard other things. Has anyone asked the principal associations or the superintendents about how they feel about the timing of this rollout? Because I think it's pretty aggressive. Would someone mind doing that? Please."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Jonno, I'll take that assignment."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Jonno, I think that's important. Katrina, can you confirm you\u2019ll reach out to the superintendent?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I think we ought to keep talking about this. It seems like most of our issues are related to implementation rather than policy."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Kate.\nI agree\u2014the details matter.\nBut I still wonder\u2014are we setting up our staff for success?\nCould we schedule a quick check-in with principals after the summer break?\nAnd maybe\u2014would someone please send a draft of the training materials to the board by July 1st?\nThat way, we can review them ahead of time."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Judith, I like that idea\u2014let\u2019s do a post-summer check-in with principals.\nPlease\u2014assign someone to draft those training materials by July 1st so we can preview them.\nAnd do we have a list of key points teachers need to understand before fall?\nIf not, can we get that compiled?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "OK, thank you. One last thing here. Have we talked to the SROs about this? I'm not saying we need to change anything, but I'd like to know if they're prepared for this. Could somebody please find out?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Jonno, I will take that task."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Jonno, thanks. Katrina, please confirm you\u2019ll contact the SROs."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Are we planning to survey the students, too? I worry that even though we're trying to make everything fairer, we may miss something that matters to the kids."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "That\u2019s a great point, Kate.\nI wonder\u2014have we considered student feedback in this process?\nWouldn\u2019t it help to hear directly from them?\nCould we assign someone to gather input from middle and high school students by mid-July?\nAnd while we\u2019re at it\u2014do we know how many families are likely to opt for gender-neutral uniforms?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Judith, good call\u2014student voice is vital.\nPlease\u2014assign someone to collect student feedback by mid-July.\nAnd do we know how many families have shown interest in gender-neutral uniforms yet?\nIf not, can we track that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Thank you, Judith. And thank you, Ms. Osborne. This is very helpful. Thank you, everyone."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "So I have just two quick ones. First off, David, I think you mentioned you wanted to know how many families have requested gender neutral clothing already. If you want me to go look at that, I can try to pull it up right now."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "grahampaige",
    "content": "Ok, that's enough, we will now vote privately.  We are voting on Agenda Item No. 3.4: Should the board adopt the revised Student Code of Conduct, including updates to cell phone policies, dress code, and discipline procedures?.
