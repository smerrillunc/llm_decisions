Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.4: Student Code of Conduct - The board will review proposed updates to the district\u2019s Student Code of Conduct, which outlines behavioral expectations and disciplinary procedures. Key changes include new rules around cell phone usage during instructional time, updates to the dress code to reflect inclusivity and professionalism, and revisions to disciplinary consequences to promote restorative practices.. Who would like to start?"

    "content": "Thanks, Graham. \n\nI\u2019d like to hear from Ellen\u2014how do you see the updated cell phone policy balancing student access to technology with classroom instruction?\n\nAnd Kate, what\u2019s your take on whether the revised dress code strikes the right balance between inclusivity and professionalism?\n\nJudie, could you help us understand how we\u2019ll communicate these changes effectively to families and students?\n\nKatrina, does it feel like the discipline changes align with our commitment to restorative practices?\n\nJon, did we get enough feedback from teachers on how these changes might affect their classrooms?\n\nGraham, given everything we\u2019ve discussed so far, do we need to revisit any past decisions related to student conduct?\n\nLet\u2019s make sure we\u2019re not overcomplicating things\u2014we want clarity, not confusion.\n\nEllen, just to double-check\u2014are we confident students will understand the new rules without getting lost in too much detail?\n\nKate, please remind me why we\u2019re pushing for stricter dress code enforcement now\u2014is there a specific issue we\u2019re trying to solve?\n\nJudie, could you clarify how we plan to train staff on implementing restorative practices consistently across buildings?\n\nKatrina, do we really need a separate committee to oversee this or could principals manage it locally?\n\nJon, has anyone asked what parents think about removing phones entirely during class?\n\nGraham, do we actually know how many violations we had last year under the current rule?\n\nDavidoberg: I\u2019m concerned we might be setting up another conflict between security and inclusion."

    "content": "Thank you, David. I guess my first question to you is how do we define professional? And then secondly, I'm wondering how many hours per week are they expected to wear uniforms?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, David.\n\nI think I agree with your concern about balance.  \n\nBut maybe we're missing something\u2014do we have data on how often cell phones *actually* disrupt learning?\n\nI wonder, Kat, do we have any evidence that strict dress codes improve attendance or behavior?\n\nJudie, how exactly do we plan to enforce the new rules fairly across schools?\n\nAnd Jon, when was the last time we surveyed students about these kinds of policies?\n\nMaybe we should check in with families before finalizing anything.  \n\nCould someone walk through how the training will roll out?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thanks, David.  \nI think the cell phone policy aims to limit distractions while still allowing access for learning tools.  \nDo we have data showing how often phones interfere with instruction?  \n\nKate, I'd say \"professional\" means respectful and appropriate\u2014not necessarily uniformed.  \nHow many hours weekly would students wear them?  \n\nJudie, communication plans should include parent meetings, flyers, and student orientation sessions.  \nAre those covered in the rollout strategy?  \n\nKatrina, restorative practices work best when trained properly.  \nCan we confirm all staff will get consistent training?  \n\nJon, have we heard teacher concerns about losing tech access?  \nIs there pushback?  \n\nGraham, let\u2019s keep it simple\u2014clear expectations matter most.  \nDoes this version avoid ambiguity?"

    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Sure, Jon.  \nWe\u2019ll launch training next month, starting with principals and lead teachers.  \nThen, each school gets a phased rollout\u2014first grade levels, then others.  \nDo you think that timeline works?  \nWe\u2019ll monitor progress weekly.  \nShould we add a check-in point after three weeks?"
