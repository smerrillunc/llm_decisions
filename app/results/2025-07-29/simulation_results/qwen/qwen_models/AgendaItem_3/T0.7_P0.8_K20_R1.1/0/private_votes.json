    "comment": "After reading through the comments, I still have concerns about punitive measures against students for losing their phones, particularly given that only six instances occurred throughout the entire school division during the course of the past school year.\nWhile I am supportive of efforts to prevent inappropriate use of technology, I worry that the current policy goes too far in terms of punishment.\nI'm also uncertain about how exactly we're going to implement this policy and how much it's going to cost.\nI don't have a strong preference either way, so I'm going to abstain."
