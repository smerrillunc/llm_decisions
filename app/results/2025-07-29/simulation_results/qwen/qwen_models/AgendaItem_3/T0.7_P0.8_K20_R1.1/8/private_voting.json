    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.4: Student Code of Conduct - The board will review proposed updates to the district\u2019s Student Code of Conduct, which outlines behavioral expectations and disciplinary procedures. Key changes include new rules around cell phone usage during instructional time, updates to the dress code to reflect inclusivity and professionalism, and revisions to disciplinary consequences to promote restorative practices.. Who would like to start?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thanks, Graham. Ellen, could you walk us through the updated cell phone policy? I think it\u2019s important we understand how it balances access with instruction. Maybe we should confirm whether teachers feel equipped to enforce it consistently."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "David, I'm not sure what the answer to that question is, but maybe we should talk to the staff or find out how they're feeling about enforcement. It seems pretty clear-cut, but I guess there might be some challenges."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Kate. I appreciate that. I do wonder\u2014how much feedback have we gotten from teachers so far on the cell phone policy? And maybe we could check in with them before finalizing anything."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thanks, Judi. I\u2019ve heard some positive things from teachers about the clarity of the new policy. But let me ask\u2014have any of you had direct conversations with teachers about enforcing it?  \n\nI\u2019d really like to know if they feel supported.  \n\nCould someone please reach out to a few principals and get their take on teacher readiness?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Thank you, Ellen. That sounds great. Could you please send a note to Dr. Potts asking her to help identify three principals to interview? I\u2019d love to hear from the ones who are already doing this work."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Yeah, I'll try to get something going here. Just want to point out that when we were discussing this last week, we did mention that we needed more information because the guidance document was still being worked on. So maybe just give me a second while I see if I can get that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Katrina, thanks. I think getting that info quickly makes sense. I wonder if we should also ask principals whether they\u2019re comfortable making decisions about phones without involving law enforcement. Probably worth checking."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Yeah, I don't know if we've asked that yet. I'd say let's go ahead and ask that too."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I would suggest we ask our legal counsel, maybe Ms. Smith, whether that would be an appropriate thing to ask. I mean, I assume it would be, but I don't know."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Kate. I agree\u2014we should probably check with legal first. Does anyone know if she\u2019ll be available next week? Maybe we could loop her in then."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Well, Judith, I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s available next week. I suppose we could call her and see."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Good point, Kate.  \nJudie, could you please check with Ms. Smith about whether we can safely ask principals about handling phones without involving police?  \nAnd yes, let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re aligned on what\u2019s permissible legally."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Yes, I would agree. And I think we all agree that the goal is to keep kids safe and secure in classrooms. And if we\u2019re able to do that, that would be great."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Yeah, I agree. I'm hoping that we can figure out how to do that. I know that some schools aren't using cameras right now, but hopefully once those come back online, that'll help."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "I hope so too, Katrina. I wonder if we should ask principals whether they feel confident managing classroom disruptions without calling SROs. Maybe that\u2019s another way to gauge comfort levels."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Okay, yeah, I'll add that to my list."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I think we need to ask our principals about that, David. I don't know offhand."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Sounds good, David. Would someone mind looping in the principals again later this week? I\u2019d really like to get a better sense of where folks stand."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Judi, could you please follow up with the principals about their confidence in managing disruptions without involving SROs?\nLet\u2019s get a clearer picture before we finalize anything."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Sure, Ellen. I\u2019ll check in with them. I\u2019m wondering though\u2014if we\u2019re asking about confidence, should we also get a sense of what kind of training or support they might need?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "I think that would be very helpful."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Yeah, I'd be interested in knowing that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Judi, I think it\u2019s smart to ask about training too. I wonder if we should consider offering optional workshops for principals on de-escalation techniques. Might help build confidence."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I think that would be useful, David. I don't know whether we could offer such a workshop at a certain time or whether we could do it virtually."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, David. I do think having options might be helpful. Maybe we could explore that with the PD team\u2014would it be possible to schedule a couple of sessions, even briefly?"
