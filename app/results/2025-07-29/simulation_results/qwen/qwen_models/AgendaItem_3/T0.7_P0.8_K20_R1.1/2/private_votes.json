    "comment": "Based on the discussion, I believe adopting the revised Student Code of Conduct\u2014especially with updated cell phone policies\u2014is necessary to promote student focus while being mindful of equity and educator burden.\n\nHowever, I also recognize concerns about implementation challenges and the importance of gathering feedback before full adoption. Given these considerations, I am choosing to abstain."
