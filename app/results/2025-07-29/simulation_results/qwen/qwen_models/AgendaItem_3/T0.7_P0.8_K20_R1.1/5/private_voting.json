    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.4: Student Code of Conduct - The board will review proposed updates to the district\u2019s Student Code of Conduct, which outlines behavioral expectations and disciplinary procedures. Key changes include new rules around cell phone usage during instructional time, updates to the dress code to reflect inclusivity and professionalism, and revisions to disciplinary consequences to promote restorative practices.. Who would like to start?"

  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thanks, Graham. I think it\u2019d be helpful to hear from Ellen first\u2014what do you see as the biggest challenge in getting kids to buy into this updated code?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thank you, David. Ellen, maybe we could talk just briefly about what kind of outreach we\u2019ve had to parents and students, because I suspect they\u2019re not exactly sure what these changes mean."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thanks, Kate. I think the biggest challenge is making sure students understand why these rules exist\u2014not just that there\u2019s a rule, but why it matters.  \n\nDo any of us have examples of how we've explained the purpose behind cell phone use to middle or high schoolers?  \n\nI know some principals have done cool things with student-led discussions. Maybe someone else tried something similar?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Ellen. I appreciate your framing.  \n\nMaybe we could start by asking each principal to share one specific way they\u2019ve helped students *understand* the \u201cwhy\u201d behind the cell phone policy?  \n\nI\u2019m curious\u2014do you think those methods actually shifted behavior, or was it mostly awareness?  \n\nAnd does anyone here have data showing whether those conversations improved compliance over time?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thanks, Judy. That\u2019s a great idea\u2014let\u2019s hear from the principals on how they\u2019ve framed the \u201cwhy.\u201d  \nDo any of you have anecdotal evidence that talking through the reasons made a difference in student behavior?  \nI wonder if we could track that across schools\u2014maybe a quick survey after those sessions?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Hi, everybody. Sorry I missed the beginning of the conversation. Could we go back to the last question? And I think I'm going to repeat it again, because I don't want to miss anything. Judi asked the principals if they have anecdotes where talking through the \"why\" has changed behavior. Is that correct?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Yes, Jon, that\u2019s right\u2014thank you for clarifying.\nCould we get at least two principals to share an example of when explaining the \u201cwhy\u201d led to better student buy-in?\nI\u2019d love to hear how they structured those conversations\u2014was it whole group, small groups, peer-led?\nAnd did they notice differences in engagement or discipline referrals afterward?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "So, Judith, can I take a stab at answering that question? I guess I'll try to answer it for my school. But I'd like to say, I agree with everything that you said. It really makes sense to me. \n\nSo, yes, I remember doing a presentation with my staff, and then we went out and talked to our eighth graders and seventh graders. And so, I didn't come up with it myself, but I liked the idea of using the analogy of, well, let's look at what happens when we're driving, okay, and you have your phone next to you, and then suddenly you need to reach down and grab it. You lose control of the vehicle. Okay, so we're trying to teach them that same thing. Like, if you're trying to learn something while looking at your phone, you're losing control of your brain. And then I saw the results of that. And I think it worked pretty well. \n\nSo I thought that was a good way to explain it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Katrina. That analogy really resonated\u2014I\u2019ll bet many students connected with that.\nDid you get feedback from students afterward? Did anyone say, \u201cOh, now I get it,\u201d or \u201cI used to do that, but I won\u2019t anymore\u201d?  \nAnd were there any noticeable shifts in classroom distractions or referrals following that session?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Katrina, I appreciate that story\u2014it\u2019s powerful.  \nHow did you gauge whether students truly internalized the message beyond just nodding along?  \nI wonder if a brief follow-up survey or check-in might help measure long-term impact.  \nWould you consider piloting that in your school next year?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Well, I am definitely willing to pilot it. I think it's worth checking out. Honestly, though, it felt like the majority of the students responded positively. They got it. It wasn't necessarily like, oh, I'm never touching my phone again. It was more like, oh, I see why that's important. I think it's a big shift."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Well, I think it sounds very effective. I wonder if we could, perhaps, have the principals report back to us at the end of the year on how successful they found the programs to be. Do we already have that information? Or should we ask for it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Kate. I agree\u2014we should collect that info.\nCan we please ask each principal to include a brief reflection on student buy-in and behavioral change in their annual report?\nAnd maybe add a simple survey item: \u201cAfter today\u2019s lesson, do you feel more prepared to make responsible choices about phones?\u201d\nLet\u2019s keep tracking that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thanks, Kate. I think that\u2019s a solid plan\u2014simple but meaningful.\nJudie, do you mind assigning one person to coordinate collecting those reflections and surveys from the principals?\nAlso, I wonder if we could pair that with a teacher feedback loop\u2014after all, they\u2019re the ones seeing the behaviors daily."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Thank you, Ellen. One other question. When we talk about this, I would hope that most of us will have a discussion with our kids before we implement this. I'm assuming that's true. But I do have a couple of questions. How much of this are we doing through social media announcements? And how much of it are we doing directly with the students? Because I think there's been times in the past when it seemed like some of the announcements were sent out via social media and the students weren't aware of them. Am I wrong about that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Yeah, no, I think that's totally fair. I mean, I know that I've seen emails go out to parents and I haven't seen them posted anywhere else. And I know sometimes it feels like things are getting lost. So I'm glad you brought that up."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Jon, I think you raise a valid point\u2014communication channels matter.\nMaybe we should clarify which platforms we use for different messages.\nWould someone please confirm: Are we relying too heavily on email and social media instead of direct classroom delivery?\nWe should ensure consistency between home and school messaging."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "I think that's great. Thank you, David. Let me just give a little bit of background here. There was a time when I had a situation happen with a student and I told her to send me a text. She looked at me kind of funny and she said, \"Well, Mr. Alcaro, I don't have a cell phone.\" And I was stunned. And I said, \"What?\" And she said, \"I don't have a cell phone.\" And I couldn't believe it. And I said, \"Why not?\" And she said, \"Because I don't need it. My mom doesn't allow it.\"\nAnd I was thinking to myself, wow, what a difference that is. And I was sitting there saying to myself, geez, I don't know how many times I've had a kid call me after hours or whatever. And I thought, boy, that's a lot of pressure for a parent to put on a child. And I certainly understand that there are reasons for these devices. But I just wanted to throw that out there. I don't know. Anybody else have thoughts on that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Well, I think that raises an interesting point, Jon. I think we want to be sensitive to the fact that not everyone has a device, nor does everyone want one. I suppose we could find ways to encourage, but I'd hate to penalize those who don't have them. Maybe we could work together to figure out how to deal with that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Jon, thank you for sharing that experience\u2014that moment really struck me.\nI wonder if we\u2019ve considered offering alternative ways to communicate with families who don\u2019t rely on texts or apps.\nCould we please assign someone to review communication methods across departments and recommend low-tech options where possible?\nAnd let\u2019s make sure those recommendations reflect real-life access\u2014not just assumptions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "That\u2019s such a thoughtful point, Jon. I\u2019m glad you shared that story.  \nJudie, could you please look into how many families actually receive communications via text or app?  \nAnd while you're at it, can we identify which families might be left out due to lack of access?  \nI\u2019d like to make sure we\u2019re not creating unintended barriers."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Okay, well, thank you. I appreciate that. And thank you, Ellen, for taking care of that because I think that's going to be a good thing."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Yeah, I guess I'm wondering though, like, so I don't know, is there anything we can do to help with that? Like, I don't know. Is there something that the district could offer?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Katriona, I hear your concern\u2014and I think it's important we acknowledge disparities without overreacting.\nDo we have data on how many families lack reliable access to smartphones or internet?\nIf not, could someone please pull that info by next month?\nAnd then, yes\u2014let\u2019s explore whether affordable options exist, or even pilot a program to provide basic devices to those in need.\nBut let\u2019s move carefully\u2014I don\u2019t want to assume need without evidence."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Well, David, I would say that we already have some very limited resources available to some extent. For instance, the technology department has some laptops, and I know that the transportation department has some buses with wi-fi. But I think perhaps we could take a look at that."
