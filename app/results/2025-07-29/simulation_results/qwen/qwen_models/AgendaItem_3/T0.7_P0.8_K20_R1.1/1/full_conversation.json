    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.4: Student Code of Conduct - The board will review proposed updates to the district\u2019s Student Code of Conduct, which outlines behavioral expectations and disciplinary procedures. Key changes include new rules around cell phone usage during instructional time, updates to the dress code to reflect inclusivity and professionalism, and revisions to disciplinary consequences to promote restorative practices.. Who would like to start?"

  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thanks, Graham. Ellen, could you walk us through the updated cell phone policy? I'm wondering how we'll enforce it without making it seem punitive. Maybe we could pilot it in one or two schools first?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thank you, David. I agree with you. I think there's been some pushback already from parents who feel they're being asked to police their children's phones at home. I wonder what kind of evidence we have that having no phones actually improves learning."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Kate. I appreciate those points.  \nI\u2019m curious\u2014how do we know this won\u2019t just shift stress onto families, especially those already stretched thin?  \nMaybe we could test it in a few schools before rolling it out district-wide.  \nWhat data do we have showing that banning phones increases engagement or academic performance?  \nCould we get feedback from students too, since they\u2019re the ones most affected?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thanks, Dave. I think starting with a pilot makes sense.  \nDo any of the principals think they\u2019d be willing to try it in one building next semester?  \nWe\u2019ve seen some promising results in other districts\u2014maybe we could look at that data.  \nWould it help to give parents a clear explanation of why we\u2019re doing this?  \nKate, did you say you wanted to talk more about the parent pushback?  \nJudyl, yes\u2014I think getting student feedback is key.  \nShould we survey students at different grade levels before finalizing it?"

  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Good morning, everybody. Thank you all for the comments. And I want to thank Ms. Osborne and her team for putting together these proposals. I thought it was great. I think there's a lot of good stuff in here. I guess my question is where does this fit into our priorities right now? Is this something that we're going to take up again later in the year when things settle down a little bit? Or is this something we're ready to move forward with? Because I've got a couple of thoughts that I've had. One has to do with discipline. But maybe I'll save that until after the break."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thanks so much, Mr. Alcaro. I don't think I'd be able to answer that question specifically. So I guess I can speak generally and say that I am excited to see some movement toward addressing the issue of cell phone use in schools because I do believe that it's disruptive. I do believe that it takes away from instruction, particularly for younger students. That said, I would love to hear back from someone about whether or not there's data that shows that restricting phone use leads to better outcomes for students. It seems logical, but I'd love to know if anyone else has done research on that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Katrin, I appreciate your point. I think we might need to gather some data before moving forward. Maybe we could ask Dr. Lujan to look into studies from other districts? Do you think that's feasible?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I definitely think that's feasible. I mean, I would hope that he knows somebody who could help him find that information."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thank you, David. I do think that we should look at the data. I wonder, though, whether the real problem isn't necessarily cell phones themselves, but rather social media, which is accessible via cell phones. I think it's important that we consider how best to handle that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Kate. I appreciate that insight.\nI wonder\u2014do we have any idea how many kids actually use phones for social media during class?\nMaybe we could check in with teachers and see what they\u2019re observing.\nIf it\u2019s mostly social media, perhaps we should focus on content access instead of device bans.\nCan we get some data on that, please?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thanks, Jonno. I think we could revisit this after summer.\nDoes anyone think it\u2019s urgent enough to act now?\nKate, I agree\u2014social media might be the bigger concern.\nJennifer, do you know if we\u2019ve tracked how often phones come up during lessons?\nAnd Judyl, I second your question\u2014are teachers seeing a pattern with social media?\nLet\u2019s pull in some teacher feedback before deciding.\nDr. Lujan, could you help us find examples from other districts where this worked well?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Okay, sounds good. I really appreciate that. I guess my last comment is just I understand that it's hard to track exactly how many times students bring their phones to school. But I think that tracking it over a period of time, even informally, might be helpful. And then once we have a baseline, then we can determine whether or not it needs to be addressed."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Yes, I completely agree. I think collecting data is extremely important. I'm hoping that we will collect data around student behavior and make sure that we're not just creating another thing that's unfair for certain populations of students."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Katrin, I agree. We must avoid unintended consequences. Let\u2019s assign Dr. Lujan to collect behavioral data across grades. Please confirm by Friday."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Sounds good."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I wonder whether it wouldn't be better to work with the students directly on this. They're certainly very tech-savvy. I think it would be worth considering asking them how they feel about using their devices during instructional time."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Kate, I appreciate that suggestion.  \nHave we considered doing a student survey on this?  \nI think involving them directly could help shape fairer rules.  \nPlease, let\u2019s assign someone to draft that survey.  \nHow soon can we expect it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Judyl, I think it would be helpful to get input from students. Perhaps we could start with an informal discussion among staff and then expand. I wonder whether we should go ahead and put a version of the revised dress code out for review."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Judyl, yes\u2014let\u2019s do a quick student survey next week.\nCould you coordinate with counselors to reach out to homerooms?\nKatrin, I\u2019d like to keep equity top of mind\u2014let\u2019s make sure no group feels left out.\nDavid, please check in with Dr. Lujan on the behavioral data timeline.\nKate, I agree\u2014we should involve students early.\nDo you think middle schoolers would respond well to a poll?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Well, I think that's a great idea. And I think it makes sense to try it first in middle school. I'm not quite sure that high school students would be too interested in responding to a survey. But I think it makes perfect sense to do it with middle schoolers."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Yeah, I think that's a great idea. I mean, I was thinking about this earlier when we were talking about how difficult it is to measure these things. I think having a student opinion survey might give us a lot more clarity than trying to count how many times students brought their phones to school."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Katrin, I agree. Let's proceed with the middle school survey. Please confirm with Dr. Lujan by Monday."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Sounds good."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I wonder whether we should include students' views on dress codes as well."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Kate, I agree\u2014students\u2019 voices matter here too.\nWouldn\u2019t it be helpful to test both surveys together?\nI think we could learn a lot from combining those inputs.\nPlease, assign someone to draft that dress code survey.\nWhen can we expect it?"
