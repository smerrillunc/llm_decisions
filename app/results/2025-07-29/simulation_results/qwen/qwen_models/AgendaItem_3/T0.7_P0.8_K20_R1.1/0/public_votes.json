    "comment": "We're not going to move forward with this motion because we didn't get three affirmative votes. So it was moved by Mr. Alcaro, seconded by Dr. Johnson, that we accept the recommendations from the committee regarding curriculum adoption and implementation for next year. It was brought up by Mrs. Osborne, but she said that there was still some confusion about the process. And so if there's any other questions or comments on the motion, please bring them up now. Otherwise, I'll call the roll."
