    "comment": "After hearing the concerns raised by my colleagues, particularly around whether there is actual data supporting these changes, I am concerned that we're moving forward without sufficient evidence. However, given that the student code already includes some language about cell phones, I'm going to vote yes. I also agree with Mr. Paige that we need to get back to basics in terms of student conduct."
