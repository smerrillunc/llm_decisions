    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.4: Student Code of Conduct - The board will review proposed updates to the district\u2019s Student Code of Conduct, which outlines behavioral expectations and disciplinary procedures. Key changes include new rules around cell phone usage during instructional time, updates to the dress code to reflect inclusivity and professionalism, and revisions to disciplinary consequences to promote restorative practices.. Who would like to start?"

  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thanks, Graham.  \n\nI\u2019ve reviewed the draft, and it looks thoughtful\u2014especially the emphasis on restorative practices.  \n\nEllen, what are your thoughts on how we\u2019ll enforce the updated cell phone policy without overburdening teachers?  \n\nKate, since you\u2019re leading the equity work, does the revised dress code strike the right balance between professionalism and inclusion?  \n\nJon, given your experience, do you think the consequences section gives principals enough discretion to respond appropriately?  \n\nKathy, I know you\u2019ve been involved\u2014how do we make sure the changes actually reach families who need them most?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thank you, David.\n\nI think it's important that we have a consistent message across all our communications, whether they're electronic or printed.\n\nWe'll have to look at ways to get information out to parents, maybe even host a couple of parent meetings. \n\nI'd appreciate hearing more about the impact of cell phones on instruction."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Kate.\n\nI appreciate the consistency point\u2014do you think we could pilot something like a multilingual flyer?  \nMaybe check in with family liaisons too?\n\nDavid, I agree with your points on restorative practices\u2014I wonder if there\u2019s room to add clarity on when those apply versus traditional discipline.  \n\nAnd Ellen, do you see any real challenges in enforcing the cell phone rule across different grade levels?  \nI\u2019m thinking especially about younger kids who might still be developing self-regulation skills."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thanks, Judith.\n\nI think the cell phone rule makes sense, but enforcement could vary widely by teacher and classroom. Do you think we should offer training or guidance on managing devices consistently? \n\nAlso, younger kids definitely need extra support\u2014should we consider age-appropriate strategies instead of one-size-fits-all limits?\n\nWould you mind checking with the elementary teams to see what kind of help they\u2019d want?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Well, first off, thank you all for doing this. This has taken a lot of time and energy. And I really appreciate the thoughtfulness behind it.\n\nJudith, I'm glad you asked about the flyers. Could we possibly use some of our existing social media platforms? I think that would reach a broader group.\n\nOne thing I'd love to hear more about is what happens if a student doesn't comply with the cell phone rule after being warned once?\n\nIs there a consequence beyond just taking away the device?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Hi Jon, thank you so much for those great ideas. So, I guess my next question would be, can we set up a system where teachers can report these things and then we can track trends? Because I think it'd be helpful to know if certain schools are struggling or having success. I mean, I don't know if we can do that easily. But yeah, maybe we could figure that out."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Judith, thank you for raising that\u2014it's a great question.\nI think we should clarify when restorative practices apply versus traditional discipline, maybe even build a flowchart into the handbook.\nKate, would you mind assigning someone to draft a multilingual flyer, perhaps with input from family liaisons?\nEllen, I agree\u2014we should provide guidance or training, not just expect uniformity.\nDo you think a brief video tutorial for teachers might help, or would written materials suffice?\nJon, using social media seems promising\u2014but let's confirm with Communications whether it aligns with current protocols.\nKatrina, tracking compliance data sounds useful, though we should be careful not to burden teachers with reporting.\nCould we test that idea with a small group of schools first?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Yes, I think a flyer would be very good, Judith.\nAnd I think we need to keep talking about the cell phone policy because I worry that young children might not be able to regulate themselves.\nI think we ought to have some sort of strategy for how to deal with that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Kate.\nI think we should loop in the elementary team leaders\u2014they might have insights on developmentally appropriate approaches.\nEllen, do you think a short training module would be feasible, maybe built into orientation or PD days?\nAnd Jon, I agree about piloting the tracking idea\u2014could we pick two schools with different demographics to test it?\nKatrina, please send that idea to Communications and see if they\u2019re open to a trial.\nAlso, before we finalize anything, can we double-check that the revised dress code doesn\u2019t unintentionally penalize gender-nonconforming students?\nThat\u2019s a big concern for me."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Judith, yes, a short training module would be helpful\u2014let\u2019s schedule one during PD days.  \nDo you think we could involve some veteran teachers to co-create it?  \nKate, I second the concern about younger kids\u2014can we get input from early childhood specialists on handling phone use developmentally?  \nJon, piloting with two diverse schools sounds smart\u2014please coordinate with Communications on logistics."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Okay, Judith, thank you again for bringing that up. That's exactly why I was asking about the flyer. You know, it strikes me that if we're going to be sending messages out through social media, we better be prepared to answer questions. \nSo, I hope that's okay. And I think that will go well. \nBut I do think we need to be clear about what the expectations are. And I think we've got a long way to go. And I think we've got a long way to go in terms of making sure that the rules are understood and enforced."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Jon.\nI agree\u2014we\u2019ve got to make sure messaging is both clear and reachable.\nCan we assign someone to draft sample Q&A content for FAQs, maybe based on common concerns from last year?\nAnd Ellen, I\u2019d love to hear more about how early childhood experts might shape that training.\nKate, do you think we could pull together a quick survey for families and staff to gauge readiness?\nIt might take five minutes max\u2014just to check alignment before rollout."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Judith, I think that's a great point. I'm wondering, do we have enough information right now to determine what the best practice is? Maybe we could talk to the principals and find out what they're already doing. I mean, I feel like it's important to give them the autonomy to come up with something that works."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Katrina, that\u2019s a fair point\u2014I wonder if we could gather those examples quickly, maybe via a brief survey to principals?\nEllen, do you think we could pull a few case studies from classrooms that\u2019ve had success with phone management?\nAnd Jon, since you mentioned clarity, could we ask Legal to review the FAQ draft for consistency with current policies?\nJust to make sure we\u2019re not opening any loopholes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Judith, thank you for highlighting that\u2014those gaps matter.\nI think we should clarify who handles enforcement at each level\u2014principals vs. teachers\u2014to avoid confusion.\nKate, would you please draft a simple survey for parents and staff, checking awareness and comfort levels with the new phone policy?\nEllen, I think pulling real classroom examples makes sense\u2014can we identify three strong cases by Friday?\nJon, I agree\u2014Legal should vet the FAQ content. Please loop them in today.\nKatrina, I\u2019d suggest including a question about preferred communication channels\u2014social media, email, etc.\u2014to inform outreach.\nJudith, I\u2019m concerned about unintended consequences\u2014do we have a plan to monitor outcomes post-implementation?\nWould it be possible to establish a feedback mechanism, say, monthly updates from site leads?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thank you, David. I'd like to try to move forward on these issues but I think we need to look at our budget implications."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Kate, absolutely\u2014budget impacts are critical.  \nPlease circulate a preliminary cost estimate for the proposed training modules and flyers by next week.  \nI think we should also assess whether any existing funds can absorb the load without affecting other priorities.  \nJudith, does Facilities have capacity to support additional signage or tech resources?  \nJon, could you check if there\u2019s funding available in the upcoming budget cycle for pilot testing?  \nKatrina, I\u2019ll defer to your judgment on staffing, but please flag any red flags early."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "David, thanks for pushing on that\u2014it\u2019s essential we track impact.\nKate, I think we should hold off on full rollout until we have those estimates\u2014otherwise we risk overcommitting.\nJon, could you confirm with Finance whether the pilot costs are covered under existing allocations?\nAnd Kat, when you draft the survey, please include a line about resource access\u2014especially for low-income families.\nDavid, just to be safe, can Facilities confirm if they can handle extra signage without stretching thin?\nAnd Kate, let\u2019s meet briefly after the meeting to walk through projected costs\u2014you\u2019ve got the most experience with that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Judith, I really appreciate your emphasis on clear messaging\u2014how can we make sure it reaches everyone, especially families who don\u2019t check email regularly?  \nJon, could you help us figure out which groups might miss the social media posts?  \nKate, please check with Facilities\u2014is there room for more signs without adding stress?  \nJudith, I think we should definitely gather those principal examples\u2014can we get three by Thursday so we can build on good practices?  \nDavid, I trust your instinct on holding back\u2014but can we still start small, like sharing tips with staff this week?  \nKatrina, do you think we can add a quick question to the parent survey about access to devices at home?  \nAnd Ellen, please remind me\u2014what did we decide about involving teachers in designing the training?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Yes, I think that's very helpful. So I guess we'll be looking at the surveys and the training materials, and I think we'll be ready to roll on that soon. And I think that's very exciting because I think it helps kids learn how to manage their phones appropriately. And I think it gives them a chance to see what happens when they break the rules."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "I think it's going to be hard to reach everyone though. I know my son doesn't always read his emails. So I don't know if we're reaching everybody. I guess I would want to know where else we're sending the messages."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Jon, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I think we need to temper it with caution.\nLet\u2019s keep the rollout phased\u2014don\u2019t assume universal readiness yet.\nJudith, yes\u2014let\u2019s verify Facilities\u2019 bandwidth before committing to more signage.\nEllen, I\u2019d like to hear your thoughts on teacher involvement\u2014are we asking for buy-in or demanding compliance?\nKatrina, I think we should consider text alerts or even paper handouts for non-email users.\nKate, please confirm with Facilities if space permits\u2014then we can proceed safely.\nJudith, I agree\u2014tracking impact is key. Can we schedule a mid-year check-in to assess progress?\nJon, will Legal also sign off on the final version before distribution?\nI think we\u2019re getting close, but I\u2019d rather move slowly than rush into problems."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Well, I mean, Judith has raised an excellent point. I'm not certain that we've considered the potential impact of having multiple sets of guidelines for different grades."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Kate, that\u2019s a solid point\u2014I wonder if we\u2019ve thought about grade-level differences in device use.\nDavid, do you think we should tailor guidance per K\u20135 vs. middle vs. high? Might simplify things.\nEllen, could you ask principals if they\u2019ve noticed patterns across grades?\nJon, can you flag any legal risks in tiered approaches?\nKatrina, maybe we could test a simplified message format first\u2014see how well it lands?\nJudith, I\u2019m curious\u2014have you seen evidence of younger kids struggling more with self-regulation around phones?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Judyle, I think you\u2019re right\u2014we should find out if younger kids really do struggle more with phone use.  \nCan you ask the principals to share what they\u2019ve observed, please?  \nJon, do you think there\u2019s a risk in giving different rules to each grade level?  \nKatrina, wouldn\u2019t it be easier if we tested one simple message first instead of juggling several versions?  \nJudith, do you think we\u2019re missing something big here\u2014like how much screen time affects attention spans?  \nDavid, should we wait until we hear from the principals before tweaking the wording?  \nKate, I wonder if we\u2019re overlooking how busy teachers already are with new policies.  \nMaybe we could pilot this with just two schools first?"
