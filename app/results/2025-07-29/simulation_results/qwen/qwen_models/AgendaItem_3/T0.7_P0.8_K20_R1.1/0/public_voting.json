    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.4: Student Code of Conduct - The board will review proposed updates to the district\u2019s Student Code of Conduct, which outlines behavioral expectations and disciplinary procedures. Key changes include new rules around cell phone usage during instructional time, updates to the dress code to reflect inclusivity and professionalism, and revisions to disciplinary consequences to promote restorative practices.. Who would like to start?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thanks, Graham. I appreciate the overview.\n\nI\u2019m wondering, Ellen, how do you see the updated cell phone policy balancing student access with classroom instruction?\n\nAnd Kate, could you clarify what \u201cprofessionalism\u201d means in the revised dress code\u2014how will it be defined or enforced?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thank you, David.\n\nEllen, maybe we could talk a little bit more about cell phones. I know there was a recent survey of parents. I wonder if they felt like the current rule was effective or whether they thought something needed to change. \n\nAnd, yes, I guess my question is, how do we define \"professionalism\" in the dress code? I mean, I'm not sure exactly what we're trying to achieve here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, David, Kate.\n\nEllen, I\u2019d love to hear more about those parent survey results. Do you think most parents feel confident about how cell phones are managed now?\n\nKate, I agree\u2014\u201cprofessionalism\u201d feels vague. Could we get examples of what that looks like in practice?\n\nAlso, does anyone know how many staff members actually enforce the dress code currently?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thanks, David.  \nI think the cell phone policy aims to reduce distractions while still allowing access when needed.  \nMaybe we could check in with teachers\u2014are they seeing improvements since the last update?  \n\nKate, I don\u2019t have the full survey data yet\u2014but I\u2019d like to learn more.  \nWould you mind sending me the results so we can look at them together?  \n\nJudyle, good point\u2014I haven\u2019t seen enforcement stats either.  \nCan someone pull that information before next week?  \n\nDo any of us remember how often the dress code comes up in discipline reports?  \nWe should consider how much attention it gets compared to other policies."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Thanks, Ellen. Good points.\n\nDavid, maybe we could ask Ms. McLeod to join us briefly today?\n\nMs. McLeod, would you please come forward and introduce yourself?\n\nThank you very much. And I hope that we\u2019ll get her back again soon."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thanks, Jonno. I appreciate you bringing her in.\n\nSo just a quick question for Ms. McLeod, I know you were involved in developing these policies, right?\n\nWhat are some of the biggest concerns you've heard from students, particularly high-risk students, around cell phone use and dress codes?\n\nI'd also be curious to know, because I know there's been some pushback from different communities on both sides of the issue, especially with the dress code, where some folks say it's too lenient, others say it's too restrictive. \n\nBut I guess my bigger concern is making sure that our policies aren't creating barriers for our high-risk students. So I'd be interested in hearing from you specifically, Ms. McLeod, on that front."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thank you, Katrina.\n\nKatrina, I appreciate your emphasis on student well-being. \n\nJonno, could you help me understand why we\u2019re bringing in external consultants now instead of relying on internal expertise?\n\nJulie, do you think our current policies already account for high-risk students\u2019 needs?\n\nEllen, has the data shown any correlation between cell phone use and academic performance?\n\nKate, how do we balance parental concerns with student autonomy?\n\nGraham, do we have benchmarks for evaluating the success of these new policies?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Well, I am concerned about equity and fairness.\nI mean, if some kids have cell phones and others don't, then requiring that they turn them in seems unfair.\nHow do we deal with that?\nAnd secondly, I guess I'm thinking about how do we define professional dress? Is it jeans versus slacks? Are we getting into issues of gender identity or nonbinary identity? That's an area that I don't really know anything about."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Katrina.  \nEllen, could you share how many incidents related to cell phones happened last year?  \nKate, I think your point about access matters\u2014if we require turning them in, but some families can\u2019t afford replacements, that\u2019s a real barrier.  \nCould we get data on how many devices are missing after school?  \nAnd Katrinacallsen, I agree\u2014we should make sure these policies don\u2019t disproportionately affect high-risk students.  \nJulie, do we have any evidence that suspensions for dress code violations impact attendance or graduation rates?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thanks, Jonno.\nI'll check with Ms. McLeod about student concerns\u2014especially around accessibility.\nJulie, let me pull the incident numbers for you\u2014can you confirm the timeframe?\nKate, great point about equity\u2014those without phones shouldn\u2019t face penalties.\nLet\u2019s find out how many students report losing theirs.\nIf we don\u2019t have data, maybe we ask principals to track it next semester.\nJulie, do you think we\u2019ve looked at attendance patterns linked to dress code issues?\nI worry that stricter rules might push some students away.\nKatrina, I agree\u2014let\u2019s keep an eye on how these changes affect vulnerable groups.\nPlease, can someone gather baseline stats before the vote?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Great thoughts all around.\nEllen, thank you for being so proactive and responsive.\nJulie, did you want to weigh in on the number of incidents involving cell phones last year?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Sorry, Julie, I missed your answer earlier.\nWhen you said it was low, though, how low is low? Like, I'm guessing it's less than ten, right?\nBecause I'm kind of wondering how much of a problem it actually is.\nAnd then I guess following up on that, if it's low, how are we going to measure success of the new policies?\nBecause if we start off with zero or near-zero, then no matter what happens, it's hard to tell if things got better or worse.\nSo I guess, Dave, maybe you can give me a ballpark estimate of how many times it came up last year?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thank you, Katrina.\nKatrina, I think your concern about measuring success is valid\u2014probably not enough data exists currently.\nJulie, do you recall the exact number of reported incidents last year?\nGraham, could we establish metrics for future evaluation?\nKate, would it help to standardize reporting across schools?\nEllen, does anyone else have insights on student feedback regarding cell phones?\nI wonder if we should collect anecdotal evidence from teachers as well."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "You know, I don't think we need to standardize the reporting quite yet.\nI think it's more important that we get some data on whether or not students who lose their phones, either accidentally or intentionally, are able to replace them.\nI mean, I assume most of them will, but I wouldn't be surprised if some couldn't.\nI don't know what the cost is of replacing a phone.\nIt could be pretty significant, even $100, maybe higher.\nThat's something I would hate to see happen to a family who doesn't have those resources.\nI guess my thought is that unless we're prepared to provide replacement phones for students who lose them, we ought to reconsider the policy."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Kate, I appreciate your caution\u2014I\u2019d like to hear how many families actually report loss or damage each year.  \nDo we have any estimates, Ellen?  \nMaybe we could survey a few schools just to gauge frequency.  \nGraham, could we look at how many phones were lost over the past three years?  \nAnd Katrinacallsen, I agree\u2014it might be worth considering alternatives, like secure storage.  \nDave, do we know how many families qualify for free lunch? Because that might help us assess risk.  \nWouldn\u2019t it be fairer to offer loaners rather than demand full replacement?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thanks, Julie, for pulling those numbers\u2014yes, six incidents last year.\n\nKate, good call on checking replacement costs\u2014let\u2019s flag that for finance.\n\nJulie, can you ask principals to log losses by grade level?\n\nGraham, please draft a simple form for tracking\u2014just dates and reasons.\n\nKate, yes\u2014loaners sound smart; let\u2019s explore that option.\n\nJudith, do we know how many students had phones confiscated for other reasons?\n\nDave, can we cross-reference FRL counts with device reports?\n\nEllen, have we heard from parents about the policy change?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Judith, thank you for doing that work.\nAnd Ellen, thank you for asking that question because I think that's very important.\nAnd I've been told there are two ways to go here.\nOne is that the school divisions can take the money from the general fund and pay for those phones.\nBut I believe they also can use Title IV funds.\nNow, I'm not certain which way we're going to go, but I think we need to figure that out soon.\nIs that correct, Ellen?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Yeah, I'm trying to imagine how common it is for a kid to lose a phone.\nI mean, I've never done it myself, but I feel like when I was younger, I didn't lose mine too often.\nI don't know if kids today are different.\nI guess I'm just curious how many times it happened last year.\nSix seems really low.\nI'd love to know how many phones are actually lost per school.\nLike, is it happening once a month or once a year?\nBecause I guess it's possible that if it's rare, then the penalty isn't bad.\nBut if it's happening multiple times a week, then yeah, I'd say that's a problem.\nSo, Ellen, maybe we could put together a quick email to send out to the principals asking them how many times this has come up since the beginning of the school year?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "That makes sense, Katrina.\nEllen, could you reach out to principals and request incident logs by school?\nGraham, please draft a brief template for consistency.\nJulie, would you mind confirming if the 6 cases included both intentional and accidental losses?\nKate, do you think loaners could be managed via the library program?\nJudith, I\u2019m concerned about unintended consequences\u2014if we don\u2019t plan for replacements, families may suffer unfairly.\nLet\u2019s check Title IV eligibility before finalizing anything.\nCould we schedule a quick review next week to confirm funding pathways?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Well, I mean, I would hope that the library program would be willing to lend out phones, but I suppose that would require a budget allocation to purchase additional phones, and I'm not sure where that would come from.\nWe did talk earlier about possibly having the school division buy them, but again, that would require an appropriation somewhere.\nI guess I'm thinking that perhaps we could try to set aside some money for that purpose.\nAnd maybe we could look into getting grants, although I suspect that would be difficult.\nI don't know. It sounds like it might be worthwhile to consider that possibility."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Judith, I appreciate your point\u2014families shouldn\u2019t bear the burden alone.  \nDo we know how many of those six incidents involved devices that were unrecoverable?  \nDave, could we estimate the median household income among affected families?  \nJudith, I wonder if Title IV covers tech access for lower-income students.  \nGraham, would you draft a note to finance about that?  \nKatrina, do you think we could pilot loaners in one school first?  \nEllen, could we track how many families requested replacements after confiscation?  \nPlease keep me posted\u2014this feels urgent."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thanks, Julie\u2014yes, we\u2019ll get those logs sorted.  \nDave, can you pull median income data for families with confiscated devices?  \nGraham, please draft a title IV question for finance\u2014quickly.  \nKatrina, pilot loaners sounds reasonable\u2014start with one middle school.  \nEllen, gather principal reports on loss types\u2014accidental vs. intentional.  \nKate, let\u2019s list grant options\u2014library phone funding could fit some.  \nJulie, monitor requests\u2014track whether families asked for replacements.  \nEllen, loop back with us by Friday\u2014don\u2019t wait."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "And, Dave, I think I'll have to leave that to someone else.\nI think it would be helpful to hear what kind of cost we're looking at for these phones.\nAnd I think that will give us something to chew on as well.\nI think that's all I have for now."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "So I guess I'm wondering who's responsible for replacing these phones?\nAre schools supposed to replace them themselves?\nOr does the district handle it?\nI guess I'm not clear on whose responsibility it is.\nI guess I'm also curious, though, like why would we want to punish kids so severely for losing things?\nI mean, like, I understand they're expensive, but I don't know\u2014I guess I'm not super convinced that taking away a kid's phone is gonna make them more careful.\nMaybe that's just me being old-fashioned, but I don't know.\nSo I guess my main concern is that we don't end up punishing kids disproportionately for losing items, especially if it's a small number of kids.\nSo I guess I'm hoping that we can find a solution that doesn't involve removing a kid's phone entirely."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "That's fair, Katrina.\nEllen, could you clarify ownership protocols\u2014are phones district property or student-owned?\nIf student-owned, who bears replacement cost?\nGraham, please draft a memo to legal on liability implications.\nJulie, would you survey parents on preferred alternatives to confiscation?\nKate, can we identify potential vendors for bulk purchases under $100 each?\nJudith, do you foresee financial hardship impacting compliance?\nKatherine, do you think a \"lost device\" fee could deter negligence without penalizing poverty?\nI agree\u2014we must balance accountability with compassion.\nPerhaps we could offer delayed return instead of permanent removal?\nWould that work better?"
