    "content": "Welcome everyone. Let's begin discussion on: Agenda Item No. 3.4: Student Code of Conduct - The board will review proposed updates to the district\u2019s Student Code of Conduct, which outlines behavioral expectations and disciplinary procedures. Key changes include new rules around cell phone usage during instructional time, updates to the dress code to reflect inclusivity and professionalism, and revisions to disciplinary consequences to promote restorative practices.. Who would like to start?"

    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thanks, Graham.  \n\nI\u2019ve reviewed the draft, and it seems pretty comprehensive.  \n\nEllen, did you get a chance to look at the updated cell phone policy?  \nIt might help us understand how it balances access with classroom focus.  \n\nKatrina, could you clarify how the new dress code ensures both inclusivity and professional standards?  \n\nJon, what\u2019s your take on the shift toward restorative practices\u2014does it align with what you\u2019re seeing in classrooms?  \n\nKate, does this feel manageable for teachers to implement consistently?  \n\nJudie, anything stand out to you as particularly impactful or concerning?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Thank you, David.\n\nI guess I'm wondering whether we need to make sure that the implementation of these changes doesn't fall too heavily on teachers' shoulders.\n\nAnd maybe we could talk more about how much additional training they'll need to carry them out effectively."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Kate.\n\nI agree\u2014we need to be mindful of teacher capacity.  \n\nDavid, could you say more about the anticipated workload for staff?  \n\nI\u2019m concerned about consistency across buildings.  \n\nMaybe we could hear from someone who works directly with teachers on this?  \n\nJudie, do you have thoughts on how we balance clarity with flexibility in enforcement?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thanks, Judie.  \n\nYes, David, I\u2019d love to know\u2014how many hours of PD do you anticipate teachers needing for this rollout?  \n\nI wonder if we\u2019ll see similar results to when we piloted restorative practices last year.  \n\nCould someone confirm whether principals will receive guidance on consistent application across schools?  \n\nJudie, how do you suggest we handle cases where parents push back on new policies?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Yes, thank you all very much. \n\nSo, first off, I want to acknowledge that there's been a lot of work here.\n\nDavid, I was just going to ask you, what's your sense of how long this has taken?\n\nBut then secondly, I really liked what Ellen said earlier today about the idea of using the existing framework, because I thought that made a lot of sense. \n\nNow, I've got to ask, Judie, since I didn't catch it before, why don't we start with asking Dr. Jones, who has done a great job working with our team, if she wants to comment on any of the things that were raised here, including her own perspective on the amount of training needed for teachers."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thanks, Jon, for those comments.\n\nI guess my main concern is making sure that we're being intentional about implementing something so significant without having enough information available to evaluate its impact.\n\nDavid, can you tell me what research you used to develop the cell phone policy?\n\nI'd also like to hear from the principal on the ground, specifically on how difficult it might be to enforce.\n\nIs there a plan to roll out the policy over multiple years?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thanks, Katrina.\nThat\u2019s a fair point\u2014I think we probably need more data before finalizing it.\nI\u2019m not certain what specific studies informed the cell phone rule; maybe we can check with HR later.\nGraham, could you follow up with Human Resources on that?\nJudie, I agree\u2014the pilot program last year showed mixed results.\nWe should probably assess outcomes after each phase.\nGraham, should we consider phasing in the full policy over two years?\nIf so, how do we track progress?\nJon, do you think Dr. Jones should present her findings next week?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I mean, I think we ought to hear from Dr. Jones, but I would hope that we wouldn't wait until next week.\nI mean, given that we are talking about an enormous change in practice, I think we ought to try to find out what we can about the impacts of the previous pilots, right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Kate.\nI appreciate your urgency.\nDavid, could we please get a timeline for rolling out the training?\nI\u2019m concerned about readiness across schools.\nJon, do you think Dr. Jones could join us sooner than next week?\nAlso, Kat, did you have feedback on how we\u2019ll monitor compliance?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thanks, Judie.\nDavid, could you please confirm if training materials will be ready by mid-September?\nI\u2019d hate for teachers to go into classrooms unprepared.\nJon, do you think Dr. Jones could send us a brief summary ahead of time?\nKatrina, how confident are you that we\u2019ll gather meaningful feedback from principals after Phase One?\nJudie, what kind of reporting structure do you envision for tracking compliance?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Yes, thank you, Ellen, and thank you, Judie.\nI was actually thinking, Judie, that we had agreed upon some sort of survey tool for the principals to use in terms of getting feedback.\nWould that still be happening, though?\nAnd if so, is that going to happen before this committee meets again?\nBecause I think we really need to hear from the principals on this subject.\nAnd, yes, thank you, Katrina, for bringing that up.\nThank you, David, for saying that you would check with HR.\nI think that's a good idea.\nAnd, Kate, I certainly agree with you that we ought to hear from Dr. Jones soon rather than later.\nAnd I think I would vote for her joining us tomorrow night instead of waiting until next week."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Thanks, Jon, for that suggestion.\nI'm happy to hear that we're trying to bring her in early.\nJudie, I'm curious, do you think we need to look at how this might affect kids differently based on race, gender, or socioeconomic status?\nI'm hoping that we're doing some equity analysis prior to moving forward.\nI know that we're already considering different approaches, but I'd love to hear more about the equity lens that we're applying to this.\nkatrinacallsen: And while I'm at it, David, can you explain how you're balancing the desire to reduce distractions with the potential benefits of phones for classroom instruction?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Thank you, Katrina.\nThat\u2019s a thoughtful question\u2014probably worth exploring further.\nI think we\u2019re trying to strike a balance between minimizing disruptions and allowing appropriate tech use.\nJudie, do you think we need a separate review group focused on equity implications?\nMaybe we could form a subcommittee with principals and teachers?\nGraham, could you help draft a request to Dr. Jones for a briefing by Thursday?\nEllen, do you think the current timeline allows enough prep time for principals?\nKatrina, I think the answer depends on whether devices enhance learning or distract from it.\nDo you think most teachers believe phones help or hinder instruction?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "Well, I think we all know that they can be helpful tools, but they can also be distracting tools, and it's very hard to manage.\nSo I think the real challenge is how do we train teachers to distinguish between the two?\nI mean, I think that's the key, isn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Kate.\nI agree\u2014we need clear guidance.\nJudie, I wonder if we could hold off on final decisions until we\u2019ve heard from Dr. Jones and seen the pilot data?\nI think we need to make sure we\u2019re protecting equity.\nDavid, could you please let us know what evidence supports the proposed changes?\nJudie, do you think we should require teacher input before adopting new rules?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Thanks, Judie.\nDavid, could you please confirm when we'll receive the HR research on cell phone policies?\nKate, I wonder if we should involve teachers earlier in shaping these guidelines\u2014do you think that's feasible?\nJudie, do you think principals will need extra support to implement this fairly across schools?\nKatrina, how do you suggest we measure whether the policy helps or hurts equity?\nJon, could Dr. Jones possibly give us a 10-minute update during tonight\u2019s meeting?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "That sounds great, Ellen.\nI think that would be wonderful.\nAnd, Judie, thank you for raising the issue of fairness.\nAnd I think, as we move through this, I think it's important that we keep in mind both the equity piece and also the fact that we don't want to add additional burdens to our teachers.\nAnd I think that's something that I've been hearing a lot about from other folks, too.\nAnd I think, you know, just because there's a lot of work involved doesn't necessarily mean that it's worthwhile.\njonnoalcaro: So I think we have to be careful in terms of where we put our efforts and how much burden we place on our faculty and our administrators."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Yeah, Jon, I agree with you.\nI guess my concern is, especially now, with everything else that's going on right now, adding another thing onto teachers' plates might be difficult.\nBut I guess I feel like maybe we need to start somewhere.\nkatrinacallsen: Do you guys see anything wrong with starting small, perhaps having them come back once per week and seeing how that goes?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Katrina, I appreciate that thought\u2014it might ease the transition.\nJudie, do you think piloting weekly phone access would be manageable for schools?\nGraham, could you reach out to Dr. Jones and see if she can join us tonight?\nKate, I think training teachers to assess intent behind device use makes sense\u2014but who should deliver that training?\nEllen, do you think we should delay adoption until we get principal feedback and pilot results?\nJudie, do you foresee resistance from staff if we impose restrictions without input?\nKatrina, would a phased rollout allow better equity monitoring?\nJon, does limiting initial rollouts protect against overburdening staff?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "kateacuff",
    "content": "I think the biggest problem is not so much the technology itself.\nIt's managing the behavior associated with it.\nI think we need to provide resources to teachers to assist them with that.\nI mean, I don't know that it's realistic to expect teachers to figure that out themselves.\nWe have a whole generation of young adults who grew up with this kind of technology.\nHow do we equip our teachers to deal with that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "judyle",
    "content": "Thanks, Kate.\nI really appreciate that point.\nJudie, do you think we should build an advisory team of experienced teachers to help shape the training?\nJudie, would a smaller pilot with weekly access be easier to monitor for equity?\nJudie, how do we make sure that training actually reaches every teacher\u2014and sticks?\nJudie, could we pair new training with a survey to check its impact after six weeks?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ellenosborne",
    "content": "Judie, do you think pairing training with a post-survey would help us track effectiveness?\nKate, could we explore using veteran teachers as peer mentors for newer staff?\nJon, do you think involving teachers early reduces long-term workload stress?\nGraham, please check if Dr. Jones can send a brief summary ahead of tonight\u2019s meeting.\nJudie, do you think monthly progress checks would keep things on track?\nKatrina, would biweekly updates from schools help refine the process?\nDavid, do you think we\u2019ll get meaningful data from a single-week trial?\nJon, does a smaller rollout still serve equity well?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "jonnoalcaro",
    "content": "Yes, I think it does, Judith.\njonnoalcaro: And I think that's a good way to go.\njonnoalcaro: And I think it's always nice to hear from the experts."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "katrinacallsen",
    "content": "Yeah, I guess I'm just curious, though\u2014I guess I'd like to hear more from David, though, about why he thinks we're doing this, because I guess I don't understand exactly what the purpose of changing it is, unless it's just a matter of trying to get rid of it completely.\nkatrinacallsen: But then I guess I would say, you know, I don't know if we need to be spending time on it, because I guess I don't know what the goal is."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "davidoberg",
    "content": "Katrina, I think the goal is helping kids stay focused\u2014not eliminating tech entirely.\nJudie, do you think clarifying the purpose upfront would reduce confusion among staff?\nKate, could we define \u201cdistraction\u201d more precisely to avoid subjective enforcement?\nJudie, do you think clearer expectations would make training more effective?\nGraham, could you summarize the rationale behind the change for the record?\nJon, does emphasizing intent rather than devices align with restorative practices?\nJudie, would linking training to real classroom scenarios increase buy-in?\nDavid, could we clarify if this is about discipline or instruction?\nKatrina, do you think knowing the \"why\" helps teachers adapt faster?"
