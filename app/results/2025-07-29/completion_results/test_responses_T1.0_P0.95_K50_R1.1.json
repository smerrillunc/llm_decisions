Again, just doing the head math, it seems as though adding one FTE still puts us below the ratio that we were at before last year. Is that correct?\naurenmacle: So it should put us at the same ratio we were at the last year. It's just in terms of when we look at our ratio, the ratio of students to teacher varies from one to 20 for a student who's a newcomer, or one to 50 if they are in, say, a level four, have recently exited. And so when we look at the ratio, it kind of depends on the breakdown of the students at each school. I see.\njudyle: And so this will put us back to where we were before. Because I guess my question is,  just based on the numbers, it doesn't seem like it quite puts us back to that ratio. And I also wonder how successful that ratio was. Like, my question is, I guess, if we can measure the success of what the ratio has been in the past and what that looks like and fund appropriately for the ESOL population.\naurenmacle: So we can look at getting the WIDA data and specifically the growth data that the state looks at to track English learner progression and look at the different ratios and we can collect that and provide that to you all.

They may not necessarily be receiving direct ESOL instruction, but they might be receiving additional support from the ESOL teacher, such as extra help with assignments, assistance with understanding vocabulary, things like that.

And I would like to respectfully request that we do so.  I think there's a lot that could be said about it and probably more eloquently by some of our other board members. But just from my role as an assistant city attorney, I can say that I don't think we're escaping any kind of liability by not taking action when we already effectively are banning it through our superintendent. And we're opening ourself up to a lot of optics problems and beyond optics.  We're sending a message to our students. It's really easy to resolve since we already are not allowing students to wear Confederate imagery. And I think it's time that we make a resolution and move on.

And I guess we all know this, but in middle school, the grade levels stay together in a group. So when the sixth graders eat lunch, the seventh graders and eighth graders are not. So that would be an example of they've been together, they're together in their classes and the school principals can figure out how to keep them together in those groups. I just was offering that as another consideration that the pediatricians gave us to think about as a strategy.\njudyle: Okay, I guess when I'm thinking about cohort groups, I'm not thinking about them as like 106 graders.

It's all dependent on whether you can even physically go back together. Right. And that's correct. The second thing is this is gonna. We already have budgetary concerns. How is this going to impact? I mean, you know, we're adding at a month. Do we.  keep you at your income, you're just going to work an extra month, which would be two jobs.\ndeboracollins: How we thought about it is how we thought about this is we get stimulus money, we get we're going to receive about $1.2 million for cares, which is it which is really intended for these kind of purposes. So this would help us.  do at least the first two options. The third option, I think, could get a little bit more complicated depending on who you wanted to extend the school year for, but we also know that as we move through the year, we may have some better revenue pictures or so that, you know, we could make those decisions a little later on as we go forward. We've also, I mean, as we start thinking about this, could, you could think about something like this if you were to limit the number of students in school every day. So if you looked at some of the models that we're seeing in other countries, not every child is coming every day. So you might have half the students coming one day or 20% of the students coming.

We continued to project an increase in FY21 to reflect the previous year's increase, but that was a year of our largest decline due to the pandemic.  As we build towards FY23, we are projecting an increase in actual enrollment as represented by the orange dotted line, but a decrease in budget to budget enrollment as represented by the blue dotted line. We believe that this projection represents growth due to growing development in the county and students returning back to our schools. However, the reality is that homeschooling is increasing and had been before the pandemic  and we're using this current year's enrollment as a new baseline. Here, packed onto one slide, are the changes in budget due to enrollment and demographics, with the exception of special education, which will be presented later. The reason why this is shown all together is because these items are related and cannot always be distinguished from each other. First, the budget-to-budget enrollment change.  The decreasing enrollment results in 29.4 fewer FTEs for the division based on our current staffing standards. Other smaller changes include a slight reduction due to the Crozet redistricting study that was approved, a modest increase in world languages staffing, and small increases in Center One and ESOL staffing. These increases are offset by the elimination of contingency FTEs that were budgeted in the FY22 budget.  After these enrollment and demographic changes, we are proposing to maintain the level of staffing that we have in our schools this year by reducing our staffing ratios by one student. In doing so, we would be adding back the approximately 30 FTEs that are reduced in the top portion of this table. This net change results in an approximately zero FTE change from budget to budget in this category.  Dr. Haas presented this class size reduction proposal and the draft funding requests.

        "How did homeschooling become such a significant trend?  Speaker 3: I think it's probably a combination of factors. Pre-pandemic, there was already a steady increase in homeschooling rates. Some parents preferred having more control over their children's education, while others might have chosen homeschooling due to concerns about bullying or school safety. When the pandemic hit, many families opted for homeschooling as a response to the uncertainty and inconsistency in public schooling. Even though most schools returned to in-person learning, some parents decided to stick with homeschooling because it worked well for them or their child thrived in that setting. Additionally, the availability of online resources and curriculum has made it easier for parents to take on homeschooling responsibilities effectively. So,",
        "Can you clarify how the enrollment numbers for this school year were adjusted? What specific numbers were changed?  unknownspeaker: Yes. So, when we built our FY23 budget, we used this year's enrollment as a new baseline. For example, last year we had projected about 13,400 students, but this year we actually got up to 12,800. So, we took that 12,800 as our starting point. In terms of how we adjusted that number going forward, we did account for some of the things that Dr. Haas mentioned earlier, like the growth in the county. But we also acknowledged the trend of homeschooling. It's not just a COVID-related thing; it's something that has been happening steadily over"

Last month, we had the wonderful opportunity to hear from Baker Butler educators about the nationally recognized gains they have made in closing the achievement gap at their school.  Tonight we're focusing on yet another opportunity gap in our schools and in schools across our nation, the percentage of students of color who enter STEM related fields. 45 years ago, an organization was established to address this issue, the National Society of Black Engineers. Its mission was ambitious and vital to the collective prosperity of every community in the United States.  The society was organized to promote academic excellence, provide scholarships, train leaders, and expand access to professional careers. A few years ago, the society broadened its charter to include high school chapters, and one of the first chapters in Central Virginia was established at Albemarle High School. Membership is open to students from all of our middle school and high schools, regardless of race or ethnicity. Students from Greer, Burley, and soon Walton are members and students  are members, and students from UVA serve as mentors. There currently are 25 students in our local chapter, and more than 100 students have had their lives changed by this extraordinary program. Many have gone on to earn engineering degrees at the university level. The driving, guiding, determined light for these young people continues to be Ms. Pearl Early, Albemarle High School student support specialist.  A characteristic of this program is its strong emphasis on project-based learning. Students learn how to research, design, experiment with, and refine solutions that can improve our lives. A natural topic this year is COVID-19, and true to form, students have come up with an ingenious approach to protecting public health. I understand that the nature of this development process is that it can take up to two years, but our students have field-tested their invention within seven months.  I'd like to ask Ms. Early to tell us a little more about the journey of her students over these past seven years, and to introduce us to today's superstars who will tell us about their new discovery.

And so we wouldn't necessarily want to solely rely on this app to report acts of racism and to follow up.

Now, again, one thing that we did learn from the student focus groups is that just because you have an app doesn't mean everyone knows how to use it. We need to provide additional support and resources. And also, the app isn't meant to be the only way that students can report incidents.

So that lack of transparency around the process can lead to feelings of mistrust.

I know that we're not dealing with unlimited resources and we have to make a lot of really difficult decisions to educate 14,000 students. So I really appreciate all the work that staff has done and definitely the people on the ground who are doing every day. So I really appreciate that.  I just have a concern about the equity between the virtual learning and the hybrid learning. Also because we know nationally and locally that more of our black and brown families are choosing that. So I just want to make sure that we have some assurances. It will be important to me that we have some assurances that is robust for my decision making.  Firstly, I have a question about intervention services. And I think a way for me to be able to get my head around this is to know how many students will lose intervention services in stage four as it is now. And I know that you don't have those numbers ready, but that's something that I would like to know next week. Also, I would like to know how instructional hours for the hybrid learners will compare with the instructional hours  of the virtual learners in K-3, or pre-K-3, I guess, for the four-day-a-week students. I assume that the 4-5, 4-12, I guess, would be the same. But I just would like to know the difference, if there is any difference between the instructional time for those youngest learners.  And then I also would like to know how if or how meal services will be affected. For the students who are at home. And then on a different note, I don't know if this is something that  Ross considers or we consider how this works. But I wonder if we should be looking at updated mask guidance, given that the new variant is likely coming or here.

I have one at Western, one at Henley, and one at Brownsville. That's a lot of contact they're having with a lot of people during the day. And my youngest is in preschool, and he just turned five over winter break. And since he was a year old, he has had a history of asthma that has required hospitalization from time to time. Luckily,  he didn't get very sick of with anything during the pandemic and we really haven't had to worry about it. But as the older ones went back to school and he was unable to be vaccinated, every day felt like a game of chicken between them, my older kids getting back to normal, and the health of my younger one. And masking seems like the least possible thing that we can do for  people in my situation who have unvaccinated people at home. Thankfully now he's vaccinated he had his second dose last week so in two weeks from now, hopefully, will be a step closer. But that's a new development, and it is terrifying to think of what would have happened if that had not.  happened before everything with masking came up. So I'm so grateful that everybody on the board recognizes that this is the least that we can do, adhere to these safety protocols to protect our entire community, not just the little ones that we're entrusted with every day, but their families and their neighbors and their friends.

The last couple years have been a real struggle, but for many people like me and my family. We were all able to get vaccinated and it felt like things were starting to get back to normal and we all want that so badly, but we've got to acknowledge that we're just not there yet there's still many people in our community.  who are extremely vulnerable to the virus as they have been from the beginning. Nothing has changed for them. And some of them are kids and staff at our schools. They're people we live with and go home to and people we work with. And they do not have a choice in the matter. I believe it's our moral obligation to do everything we can to protect the most vulnerable people in our community.  I think politicizing public health policy like masking that is scientifically proven to work is shameful and forcing our kids and teachers to deal with the controversy within the classroom where the focus should obviously be on learning is sad and it doesn't serve anyone well.

The school mass requirement helps us make sure that our daughter can be in school learning while our son's health is protected. And I'm incredibly grateful to you all for not forcing our family to choose between one child's education and another child's health.  But even if that wasn't our situation, we would still support keeping masks in place for now. We teach our kids that their choices and actions have consequences. Wearing a mask isn't just an individual choice. It has consequences for the people, the kids, the teachers around you. Our schools are helping our children learn to be good citizens, to consider the impact of their actions on the people around them.  My daughter understands that she wears a mask not just to keep her little brother safe, but to be compassionate and considerate of the people in our community. That includes her friends, teachers, and school staff who have health conditions themselves, or vulnerable family members at home. And we keep wearing masks to respect the work and sacrifice of the healthcare workers who are struggling through incredibly long hours in the midst of another COVID surge.  We are all eager to be done with COVID and put the pandemic behind us. But the reality is just that we're not there yet. And we've all got to come together for a little while longer to stop the spread of this disease and keep each other safe.

So, I think we talked about earlier, we did a survey, I believe it was last year or maybe the year before, comparing our nurse salaries, and if I remember correctly, we were below the average for those. The other facilities that you mentioned are in the market area, if you will. It may not be exactly the same level positions, but that would also be another factor in terms of their ability to attract and retain staff. It could be an issue.",
        "Okay, fair enough. I think one of the things here is looking at the local labor market data as well so that's definitely something I'm going to want to consider for future planning purposes, especially when we're talking about staffing and recruitment, but moving forward, in terms of a comparison of compensation packages, yeah, that's definitely something that I'd like to explore further too because right now, from my understanding based on what we discussed earlier, there is no real clear distinction that if they go to UVA or Centra, that their salary is significantly higher than what we would offer them. Is that correct?  Right. So then, I guess another follow-up question, does the hospital offer any type of relocation incentives or tuition reimbursement programs",

All right, well, we also met what 1094 and 1095 tax reporting requirements that were required for the Affordable Care Act. So that too is a good benefit. All of the benefits that we have in that section  quite nice, and like we were talking about before, that benefit package might really help us to sort of keep some of our employees, even though some of our nurses, for instance, may not be able to make as much money outside of, you know, if they stay in the county. Some of these benefits, I think, could be able to sort of keep some people here, draw some in. I think that would be pretty important.

It could be to just say, this is what you have.

We do offer several different vendors for 403b and 457 which are defined contribution plans similar to like 401k and those vendors do provide different education opportunities for how to do that pre-tax savings through payroll deduction and that will be enhanced as we go forward  because we'll be entering into an RFP process in the not too not too distant future to secure new vendor services for that.

It was an expanded family medical leave, and it covered employees if they needed to be home because they were ill or a family member was ill.  When that legislation expired, there was an option for employers to continue doing that. We've taken advantage of that and continue to offer those leave statuses or forms of those leave statuses to our employees out of the interest of their health and well-being.<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\ngrahampaige:",

All right, well, we also met what 1094 and 1095 tax reporting requirements that were required for the Affordable Care Act. So that too is a good benefit. All of the benefits that we have in that section  quite nice, and like we were talking about before, that benefit package might really help us to sort of keep some of our employees, even though some of our nurses, for instance, may not be able to make as much money outside of, you know, if they stay in the county. Some of these benefits, I think, could be able to sort of keep some people here, draw some in. I think that would be pretty important.

It's all dependent on whether you can even physically go back together. Right. And that's correct. The second thing is this is gonna. We already have budgetary concerns. How is this going to impact? I mean, you know, we're adding at a month. Do we.  keep you at your income, you're just going to work an extra month, which would be two jobs.\ndeboracollins: How we thought about it is how we thought about this is we get stimulus money, we get we're going to receive about $1.2 million for cares, which is it which is really intended for these kind of purposes. So this would help us.  do at least the first two options. The third option, I think, could get a little bit more complicated depending on who you wanted to extend the school year for, but we also know that as we move through the year, we may have some better revenue pictures or so that, you know, we could make those decisions a little later on as we go forward. We've also, I mean, as we start thinking about this, could, you could think about something like this if you were to limit the number of students in school every day. So if you looked at some of the models that we're seeing in other countries, not every child is coming every day. So you might have half the students coming one day or 20% of the students coming.

In terms of looking at these various allocations for the next year's budget,  I was hoping that if the School Board did want to use differentiated funding to,  say, increase the number of reading specialists, or increase the number of gifted resource teachers in schools, that there would be some placeholders there, so that those decisions could be made later. But looking at the draft budget, it seems like once again, the allocation of funding is being done sort of in isolation, without considering the whole package of priorities we heard during the work session. Did I misunderstand that?",
        "There hasn't been a net change based on the differentiated funding because in the meantime, of course, other factors like  VRS, healthcare contributions, other things were adjusted. But on the positive side, since we didn't adjust the formula last year either. Principals continue to use their differentiated funds to try and address the needs they saw fit at each site. So though we haven't changed the formulas, those dollars continue to flow down to schools for those purposes.",

Again, just doing the head math, it seems as though adding one FTE still puts us below the ratio that we were at before last year.

It's just in terms of when we look at our ratio, the ratio of students to teacher varies from one to 20 for a student who's a newcomer, or one to 50 if they are in, say, a level four, have recently exited. And so when we look at the ratio, it kind of depends on the breakdown of the students at each school. I see.\njudyle: And so this will put us back to where we were before. Because I guess my question is,  just based on the numbers, it doesn't seem like it quite puts us back to that ratio. And I also wonder how successful that ratio was. Like, my question is, I guess, if we can measure the success of what the ratio has been in the past and what that looks like and fund appropriately for the ESOL population.\naurenmacle: So we can look at getting the WIDA data and specifically the growth data that the state looks at to track English learner progression and look at the different ratios and we can collect that and provide that to you all.

I don't know that we've talked about that. And I just realized that I forgot to include in that, there'd be no transportation so I can restate that. And then we can do the discussion, I guess. So I move that the board approve the boundary changes as received in the superintendent's recommendation and that these changes, including in the grandfathering of  fourth graders at Brownsville Elementary with no transportation provided be implemented for the 2022-23 school year.

It was palpable.  So there are going to be real consequences for leaving those children  behind and making them switch schools. I think we need to remember what happened at Woodbrook.

That's that's I'll be honest, that's kind of a moving target. One of the things that we know is there are multiple ways that people are getting the vaccine. One is through our local clinics and we're we're hoping to be able to one of our Albemarle County clinics. We've done our first one. We're hoping to be able to do a second one.  We've been working with the Blue Ridge Health District, and that is all dependent on the available vaccine. They also are vaccinating people at the Kmart tent through the Blue Ridge Health District, and they're working on some other partnerships. And so, unfortunately, we don't have hard numbers on that. I don't know if Ryan can give us a little bit better sense of what's going on with that.\nryanmckay: So just to provide a little context, we were notified, I believe, two weeks ago that our weekly allotment for vaccine is 2850. That's for the entire health district. So if a primary care provider, a pharmacy or even one of our hospitals wants to order a vaccine, it has to come from that 2850 allotment, which has to cover our entire district.  So right now there is scarce availability for the vaccine and we need to spread that vaccine in a way that's most equitable to our entire community and so it makes it difficult to sort of carve out large chunks of numbers for individuals who receive the vaccine.  Based on our current schedule, those that have an appointment to get vaccinated are all in February at this point. We are trying to expand to the extent possible, and when we do, we'll make options available for K-12 educators, including those in Elmoral County, to access either by providing enough vaccine where they can operate that site again at Charlottesville High School in tandem with Charlottesville City Schools,  and the Regional Emergency Operations Center at our Kmart location or in hopefully the near future at the Big Lots location that is operated by UVA Health.

It's much higher than it has been in the past. I asked him how much higher, he didn't have the numbers on hand, but he said,  It's 612. Did someone say something? It's 612 students. OK, great.

And we were looking at with the students what type of app. At first, we were looking at the how we could literally create an app that would talk to us in distance, you know, making sure we're six feet or whatever. But that is something that we are still going to be looking at to answer your question. But then we wanted something that,  We know that the school division could use and not only use but assure the community as a whole that they were doing something to  make sure that everyone is safe. And this is one project or this app can do that, as you all saw at witness is tracing. And so it's the beginning, but yes, that's what NSBE does over these seven years or more.

Also I had an email asking whether the parking lot behind those houses behind the community center would be able to be used for parking during events. The reason they asked me that was that they were curious why there were no plans to develop or put some extra parking spots. And I didn't see anything. So if someone could speak to that.

In short, just to keep new board members up to date on what we're doing, the VSBA puts together a packet of legislative proposals, which are basically things that they go and lobby the legislature for, the state legislature. The proposals are submitted by various counties and localities, and then they put together a list. It's very brief this year. I welcome you to look over it. If you have anything you want me to say when we vote on these, I'm happy to do so.  Nothing seemed particularly contentious. There was only one proposal that had one dissenting vote. So they're all vetted. They're all vetted before they come to us to look at. There's only one dissenting vote in the whole packet. And that was about having behavioral interventionists as a standard of quality position, which would open up some funding sources for getting basically more mental health counselors and helpers into our schools. If  I'm assuming we won't have any issue with this. So then when I go to the VSPA delegate assembly meeting, which is occurring on Monday, I will just vote yes. And then they will, the VSPA will use its lobbying arm to push these proposals and hopefully get some of them passed. It usually is a long process that takes a little bit of time. It usually kind of you propose something and then you propose the next year and eventually maybe something happens.  So yeah, if we're all in agreement, then that's all I need is the support of the board to vote yes for the VSBA to lobby for these proposals.  I will say real quick, just one thing that, and Dave, you did this last year, right? One thing that kind of shocked me the first go around was just that the positions don't all necessarily align exactly with what we want to do as a school board, because mainly the VSBA is just advocating for local autonomy. So it's really just about the ability for school boards to make their own decisions. So how do you guys feel about it?",

Our next item is GBR JHCA student health services, which includes a lot of important new language, including for students with chronic illness, medical conditions requiring ongoing support, mental health and substance abuse care, COVID protocols and so on. Also, there are new procedures added regarding communication of a diagnosis by school nurses to parents and also guidelines for school sponsored events. So",

It seems that as part of our responsibilities, the school board is tasked with reviewing our policies to make sure they align with Virginia code. And I believe it's supposed to be on an ongoing basis, it looks like we're going to review them in batches because there are quite a lot. I know a little bit about my other job at UVA. We have to do something similar where we review policies every five years. So this makes sense. What I'll say is just a general comment about the process is I appreciate us working with VSBA and doing this comprehensive approach. But as we go through"
