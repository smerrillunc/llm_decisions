It's a little easier in my house because my children are a little older and actually one of them is now in college upstairs, but in college.

Some of those just really don't come across as effectively online, even if you've got the best person on the staff providing services. It's a tough one. And our students are really rocked by the loss of the very dependable schedule, particularly students on the spectrum. They really count on that. They're missing their teachers, their classmates. They're missing knowing what's going to happen every day and knowing what's expected of them. And I know for us personally, our case manager has been wonderful. She's checking with us, checked with us multiple times before we even started distance learning. And she's had a Zoom conference with my daughter already. And that does help, but unfortunate helps for my children. It's not helping for all children and for all ages. And we know they're trying so hard. We love our special education teachers, case managers, they're wonderful. But some of them have admitted that quite frankly, they're terrified. How are they going to give these wonderful services and this amazing education under this new system?\nkevinkirst: Yes, wonderfully put, Stephanie. Just regular barriers that children with disabilities have in our public schools are exacerbated when you can't be in the same space with them to provide all that Stephanie mentioned. So it's compounded.\nstephanie: I would also encourage that when we do start looking at moving back into a classroom, we help prepare these students. For some of them, it may be like starting school for the very first time. these large gaps, when you think about when they come back in August after three months away, and that's three months that we anticipated and where their lives can go on as normal, we can expect to see some behavioral issues, some definitely executive function issues, getting back into the schedule, back into listening and following directions and planning to get their assignments done and working with teachers.

Are there opportunities for additional feedback from the community or stakeholders beyond the public comment period on May 7th? Or should we assume that once we've received the recommended budget, the only changes being considered would be minor adjustments based on new information?

As we build towards FY23, we are projecting an increase in actual enrollment as represented by the orange dotted line, but a decrease in budget to budget enrollment as represented by the blue dotted line. We believe that this projection represents growth due to growing development in the county and students returning back to our schools. However, the reality is that homeschooling is increasing and had been before the pandemic and we're using this current year's enrollment as a new baseline. Here, packed onto one slide, are the changes in budget due to enrollment and demographics, with the exception of special education, which will be presented later. The reason why this is shown all together is because these items are related and cannot always be distinguished from each other. First, the budget-to-budget enrollment change. The decreasing enrollment results in 29.4 fewer FTEs for the division based on our current staffing standards. Other smaller changes include a slight reduction due to the Crozet redistricting study that was approved, a modest increase in world languages staffing, and small increases in Center One and ESOL staffing. These increases are offset by the elimination of contingency FTEs that were budgeted in the FY22 budget. After these enrollment and demographic changes, we are proposing to maintain the level of staffing that we have in our schools this year by reducing our staffing ratios by one student.

Dr. Acuff, did you want to talk about the expenditures?<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nkateacuff: My question has to do with the work session and the program evaluation we did about differentiated funding and how that played out in this budget. I mean, two is my understanding that two of the main ways that principals utilize that differentiated staff funding was to reduce class sizes, which we're doing across the division. and also perhaps to add some mental health or social workers, which are also doing. So what kind of impact has that had on the school-based operational funding? I flipped through school by school, but perhaps you have a bottom line for me.<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nmayakumazawa: We are still working on ways to incorporate that evaluation into the budget. We thought we needed further discussion with the school board on what actions you wanted to take in terms of changing our formulas and staffing standards to incorporate any of that feedback. So as of how the draft funding request stands, there are no formulaic changes that have been made besides the class size reduction. Thank you.<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nkateacuff:",

Again, just doing the head math, it seems as though adding one FTE still puts us below the ratio that we were at before last year. Is that correct?\naurenmacle: So it should put us at the same ratio we were at the last year. It's just in terms of when we look at our ratio, the ratio of students to teacher varies from one to 20 for a student who's a newcomer, or one to 50 if they are in, say, a level four, have recently exited. And so when we look at the ratio, it kind of depends on the breakdown of the students at each school. I see.\njudyle: And so this will put us back to where we were before. Because I guess my question is, just based on the numbers, it doesn't seem like it quite puts us back to that ratio. And I also wonder how successful that ratio was. Like, my question is, I guess, if we can measure the success of what the ratio has been in the past and what that looks like and fund appropriately for the ESOL population.\naurenmacle: So we can look at getting the WIDA data and specifically the growth data that the state looks at to track English learner progression and look at the different ratios and we can collect that and provide that to you all.

I live in the Whitehall District, and I wanted to thank you for continuing to uphold the masking policy, given our current rate of community transmission. I was going to cite statistics about how relying on vaccinations as the primary mitigation strategy is inherently inequitable, given the fact that many people remain unvaccinated or under vaccinated for reasons that have nothing to do with choice. I can remind you that COVID-19 disproportionately impacts black, brown, immunocompromised, and low-income families and families without the ability to work remotely much more significantly than white or affluent families, families who aren't already dealing with significant health challenges, and families with flexible work options. In the absence of readily available and accessible testing opportunities, masking remains our most equitable mitigation strategy to limit the spread of COVID-19 and to keep schools open. To be clear, I share the urgency to return to normal. I recognize that declining mental health among children and teens is a major concern, but there are many factors that have contributed to student mental health decline and masks are not one of them. There's a loss of normalcy, yes, but also the literal loss of loved ones and family income disruption and loss of social interaction and endless anxiety over all the different ways COVID has or could impact their lives. There has been fear and not just fear of COVID. In our county, in one semester alone, there have been multiple social media threats that have led to lockdowns and arrests. That's traumatic for children and teens. active shooter drills, divisive politics, the existential threat to our democracy, world leaders' inability to take substantive action to combat the climate crisis, angry parents yelling at school board members or suing school divisions over a curriculum that includes fact-based history lessons and policies that make schools more inclusive of all students. What are we doing? Mask wearing is not the problem, and fear is not ruling our lives, but compassion should. We want our community to be healthy. We want our children to learn the truth. We want our kids to be safe. We want our kids to care about each other. And everyone wants our kids to be in school. So masking for now is a way to keep our schools open. And it's also how we show our neighbors and especially our healthcare workers that we care. It's literally the least we can do for each other.

Like everyone, I would be delighted for things to go back to COVID, pre-COVID normal. But we recognize that we aren't there yet. I have four children. I have one at Western, one at Henley, and one at Brownsville. That's a lot of contact they're having with a lot of people during the day. And my youngest is in preschool, and he just turned five over winter break. And since he was a year old, he has had a history of asthma that has required hospitalization from time to time. Luckily, he didn't get very sick of with anything during the pandemic and we really haven't had to worry about it. But as the older ones went back to school and he was unable to be vaccinated, every day felt like a game of chicken between them, my older kids getting back to normal, and the health of my younger one. And masking seems like the least possible thing that we can do for people in my situation who have unvaccinated people at home. Thankfully now he's vaccinated he had his second dose last week so in two weeks from now, hopefully, will be a step closer. But that's a new development, and it is terrifying to think of what would have happened if that had not. happened before everything with masking came up. So I'm so grateful that everybody on the board recognizes that this is the least that we can do, adhere to these safety protocols to protect our entire community, not just the little ones that we're entrusted with every day, but their families and their neighbors and their friends.

And I also want to express my appreciation to the school board and staff, teachers, bus drivers, everyone for doing what they can to keep our kids in school safe. The last two years. The last couple years have been a real struggle, but for many people like me and my family. We were all able to get vaccinated and it felt like things were starting to get back to normal and we all want that so badly, but we've got to acknowledge that we're just not there yet there's still many people in our community. who are extremely vulnerable to the virus as they have been from the beginning. Nothing has changed for them. And some of them are kids and staff at our schools. They're people we live with and go home to and people we work with. And they do not have a choice in the matter. I believe it's our moral obligation to do everything we can to protect the most vulnerable people in our community. I think politicizing public health policy like masking that is scientifically proven to work is shameful and forcing our kids and teachers to deal with the controversy within the classroom where the focus should obviously be on learning is sad and it doesn't serve anyone well. I believe following CDC and our local health districts guidelines at this time is the most reasonable way to prevent the spread of COVID in and outside of our schools. and I appreciate you for continuing to follow them.

Oh, I'm sorry, Dr. Lyons. My name is Allison Lyons. I'm a parent of two children in the Whitehall District. Both go to Brownsville. I'm also a general internist as well. And thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak. First, I want to express my appreciation for the school board and all of the teachers and administrators at ACPS. It's been an unprecedented time over the past two years, and I really want to express my appreciation for all that you have done to support the teachers and the students and the staff, especially to keep our schools safe and have everybody return to in-person school over the past year in a safe setting and try to protect all of our students. Specifically, my son, my older son, has leukemia. He's been fighting leukemia for over the past three years and underwent a bone marrow transplant this past year. And I really want to express appreciation for how much Brownsville has done for him to keep him safe over the past three years and keep his brother safe in order to not transmit COVID to him prior to going through his bone marrow transplant. But I think the important thing to keep in mind as we keep these vulnerable populations safe is that we want to make sure that we keep are high risk patients and students safe. And we don't, we need to think about this equitably because it's not just students who have comorbid illnesses. It's also students who have parents at home who might have comorbid illnesses. It's also students who might have increased difficulty accessing care and if we if we change our policies without thinking about it ahead of time, we could actually kind of provide unequitable care to our students and kind of. shortchange them, so I think we need to think kind of critically about what we do if we end up changing our policies. ahead of time, so I think I really want to express appreciation for how you've addressed EO2. And just want to kind of how thoughtfully you have gone about protecting our students over the past two years, because I really greatly appreciate how well you've protected my son. I also want to appreciate how well you've taught diversity and history. And I hope that you guys continue to kind of think about the diversity curriculum in terms of how you teach it within our schools to make sure that they're prepared for facing the greater world. going forward, because I think it's really important that we prepare our children to really be aware of different cultural backgrounds other than our own, so that when they go to college or go to graduate school, they're fully prepared. And I'm not sure if EO1 will really prepare us for that. Thank you. I appreciate your time.<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\njonnoalcaro:",

I'm showing up tonight with a simple message of thanks. For the past week, I've had this non-word stuck in my head, all the moral, and it's stuck there because the ACPS mission is really to help all students thrive. And I see that all of you and ACPS have been working so hard to achieve this during incredibly difficult times. So tonight, I really just want to share how much we parents and families appreciate all that you're doing. So first of all, thank you to you school board members during a difficult time when it feels like public education itself is under assault. You've put in way more time and energy than I'm sure you thought you'd signed up for. And thank you for supporting the policies like the continued masking, at least for now, that are keeping our community safe. I also want to thank the principals and ACPS leaders, Dr. Haas and others who are on the call, not only for doing your jobs, but for serving in classrooms and on the bus lines and keeping our schools open. It's amazing. I want to thank the school nurses who have been great for putting themselves at daily risk to preserve the whole county's health. Our bus drivers are amazing. They're so lovely. They're getting our kids to school safely, including up and down some really steep, icy, narrow roads, in my neighborhood at least. And I want to really say how much I appreciate the bus drive, sorry, the substitutes, because I know that they're showing up to classrooms where they know there have been positive COVID cases, and they're still there, and they're keeping the schools open. And I have to send a call out to the school counselors for helping kids like mine who are struggling not only with physical illnesses, but also mental health issues and no surprise related to academic issues. And also to the counselors who are helping us parents who are really frankly sick with worry about pretty much everything these days. But most of all, I wanna thank the teachers because not only in the face of the pandemic, but also in the face of so much criticism and even scary political threats. They are all continuing to teach and inspire my kids. There are amazingly wonderful things happening in my kids' classrooms, and I just want teachers so much to know that the families of ACPS really support you. And that's it.

One area that really jumped out at me is the significant decline in support staff positions over the past two years. Specifically, looking at the custodial and maintenance roles, it seems like we've seen a 15% reduction since last year alone. That raises some concerns for me around building cleanliness, safety, and overall student well-being. Has anyone else noticed similar patterns or have any initial reactions to those numbers?\"",

What are some of the things involved in that section? in that portion.\ndanreddng: In terms of the COVID leaves? Yes, right. So at the beginning of the pandemic, there was a federal mandate for employers to offer leave for employees. It was an expanded family medical leave, and it covered employees if they needed to be home because they were ill or a family member was ill. When that legislation expired, there was an option for employers to continue doing that. We've taken advantage of that and continue to offer those leave statuses or forms of those leave statuses to our employees out of the interest of their health and well-being.\ngrahampaige: Then the other things that's listed under that same portion are also really important. They're really nice benefits, I think, for our employees to have. So let's see now.

All of the benefits that we have in that section quite nice, and like we were talking about before, that benefit package might really help us to sort of keep some of our employees, even though some of our nurses, for instance, may not be able to make as much money outside of, you know, if they stay in the county.

We do offer several different vendors for 403b and 457 which are defined contribution plans similar to like 401k and those vendors do provide different education opportunities for how to do that pre-tax savings through payroll deduction and that will be enhanced as we go forward because we'll be entering into an RFP process in the not too not too distant future to secure new vendor services for that.

How might this information guide the board's decisions when we get to budget time? We're very close to the budget season.

You know, between the restructuring and the pandemic, it's been a lot for our employees to absorb. So, in terms of success, I think just getting through that period without completely falling apart is an accomplishment in itself. As far as opportunities go, I agree with grahampaige - employee recognition and engagement is huge. If we can find ways to boost morale and make our staff feel seen and appreciated, that could pay big dividends down the line. Now, in terms of guiding our budget decisions...I'm thinking maybe we need to prioritize investments in",
        "Well, just thinking aloud, I mean, if we look at the success piece...one thing that stands out to me is that we seem to have made progress on communication, which has historically been an area where employees felt like we were lacking. So seeing that improvement is definitely a positive. As far as opportunities go, I'm concerned about the fact that we still have some significant disparities in terms of employee satisfaction between different departments and groups. I'd love to dig deeper into why that is and figure out ways to address it. In terms of the overall health of our workforce, it seems like morale is okay, but we need to keep working on building trust and addressing concerns around workload and resources. When we get to budget time, I think this",
        "Well, just looking at the recognition and engagement piece, I think that's huge. If we can find ways to make sure our employees feel valued and appreciated, that goes a long way towards building trust and morale. In terms of what I've learned from this review, I'd say my biggest takeaway is that while we're making progress in certain areas, we still have some significant challenges ahead of us - particularly with regards to staffing levels and workload management. As far as guiding our budget decisions, I think we need to prioritize investments in supporting our staff and addressing those workload issues if we want to avoid burnout and turnover. Maybe we could also explore additional training programs or professional development opportunities to help our staff build their skills and confidence. Does anyone else"

We've got a wealth of experience in that mid-range group, but as they near retirement, we risk losing valuable institutional knowledge.

Now, related to what Graham said earlier, about getting info out to everyone, I wonder if we might consider revamping our internal communications strategy.

COB, Steve Armstead --\"And next up is the Red Hill addition and renovation phase two, capital funding requests.\nrosalynschmitt: Rosalyn.\" Yes, this is mine as well. I don't have any slides for this. It's a brief update, but before I speak about the Red Hill project specifically, I want to provide a brief update on CIP. That update is that at this point, no major decisions have been made. We're working very closely with local government staff to debate the best, most conservative path forward and debating what critical projects should proceed in these uncertain times. So again, no decisions have been made. We're monitoring cash flow and just taking this step by step. But in the short term, we're keeping projects on track to ensure that nothing slips in the event that they do get a green light. So as you know, two of our major FY20 capital projects are the planned addition onto Red Hill and a planned addition on Scottsville. So both are in monitor phase right now, but we want to make sure That if they get the green light, we're good to go. So this one specifically around Red Hill, the item is for information only. It'll be on your consent agenda next week for action. So this is just considered your first read. And of course, it's also obviously contingent on the project proceeding. So if you recall, when we presented the design for Red Hill, we first shadowed some potential budget challenges. Nothing due to any scope creep, but just rather the small nature of that project and how it was initially budgeted. So bids were received on Monday. Unfortunately, the project did come in over budget. But the good news is that the Scottsville project bid a couple of weeks ago and was under budget pretty significantly. So we are recommending that the the board request money be transferred from the Scottsville project to the Red Hill project. This would take Board of Supervisor approval. We didn't have the specific amount when the agenda item was posted, but I have it now and it will be a part of the agenda item next week. The amount we're requesting is $919,748, so just about $920,000. About half of that is the add alternates for that project, including that stage addition, if you recall that, and some restroom upgrades. So by transferring that full amount, that would allow all additive alternates to be accepted. But again, this is for information only. And so are there questions or comments before this is put on the consent agenda next week?\ngrahampaige: Most projects will proceed, but it's just that since Scottsdale is under and Red Hill is over, the two sort of balance each other out.\nrosalynschmitt: At this point, we don't know if either project will proceed at this point. We're still in a monitor phase. We just wanted to get these actions put in place in case it gets a green light, because this will be on your agenda for action next week. And then the Board of Supervisors action for May 6. So there's a series of meetings just to have this financial action. But again, there's no direction on whether the projects are going to proceed or not at this point. We'll know in the next couple of weeks. I had a question, and perhaps the train's too far down the track, but since we can't anticipate or we think that there might be some kind of recession, is there any way to re-bid?<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nkatrinacallsen:",

React Native is a cross-platform JavaScript library that can be used to develop both Android and iOS apps. We learn JavaScript in React Native through implementing features of the app. React Native has modules for scanning QR codes and getting the locations. The app connects to our next technology called Firebase. Firebase is a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications. We use Firebase for its authentication and cloud database products for registering and signing in users, as well as storing user data. To test all of our software, we use the mobile application Expo. Expo is a tool built around React Native to simplify and quickly build and test apps. This is the app we used to test our app in the previous videos. Now we'll pass it back to Luke.\nunknownspeaker: Thanks, John. So what we want to do in the future with our app to make it better is we want to build an admin user interface. It's just going to allow teachers or anybody to just search through the database. And since our software is pretty secure and we have GPS verification built in, what we really want to do is we want to add a feature that's going to prevent people from scanning a bunch of QR codes at one time. We're also gonna build in email verification so that people can't build an account on an email that isn't theirs. Now we're gonna go to the next slide. Okay, so what makes QR trace so important? Why should you choose it? Well, what's so important about it is it's made by students for students. We know what makes an app good and we've been using devices a lot. So we've tried to include that in it. It's very user friendly. You don't need to have any technical expertise to use it. You just have to tap a couple of buttons. It's effective. It does the job and it does the job well. It keeps accurate logs and it's good at it. It's private. You have task codes. You don't just log in with your email like I've done on a bunch of apps before. It's made for schools specifically. It's not just like made for stuff, it's made so that it'll work in schools. And it's really easy to change profiles. You can change any of the data on your profile, like you can change your name, you can change your passcode. Well, that's what makes QRT special. Now I'm going to hand it over to Miss Pearl.\npearlearly: Thank you, Luke. I want to thank all the students. Now we would like some questions. And so that we give the students some time, opportunity to answer your questions. You have questions?\nunknownspeaker: Are there any questions from any of our board members? I know we've seen this great product. So do we have any questions? I have a question, and that is, where does this go from here? I'm just, I'm so pleasantly amazed by what you've accomplished with this project. And what's the next level that you're going to take it to? So at the moment, we are working on Getting the requirements to put it on both the Apple Store and the Google Play Store, I believe, is what is used for Androids. And like Luke mentioned in the future direction slide, we're working on getting a admin page so that admin can see the data well and get that to see who the person was in contact with.

As a school board member, my primary concern is always student safety, which led me to wonder if you could elaborate more on the security measures integrated into QR Trace. How exactly does GPS verification ensure that individuals aren't able to scan multiple QR codes simultaneously? Additionally, considering privacy concerns, will administrators have access to individual students' information when they utilize the proposed admin UI?",
        "That was fantastic! Congratulations again to the team on such an impressive presentation. One thing I'd love to ask - you talked about having GPS location tracking integrated into the system. How will that information be handled? Will the district have access to individual student location data, or will that remain anonymous unless absolutely necessary? Additionally, could you elaborate more on how you plan to address concerns around equity and accessibility when it comes to requiring students to download the app and potentially not every family may have access to smartphones?",

I have a question, and that is, where does this go from here? I'm just, I'm so pleasantly amazed by what you've accomplished with this project. And what's the next level that you're going to take it to? So at the moment, we are working on Getting the requirements to put it on both the Apple Store and the Google Play Store, I believe, is what is used for Androids.

And then I just paid like $7 today to have an app where you literally are just matching things. So money to be made. Do you feel like you can make a new app after this? And does anyone have any ideas about apps? I'm curious.\npearlearly: Well, let me say this. At the very beginning, the students early back in April, when this COVID-19 hit our community and the country, but basically our schools, the students were very concerned about how they were going to get back into school and be safe. And so that's when Mrs. Barnes started to brainstorm with me and I with Mr. Coles before Alicia came on. And we were looking at with the students what type of app. At first, we were looking at the how we could literally create an app that would talk to us in distance, you know, making sure we're six feet or whatever. But that is something that we are still going to be looking at to answer your question. But then we wanted something that, We know that the school division could use and not only use but assure the community as a whole that they were doing something to make sure that everyone is safe. And this is one project or this app can do that, as you all saw at witness is tracing. And so it's the beginning, but yes, that's what NSBE does over these seven years or more. We have been working on projects from the University of Virginia into our schools, from the high school to the middle school. And we are very excited to be in Greer Elementary School. And so, yes, that's what you do. You constantly create and you move forward.<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nkatrinacallsen:",

Maybe we should consider sending out surveys or other communication channels ahead of time, before they leave for holidays, reminding them of these upcoming discussions and asking for initial thoughts.

It's not something I'm alarmed about or really seriously concerned about because I know that the Boys and Girls Club attention to detail, especially on subjects like this, is top notch. When the kids are out in the bowl or when they're looking out in the woods area, And because I think the woods is a really great aspect of this. What kind of safety, what kind of security will there be? We saw the people in the staff shirt. I'm looking at the one on the screen right now. Will there be staff people outside pretty much at all times when there are children outside?\njamesplerce: Jono, thanks. Great question. I love that you noted that there are two staff members in this depicted in this shot here. Anytime there are we have a rule of three, first of all. So there's never any one person alone with any other one person in any activity in the club. And then we also have a ratio of one to 18. And so there will always be one staff member leader for every 18 members. Very, very often it's it's even a lower ratio than that. In our summer programs, we have about two staff members for about every 22 kids. And so we will always have a eyes on eyes, supervising adults that have been background checked and certified safe leaders of our clubs inside the building, outside the building, field trips, any club activity.\njonnoalcaro: And I guess I know you said it, but I guess I missed it.

In short, just to keep new board members up to date on what we're doing, the VSBA puts together a packet of legislative proposals, which are basically things that they go and lobby the legislature for, the state legislature. The proposals are submitted by various counties and localities, and then they put together a list. It's very brief this year. I welcome you to look over it. If you have anything you want me to say when we vote on these, I'm happy to do so. Nothing seemed particularly contentious. There was only one proposal that had one dissenting vote. So they're all vetted. They're all vetted before they come to us to look at. There's only one dissenting vote in the whole packet. And that was about having behavioral interventionists as a standard of quality position, which would open up some funding sources for getting basically more mental health counselors and helpers into our schools. If I'm assuming we won't have any issue with this. So then when I go to the VSPA delegate assembly meeting, which is occurring on Monday, I will just vote yes. And then they will, the VSPA will use its lobbying arm to push these proposals and hopefully get some of them passed. It usually is a long process that takes a little bit of time. It usually kind of you propose something and then you propose the next year and eventually maybe something happens. So yeah, if we're all in agreement, then that's all I need is the support of the board to vote yes for the VSBA to lobby for these proposals. I will say real quick, just one thing that, and Dave, you did this last year, right? One thing that kind of shocked me the first go around was just that the positions don't all necessarily align exactly with what we want to do as a school board, because mainly the VSBA is just advocating for local autonomy. So it's really just about the ability for school boards to make their own decisions. So how do you guys feel about it?\njonnoalcaro: You know, I just have a question about one of them, but maybe you and I can talk off of outside of the meeting. It's on number three with the affordability of dual enrollment. And I think that we've got a lot of that covered. And so this may be involving other divisions more so than us.

I guess we just covered that as a division. I wasn't sure but I didn't figure it would affect us one way or another because it's just saying it should be as You should be able to decide.

In short, just to keep new board members up to date on what we're doing, the VSBA puts together a packet of legislative proposals, which are basically things that they go and lobby the legislature for, the state legislature. The proposals are submitted by various counties and localities, and then they put together a list. It's very brief this year. I welcome you to look over it. If you have anything you want me to say when we vote on these, I'm happy to do so. Nothing seemed particularly contentious. There was only one proposal that had one dissenting vote. So they're all vetted. They're all vetted before they come to us to look at. There's only one dissenting vote in the whole packet. And that was about having behavioral interventionists as a standard of quality position, which would open up some funding sources for getting basically more mental health counselors and helpers into our schools. If I'm assuming we won't have any issue with this. So then when I go to the VSPA delegate assembly meeting, which is occurring on Monday, I will just vote yes. And then they will, the VSPA will use its lobbying arm to push these proposals and hopefully get some of them passed. It usually is a long process that takes a little bit of time. It usually kind of you propose something and then you propose the next year and eventually maybe something happens. So yeah, if we're all in agreement, then that's all I need is the support of the board to vote yes for the VSBA to lobby for these proposals. I will say real quick, just one thing that, and Dave, you did this last year, right? One thing that kind of shocked me the first go around was just that the positions don't all necessarily align exactly with what we want to do as a school board, because mainly the VSBA is just advocating for local autonomy. So it's really just about the ability for school boards to make their own decisions. So how do you guys feel about it?\njonnoalcaro: You know, I just have a question about one of them, but maybe you and I can talk off of outside of the meeting. It's on number three with the affordability of dual enrollment. And I think that we've got a lot of that covered. And so this may be involving other divisions more so than us.

I've read through them. I was curious just because I thought dual enrollment was free for our students but I guess that's us covering the cost and I guess there is some kind of floor that they put on what you have to charge a minimum amount. I guess we just covered that as a division. I wasn't sure but I didn't figure it would affect us one way or another because it's just saying it should be as You should be able to decide.

In elementary schools, we're doing something a little different based on our continuity of learning. We are going to post and offer enrichment opportunities for all. So each week during July, we have teachers that will be posting to the division website, enrichment opportunities that are gauged to K2, K3, K5, and 6-8. So those opportunities are ones that any student can get involved in and can work through and work on. With our elementary schools, we're going to do a check and connect, which would be a sign up. So if a parent would like for a teacher to reach out to their student and work with them on the enrichment opportunities, then that would be something that the parent and child can sign up to do through the elementary school. And then we will continue offering our tutoring option. for identified students, which is typically what we offer during the summer school. So that would be the three phases or the three tiers that would be offered in elementary school. Similarly, in middle school, we'll offer an enrichment opportunity for all, a check and connect component with students who did not engage or complete their continuity of learning in the spring. And then we will continue offering our tutoring options to identified students. High school is exactly as offered with the summer school courses that students sign up for and participate in. We also will offer a check and connect for students who did not engage or complete the spring courses. As I said, these are July options.

Our teachers are amazingly creative.\nmatthewhaas: I've heard some great stories from students and families about the creativity of the teachers and how they figured out. Some of the students have had some of the best experiences they've ever had during this time. And many students really adjusted well to a different format for school. It was almost like a break that they needed. So one of the challenges that we talk about at our level is as we make these kinds of plans, we have to leave enough room for the creativity of our teachers, our families, and our students to be part of the idea generating process and the iteration of what a class is gonna look like because that's where engagement comes from. planning this out with enough detail to make sure everyone is safe and that everyone will be treated fairly and have the best access that they can is our job. And then allowing that level of creativity to come in from the school level principals, the teachers, and the families and students, that's where you get the engagement.\nunknownspeaker: Just one more question for me. How have we been doing with our English language learners? And do we have anything additional planned for the fall?\ndeboracollin: One of the things this kind of work allows us to do, if we have secondary students and not all the students are in the building at the same time, there could be groups of students that could come in every day. So English language learners could come in every day based on the kinds of scheduling we're looking at. They have been identified as high-risk learners. And all the task force documents from DOE, our task force, they're identified as a priority. So we would try to get them into school buildings as much as possible for as many days during the week as we could. So those become priorities for us. And as we start thinking about how we schedule, we look to those kind of principles, if you will, to help us decide.\njudyle: I had one more question about, oh, sorry, Katrina. Actually, it was based off something that you said earlier about teaching shortages. When you're looking at leave for teachers, is there a guideline of how long you think they would need, I mean, and I say that as someone who's been sick for 78 days. So I just am curious because I looked through the leave policy and, you know, I was just trying to figure out if teachers would have enough time and then if they would have coverage if they got sick. Dr. Kaiser.\nclarekeiser: Thank you. Sorry, it took me a minute to get the video on. One of the things that we know is that each individual person's need is going to vary. Like you said, for maybe an extended period of time, we will work as best as possible within the policy to allow the protections that are afforded to a person if they need some extended leave time because they themselves are ill.\nmatthewhaas: And one thing I would add is that there are different tiers of leave that as a person works their way through what their needs are, and if their needs to stay out are extended, then we continue to work with employees to help them extend their leave to as much as they can so that they have the time they need to get healthy and to come back to work. There's a lot built into that policy. I know it's like an inch thick when you try to read through it, but there's a lot in there built and designed around supporting employees and their families.\nunknownspeaker: Mrs. Colson, did you have a question?<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nkatrinacallsen:",

In light of potential COVID-19 cases or exposure, we must prioritize providing adequate resources, including substitute teachers and staff, to maintain instructional continuity while also respecting the health concerns of both educators and students alike. We'll want to discuss further how we plan to bolster our staffing infrastructure to accommodate any increased demand for substitutes due to illness-related absences. This might involve collaborating with local educational institutions, re-examining current policies, or exploring innovative solutions to guarantee seamless learning environments despite the unpredictable nature of this situation. Can we put that topic on our agenda for future discussions, please?",
        "Yes, thank you. I wanted to follow up on Judy's comment about teacher leaves and also tie it back to the issue of potential teacher shortages. As Matthew mentioned earlier, we already face difficulties filling certain positions even under normal circumstances. In light of COVID-19, we should consider whether we'll see increased absences due to illness or quarantine requirements. We may want to explore strategies to ensure adequate staffing levels throughout the year. Have we discussed contingency measures such as recruiting substitutes, adjusting teacher training programs, or tapping into local universities for support? We must proactively address any gaps before they negatively impact student learning. Can anyone share thoughts on this matter?",
        "Yes, thank you! I wanted to follow up on Judy's comment regarding teacher leave policies. While we appreciate your explanation, Matthew, my concern still remains that even though we may provide support for extended leaves, if we don't address the root cause - which is understaffing and overworked staff members - we might end up facing another shortage crisis down the line. Have we considered implementing measures to reduce workload or incentivize recruitment efforts specifically targeting hard-to-fill positions, especially now when we'll likely face increased demand due to COVID-related absences?"

This is not, starting before Labor Day is not the norm by any means. We have legal labor to do so.\nunknownspeaker: Yeah, that's good to point that out, Dave, because Albemarle County is an anomaly as far as our start date. Most of the school systems, particularly, the reason I look at it this way, too, is all around Richmond, the school systems start after Labor Day. And so the capitals in Richmond, the governors in Richmond, the VDOEs in Richmond, also on the south side, Peninsula, they all start after Labor Day. So we're all, we're just kind of looking at it that way that how do we get in alignment with moving toward phase three? Now, I do think it's important to ask our community and that's why we did the survey. And I really appreciate the board's patience with us having an established calendar and then coming back and saying, hey, would y'all entertain asking the public? And I'm really grateful to all the families for chiming in and letting us know what you think. I will say that I did discuss, I have been in discussion with a post-Labor-Day start with city school staff from the very beginning of our conversations about this. And I asked if city school staff would be interested in looking at this type of calendar. I understood at that time that there was some interest. They have not asked their community yet through a survey as to whether they would begin after Labor Day or not. I think they might, I think they may, but I obviously have no way of influencing that other than through collaboration. We do have, I am working on scheduling a meeting with our counterparts in the city for next Wednesday to discuss not only the post Labor Day start, but also what we are looking at as we begin to firm up our school site plans around offering instruction to students. I know they had already published some things to their community and I think they're also interested in learning more about what we're gonna be doing. I think it's important to just say those things because I want the board to know that we are trying to coordinate with the city and with what they're doing. If we end up on different schedules, we're gonna work with our staff. We're gonna work with our teachers, with our support staff to make sure that we meet their needs and help them as they make their way back to work.\njudyle: I have one more question about the survey data.

Can you all see my slide deck there?\nunknownspeaker: Yes, you're good, Jamie.\njamiegellner: Okay, thank you. I'm Jamie Gellner, the division program evaluator filling in on behalf of Nick King, our student services officer. And last week you asked us to put together a program review in our school resource officer program. So here are our ideas moving forward with a quick turnaround. And as Dr. Haas stated, we are gonna be providing with a lot of information and there will not be an evaluative part of the review. As you may know, our MOU, formerly called the Joint Protocol between ACPS and ACPD, states that the scope of the SRO responsibilities include these things, to promote a positive and supportive school climate, as well as safe and secure environments, to collaborate with the schools and to reduce and prevent crime, to minimize student involvement with the criminal justice systems. The MOU points out that the school resource officer, therefore, has many roles in our schools, including law enforcement officer, law-related educator, informal mentor and role model, resource for criminal charges and cases, and a resource for information on gang activity and participation. Our program has five officers, one at Albemarle High School and one to cover the rest of the feeder pattern, one at Monticello and one to cover the rest of the feeder pattern, and one in the Western feeder pattern. The SROs report to their own chain of command and Nick is our direct contact for ACPS. We will pull together several pieces of data for the board. The Code of Virginia requires school divisions to submit data to VDOE on incidents of disciplined crime and violence. Current reports contain selected comparisons to prior years. And this data are used also to complete federal reports required by the Gun Free Schools Act and the Individual with Disabilities Education Act. This report requires an annual reporting of the number of students suspended or expelled statewide for possessing or bringing firearms on school property. We'll also look at our state and local climate surveys, which have statements about how safe students feel at school, although they don't specifically ask about school resource officers. We will review the ACPS threat assessment reports from last year. We will send a survey out to students grades six through 12 tomorrow, asking them about their level of comfort with school resource officers and their experiences. We have already asked for principal input about their experience with school resource officers, and we will provide a research brief from Dewey Cornell, who is a professor in the career school at UVA, who is known for his research on youth violence and school security. We've also reached out to EAB for a quick turnaround research request on program outcomes of school resource officer programs, and have various other studies, articles, and applicable ACPS policies for your review. So today we have presented the items for the program review. June 26, we will present the complete information for the board's review.\nkateacuff: Jamie, with respect to the student survey, can we have a carve out like we did for the other survey to reach those that might not be available by computer online survey or Spanish speaking or I think we need a subgroup of that. Sure.\nunknownspeaker: I'll work with Jennifer and our communications team.\nmatthewhaas: And when we talked about doing this, I asked to make sure that when Patrick works on this, because he'll work with the survey component that Judy had mentioned earlier, she wanted to make sure it's broken out by demographic groups of respondents. So I want to be sure that we do that.\njamiegellner: We did. We've asked for school gender and we've allowed for optional choices for race and gender and for them to check all that apply in those categories.<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nkatrinacallsen:",

        "Thank you, Jamie, for presenting such a comprehensive overview of the program evaluation process for our School Resource Officer Program. It seems like you've covered quite a bit of ground so far. One thing I'd like to highlight is the importance of getting feedback directly from students themselves. In addition to the survey questions regarding their comfort levels with SROs and any personal experiences they may have had, could we also consider asking some open-ended questions? Sometimes the most valuable insights come from allowing people to share their thoughts freely without being limited by multiple-choice options. Additionally, given the diverse demographics within our district, it's crucial to ensure that we analyze responses based on different subgroups, just as Matthew mentioned, so that we gain a more nuanced understanding of potential",
        "Thank you, Jamie. That was very helpful. Just so everyone knows, since we got started late due to some technical issues, if anyone needs any additional time, please let me know before we move further into the meeting. Anyway, back to the topic at hand - regarding the student survey, Kate brought up a great point about reaching students without access to computers or non-English speakers. Is it possible to get more details about how exactly you plan to ensure representation among these subgroups? For example, could paper copies of the survey be made available, or maybe even phone calls or focus group discussions for certain populations? Additionally, while breaking down demographics within the respondent pool sounds promising, are there plans to compare responses across different racial, ethnic, socioeconomic",
        "Thank you so much, Jamie. That was very informative. I appreciate the comprehensive approach you guys took to gather feedback and data. It seems like we should get some valuable insights from both students, principals, and experts alike. How long does it take to receive the results from the survey? Do we expect any preliminary findings before the full presentation on June 26th? Additionally, since you mentioned pulling in external resources such as Professor Dewey Cornell and EAB, could you elaborate more on why we chose those specific sources and if there were others considered during the selection process?"

We had Kate, Elizabeth and Dr. Kaiser in our group, and we had a robust discussion and I may miss some of the points so Kate and Elizabeth, please feel free to jump in. So we were looking at administrators in particular. And we talked about the building up of administrators, nurturing them. And that was typically seen, like that was mostly seen as a good thing, but with a caution that when you look at the demographics of the administrators, how completely different they are from both the teachers and classified demographics. where mostly you're seeing like 72, 73% of teachers and classified staff, 77% are women, but only 53% of the administrators are women. So the question is, okay, so who is getting nurtured and brought up into the, to be administrators? The other question is the percentage of administrators who are internal and for the information that we have, it looks like about 72% of the administrative changes that happened in that year that was captured were internal. So promotions or transfers and then the other 1828%. Just doing quick math were external and so we're a school division that is really looking to make big changes in some of the you know, inequitable outcomes that we've seen. And I, I think that it can be hard sometimes to do that with so much of internal churn of the same sort of people. So that was just a concern that was brought up. We also had good discussions about substitutes and the support that we're providing with them. And it was encouraging to see that there a part of the big HR plan. So we're very happy to see that because they're a very important part of our ecosystem as we see more and more. And then we talked about how important it is to have the experience of teachers of color, but also we were interested in knowing more about the experiences of all employees of color Um, and especially since we, as an organization have a lot of like micro climates. So, um, you know, different schools might have different, I mean, certainly they do have different climates and different experiences for people of color.

We talked about, he explained a lot about the RIF and how that worked and how that net, how that net balances out. We talked about alignment with values and people staying and not staying. We also talked about how it's really not only just about money, but the conditions. And I think David and I are very inclined to halt on new initiatives and new things that take up space in people's head.

Whereas on Friday, March 13, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam ordered the closing of all schools in the Commonwealth for a period of two weeks to protect against the spread of the coronavirus. And whereas this action to protect public health through the closure of schools meant that students who participated in the federal government's free and reduced lunch program lost their access to the nutritious meals provided each day at school and Whereas in Albemarle County Public Schools, thousands of students were negatively impacted by this loss of access. And whereas among the school division's four values is its young people, specifically their academic and personal development, their health and well-being, And whereas in response to the closure of schools, the division's child nutrition department immediately began to plan to meet the needs of all children for healthy breakfast and lunches on a daily basis. And whereas within one business day of the governor's closure announcement, Child Nutrition Team members, under the guidance of Director Christina Pitzenberger, had organized a food distribution program. And whereas the program began with six school sites throughout the county, serving more than 1,000 meals a day to students and their siblings 18 years of old and younger. And whereas on March 23rd, The governor extended the closure of all K-12 schools in the Commonwealth through the end of the current academic year, and whereas the Child Nutrition Office continued to monitor the need among its students and all communities across the county for healthy meals and to work with the Department of Transportation in setting up additional food distribution sites, And whereas, as the result of this ongoing planning and teamwork, the office now distributes breakfast and lunches to students in 21 locations at schools and communities. And whereas, since March 17th, the Child Nutrition Office has provided more than 30,000 meals to students from all schools and locations in the county, and is continuing to evaluate the needs to further expand this service. Now therefore be it resolved that the Albemarle County School Board expresses its deep appreciation to Ms. Pitsenberger and her highly dedicated and skilled team for their invaluable support in meeting the nutritional and health needs of thousands of Albemarle County public school students and their siblings, and for doing so through such an expeditious and increasingly inclusive plan. And be it further resolved, the school board also salutes the contributions of the transportation department, its director James Foley, and his team for enabling the food distribution program to bring its services directly to the neighborhoods where students reside, thereby expanding participation in this vitally beneficial program.

This will enable them to better support our students who are struggling and help close the gap. Has anyone given any thought to this idea?",

Our new coding club has also taken off, with over 50 students participating after just one semester. However, I do want to bring up a concern regarding the budget allocation for teacher training. While we've made great strides in updating our curricula, I believe it's essential that we provide adequate support for our teachers to effectively implement these changes. Can we discuss possible solutions for allocating more resources towards professional development?",

Our research suggests that students who engage in hands-on science, technology, engineering, and math activities tend to perform better academically overall. With this in mind, we're proposing an increase in funding for STEM-related resources and professional development opportunities for our educators. Has anyone had a chance to review the proposal? Do you have any questions or concerns before we discuss further?"

And so when we look at the ratio, it kind of depends on the breakdown of the students at each school. I see.\njudyle: And so this will put us back to where we were before. Because I guess my question is, just based on the numbers, it doesn't seem like it quite puts us back to that ratio. And I also wonder how successful that ratio was. Like, my question is, I guess, if we can measure the success of what the ratio has been in the past and what that looks like and fund appropriately for the ESOL population.\naurenmacle: So we can look at getting the WIDA data and specifically the growth data that the state looks at to track English learner progression and look at the different ratios and we can collect that and provide that to you all.

In short, just to keep new board members up to date on what we're doing, the VSBA puts together a packet of legislative proposals, which are basically things that they go and lobby the legislature for, the state legislature. The proposals are submitted by various counties and localities, and then they put together a list. It's very brief this year. I welcome you to look over it. If you have anything you want me to say when we vote on these, I'm happy to do so. Nothing seemed particularly contentious. There was only one proposal that had one dissenting vote. So they're all vetted. They're all vetted before they come to us to look at. There's only one dissenting vote in the whole packet. And that was about having behavioral interventionists as a standard of quality position, which would open up some funding sources for getting basically more mental health counselors and helpers into our schools. If I'm assuming we won't have any issue with this. So then when I go to the VSPA delegate assembly meeting, which is occurring on Monday, I will just vote yes. And then they will, the VSPA will use its lobbying arm to push these proposals and hopefully get some of them passed. It usually is a long process that takes a little bit of time. It usually kind of you propose something and then you propose the next year and eventually maybe something happens. So yeah, if we're all in agreement, then that's all I need is the support of the board to vote yes for the VSBA to lobby for these proposals. I will say real quick, just one thing that, and Dave, you did this last year, right? One thing that kind of shocked me the first go around was just that the positions don't all necessarily align exactly with what we want to do as a school board, because mainly the VSBA is just advocating for local autonomy. So it's really just about the ability for school boards to make their own decisions. So how do you guys feel about it?\njonnoalcaro: You know, I just have a question about one of them, but maybe you and I can talk off of outside of the meeting. It's on number three with the affordability of dual enrollment. And I think that we've got a lot of that covered. And so this may be involving other divisions more so than us. That's interesting and I was curious about that one as well.\nkatrinacallsen: I'm certainly not an expert on these proposals. I've read through them. I was curious just because I thought dual enrollment was free for our students but I guess that's us covering the cost and I guess there is some kind of floor that they put on what you have to charge a minimum amount. I guess we just covered that as a division. I wasn't sure but I didn't figure it would affect us one way or another because it's just saying it should be as You should be able to decide. You should have the autonomy as a local school division to decide how much you want to charge for dual enrollment.\nunknownspeaker: I agree. Thank you. And I vote yes. Katrina, I didn't see it on there. Maybe I didn't read carefully. What is the status of the hold harmless for enrollment in terms of school reimbursements?\nkatrinacallsen: I do not know. I don't know if Helen's on. I would not be. I didn't read it in there in my packet, so I don't know.<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nellenosborne:",

The new variant has the same, masks against the new variant would be exactly the same. We see variations in viruses all the time. We've been expecting variants of this virus to come. The mitigation strategies that we talk about being NPIs or non-pharmaceutical interventions, i.e. masks, do not matter the individual strain. So instead of talking about that we would need a different mask, you would necessarily say that you need to double down on using masks. And I always tell people that when we think about this in public health circles, that the best mask is the one that someone is actually going to wear. And so we want to make sure that, you know, just like what you hear in kind of competing circles, that the masks that they wear are the ones that the kids are going to wear throughout the day.\nunknownspeaker: You know, somewhat of a mundane question, but it's still an important one, is I know that our pre-K through third graders have been taught about all the mitigation systems and processes. And we have fourth and fifth graders and middle schoolers and high schoolers all coming in pretty much at the same time with the exception of the extra day for the sixth and ninth. When will they be instructed to what those processes have to be? And will that be before they get to school or will that be something right as they get in there? And will they also be instructed, and I'm assuming that our existing students have been, in terms of what to do once they leave school, how to use hand sanitizers at home, how to wash and clean because of the importance to the school community as well.\ndebbiecollins: Correct, Mr. O'Carroll, that is exactly the plan. As we did moving from stage two to stage three, the schools will set up town halls for parents to work, to hear what stage four will look like and what it looks like in their school and transportation and all the different pieces that come with starting a school year for them coming into the buildings. and we will offer students that same kind of opportunity. And that's what we did with our K-3 students, and that's what we'll do with our 412. We'll continue to do that. The advantage of having the students come in, half of them one day and half of them another day, is that you can spend your first couple of days transitioning and having those conversations with students. So the 412, because they'll be in every other day, it will allow us to make those, training opportunities available.\njonnoalcaro: Terrific. Ms. Collins, will those sessions for the parents be the week before or a couple of weeks early so that they'll have an idea as to how the days are going to work and how the whole process will work?\ndebbiecollins: Yes. We anticipate if the decision is made next Thursday that those town halls would begin as early as the next week. they're in the queue, so to speak. Because we've done this before with our K-3 students, we've got a very tight plan as far as logistics and timetables.\nunknownspeaker: Thank you.<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nellenosborne:",

        "I'd like to build upon Debbie's point regarding the town hall meetings for parents. While it's great that we'll be providing information on the protocols and procedures for Stage 4, I think it's equally important that we emphasize the role parents play in reinforcing these habits outside of the classroom. Perhaps we could consider including some educational materials or resources specifically geared towards helping families develop healthy habits at home, such as proper handwashing techniques, mask-wearing, and social distancing practices. By empowering parents with the knowledge and tools they need, we can create a more cohesive effort between home and school, which ultimately benefits everyone involved. Has anyone considered partnering with local healthcare organizations or experts to provide additional support and guidance for our families during this transition?",

Perhaps we could consider providing some refresher materials or reminders for families over the summer break, especially since many students may have gotten out of the habit during remote learning. Additionally, I'd like to suggest that we explore ways to engage our upper-grade students more actively in promoting healthy behaviors within their peer groups. By empowering student leaders to take ownership of spreading awareness and encouraging responsible behavior, we might see even greater adherence to our safety protocols.

How do we plan to reinforce the importance of proper mask-wearing habits, especially among our upper-grade levels who may feel more resistant to following these protocols?

Obviously, I can't get down to that close of a level. I would love to.

I can't speak obviously to the suicidal ideations and the suicide attempts as whether that's been predominantly just from a lack of in person we clearly know that code is a general rule has been incredibly disruptive, you know, to this kid's age age group is a general rule. And so the only thing that I know that the studies have kind of borne out a little bit and what we've at least seen locally when you talk to the providers around here is that the biggest source of frustration and the biggest source of issues with the anxiety and depression, the eating disorders has been the lack of face-to-face instruction and just the lack of socialization that comes with school. Thank you. That helps me.\nangelpilkey: I'm not sure who to address this question to, but speaking to a bunch of students, they're wondering if and how they can change their plan from going to virtual or hybrid if they feel the need to. Because I know a lot of students have decided that, hey, I think I'm actually going to try out the hybrid version that I've talked to, and they're wondering if and how they can do that.\nunknownspeaker: They need to contact their principal. but is that something that's possible? It is possible.\ndebbiecollins: It will take us some, depending on the situation, it may take us some time. If transportation is needed, that's a set of circumstances that would have to be put into the mix. The other pieces for elementary schools, some of it is around space. So if the classroom has 10 children in it already, we have to think about how we would expand the classroom spaces to accommodate the students. Having said that, that's all the conversations that the principals have been having around making decisions and planning for students to come in. We anticipate that more students will become hybrid than are virtual at this point. So we've been planning around that to try to think about it so that we don't have to say to students that want to come in, you can't come in.\ndavidoberg: It strikes me, Dr. Collins, that we ought to be prepared for that to be sort of, there's a possibility, the extent that we reopen, there's going to be, that could be a growing issue.

What about if the person is in and decides to go to virtual? How long is the wait time for that?\ndebbiecollins: That tends to be able to happen faster because the logistics aren't involved of coming to school and getting a seat, if you will, in a classroom.

And I would like to respectfully request that we do so. I think there's a lot that could be said about it and probably more eloquently by some of our other board members.

And we're opening ourself up to a lot of optics problems and beyond optics. We're sending a message to our students. It's really easy to resolve since we already are not allowing students to wear Confederate imagery. And I think it's time that we make a resolution and move on. So I don't think we can make a motion at this meeting for something like that, although I am confused because we did make a motion for the holiday at the beginning.

And I guess we all know this, but in middle school, the grade levels stay together in a group. So when the sixth graders eat lunch, the seventh graders and eighth graders are not. So that would be an example of they've been together, they're together in their classes and the school principals can figure out how to keep them together in those groups.

One, Chad Ratliff coming from Community Public Charter School. I'm just, I just wanted to say that we saw exactly the same results as you've heard from the comprehensive school principals, overwhelmingly positive from teachers, students, and parents. It has been just a huge change for the better for us and to add even a couple other dimensions to it and a couple other perspectives as a parent of a seventh grader myself, I actually saw a little bit of the peer pressure to even have a phone subside. It was a little less this year than it was last year here and at home. And when thinking about the difference and how much less time I spent with the middle school on, particularly as Ashby mentioned, that cell phone drama with middle school students compared to last year, I also having a high school in the same building, it was also a noticeable difference in how much time in the day that we would be spending not talking to middle school students about cell phone usage, the drama or the inappropriate times, but continuing to talk about those things with high school students. So it was kind of an interesting thing for me to see both of those things in the same building. But in sum, I just wanted to thank the board on behalf of all the principals and the central office for letting us get together and put this together and give it a try. And I think it was very successful. Thank you.\njaythomas: Just in closing, before we take a couple of questions from you guys, I honestly, I mean, publicly, I think I've said I had a lot of concern about this initiative when we piloted this at the beginning, and just that it might cause a lot of problems. And I told at least one of the principals that, that I was concerned. And the principals did a wonderful job of working together, of communicating to all of their stakeholders, their teachers, their students, their families, the why behind why they wanted to have these cell phones put away. And it's been a very wonderful, very pleasant experience this year so far with our students and our staff. So if you guys have any questions, I know they're all available to help answer any specific questions you might have. Any questions from the school board?\nkateacuff: Jay, is there any particular reason to limit it to middle school?\njaythomas: No, the pilot this year was the middle school principals coming to me and Debbie and asking, hey, is this something that we can do? And so we met with them and strategically went through the process of developing everything we shared with you. About a month ago or so, we have shared the results with the high school principals to ask them if they were interested in piloting this as well. So those conversations have begun at the high school about whether we would move that way or not.\njonnoalcaro: I have one question, and that is, I guess it's more of a comment, is that after a couple more years, all three of the grades that are sixth graders this year, they'll all be gone. And the kids who are coming up will just know that when you get to middle school, you can't have your cell phone. And then it's just going to be part of the culture. And I think that that's going to be, that'll take a lot of pressure off of everybody because not only will the students know, the teachers obviously will know, but their parents will know as well.

As we consider expanding this policy to high schools, I'd like to explore ways to engage with student leaders and involve them in the decision-making process. By doing so, we can ensure that their voices are heard and valued, which could lead to increased buy-in and ownership among students.

Moving forward, I'd like to explore ways to ensure sustainability and consistency across all grade levels. Perhaps we could consider expanding professional development opportunities for educators to effectively integrate technology into lesson plans while maintaining the benefits of this policy.

Um, next up is announcements. Uh, Dr. Haas.\nmatthewhaas: So I just had a quick announcement that, um, we are going to be moving forward with, um, uh, the Murray high school and a community public charter school name review as they are combining into one school. So part of that process, we'll be reviewing the names of those schools to see whether they'll retain the name that they have or take on a new name through that process. Because we know we can host public comment now. The holdup that we had before, we just weren't sure how the technology was going to work And now we know we have a process for allowing people to speak to the committee. So we'll be doing that. And we'll be watching that closely because I also want to get the Sutherland Middle School name review process up and moving again. So both of those things are moving back toward the front burner. And I just thought the board would want to know about it. I also wanted to ask Mr. Jaramillo just discuss our recent survey that we did very quickly.\nunknownspeaker: Thank you, Superintendent Haas. Let me say first on the public comment, before every school board meeting, actually the day before, and then the day of, we post on the website, the homepage, the public comment option, and then we also post it on social media. But I think John's suggestion to add it into his email communication that goes to all families is a great idea, and we'll do that as well. Regarding the survey, as many of you know, the plan was to post a community opinion survey last week on the five budget priorities that were discussed at the school board meeting last Thursday. And the survey was posted late Friday. Now, we do lots of surveys, particularly on budget topics. And we generally get between 1,000 and 1,500 responses and consider that to be a pretty good response. Last week on Saturday and Sunday, which are not ideal days usually for public comment, we got 2,000 responses to the budget survey. So we exceeded what normally takes us a week or two weeks to get to. We got to that on Sunday. We're now at over 3,300 responses to the survey, which is just a phenomenal feedback from the public. We have several categories in which people can identify themselves in responding to the survey. The largest category of respondents or participants have been parents, about 40% of our responses have come from parents, 26% have come from students, and then 25% from employees and 8% from community members. We've seen some strong responses in the last couple of days, particularly from students weighing in on the various priorities. I think Maya is going to reference the survey in her presentation a little bit later this evening. But in general, the overwhelming, in terms of levels of support, the overwhelming choice of the people who are responding to the survey is you're strongly supporting student learning as a budget priority. And a little bit behind that, not far behind that, doing what we can to keep current employees employed and protecting their positions. And also ranking high was equity, which is, I think it's the highest support we've seen for equity in these public opinion surveys in a number of years. So I think that's all a pretty impressive response from our community.\njonnoalcaro: Thank you, Mr. Jeremiah. Dr. Haas, do you have any other announcements?\nunknownspeaker: I do not have any other announcements. Thank you, Mr. O'Connor. Thank you. Dr. Acuff, do you have an announcement for us tonight?

No, I did. We just presented as a range, but that's the where the number is calculated from\njonnoalcaro: Just a couple of quick comments. One comment, one question. I think that one of the great things that has been managed by the division is the health care costs. Because our brethren in Charlottesville schools are having their health insurance premiums grow by double digits in their budget this year. And for us to keep it steady for two years in a row is terrific. It's really good management of the reserves. And I thank you for that. One nit-nit question goes back to what was to be funded with EDEP, and I understand that that is not happening. The one question I have, though, is that they were paying about $85,000 or $87,000 to the division every year, and that had been taken back or given back under the 21 budget. Is that still the case or will they continue to submit payments from their revenues? The way this scenario is built is that what they've done in FY20 would continue.\nrosalynschmitt: So they would transfer that $87,000. If you wanted to eliminate it, we would have to make $87,000 cuts somewhere on the school fund.\njonnoalcaro: Sure, I understand. I'm just, I was just wanting to know what is. And so, okay. Okay.

You know, another alternative could be to front load and have a special meeting to make the recommendation the week before the 14th. It would still give a considerable a considerably large amount of time to pass between yesterday and when we would firm things up for recommendation to the board. It would also allow for Dr. McLaughlin and his team to put together a very concrete explanation of what stage four would look like for the December meeting. So it'd be really clear to everyone. We could then address questions and get feedback to continue to improve it. If we had a meeting on January 7th with that being the only Agenda item, it would be after the winter break. So people would be back in town to attend to it. And then we could do that. And then the next week, the board could act on it. That's another alternative. That's a compromise between the two concerns. Because if we were able to have a decision on the 14th, and all this is supposing that we would recommend stage four, I want to reiterate what Dr. McLaughlin said is that that's not a foregone conclusion. If we did do that, it would give us still a fair amount of time to get things in order to start on the semester break.<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\ndavidoberg:",

Now, moving forward, I did notice that one of the key metrics presented indicated that only about half of our students are currently engaged in live online sessions regularly.

That's that's I'll be honest, that's kind of a moving target. One of the things that we know is there are multiple ways that people are getting the vaccine. One is through our local clinics and we're we're hoping to be able to one of our Albemarle County clinics. We've done our first one. We're hoping to be able to do a second one. We've been working with the Blue Ridge Health District, and that is all dependent on the available vaccine. They also are vaccinating people at the Kmart tent through the Blue Ridge Health District, and they're working on some other partnerships. And so, unfortunately, we don't have hard numbers on that. I don't know if Ryan can give us a little bit better sense of what's going on with that.\nryanmckay: So just to provide a little context, we were notified, I believe, two weeks ago that our weekly allotment for vaccine is 2850. That's for the entire health district. So if a primary care provider, a pharmacy or even one of our hospitals wants to order a vaccine, it has to come from that 2850 allotment, which has to cover our entire district. So right now there is scarce availability for the vaccine and we need to spread that vaccine in a way that's most equitable to our entire community and so it makes it difficult to sort of carve out large chunks of numbers for individuals who receive the vaccine. Based on our current schedule, those that have an appointment to get vaccinated are all in February at this point. We are trying to expand to the extent possible, and when we do, we'll make options available for K-12 educators, including those in Elmoral County, to access either by providing enough vaccine where they can operate that site again at Charlottesville High School in tandem with Charlottesville City Schools, and the Regional Emergency Operations Center at our Kmart location or in hopefully the near future at the Big Lots location that is operated by UVA Health.

One of the things that is difficult with all of this is all of the information needs to be reported by the employee to let us know what's going on. Right now, our principals and our department supervisors are working to collect that data. That's what you saw tonight, a partial collection of that. We've asked our employees, number 1, if they plan to have the vaccine. Then we also ask them a couple of questions about whether or not they've had it. Have they had their first or second dose? Do they have an appointment already scheduled and are they unable to schedule an appointment? at this time. And then we ask our principals and our supervisors to identify what the work is that those people are doing now. Our first prioritization as we went through the clinic at Charlottesville High School a couple of weekends back was we wanted to make sure that we were first inviting those that were in person with students during stage three. And what we're doing now with the information we have We'll continue that prioritization to get all of those people in stage three in person vaccinated first, or the opportunity to vaccinate first, and also roll in the stage four people as well. And that way, we are making sure that we're focusing first on those people that are directly working with our students. It crosses all of our schools and departments. So we are looking for that from our, our bus from our bus drivers to our teachers to our teaching assistants, our school based administrators, and so you know we're hopeful that we will make sure that those who are I'm going to back up. We know that there is a great need and a great desire for vaccine from all of our staff members or many of our staff members, but we are trying to work to make sure that those who will have the most interaction with students have that opportunity early on.<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\ndavidoberg:",

As we did moving from stage two to stage three, the schools will set up town halls for parents to work, to hear what stage four will look like and what it looks like in their school and transportation and all the different pieces that come with starting a school year for them coming into the buildings. and we will offer students that same kind of opportunity.

Obviously, I can't get down to that close of a level. I would love to. I can tell you a couple of things that the studies have been able to link to is there has been ones that have been able to survey the kids have found that the significant disruption in their lives that has occurred has been a big issue for the eating disorders and the anxiety and depression. I can't speak obviously to the suicidal ideations and the suicide attempts as whether that's been predominantly just from a lack of in person we clearly know that code is a general rule has been incredibly disruptive, you know, to this kid's age age group is a general rule. And so the only thing that I know that the studies have kind of borne out a little bit and what we've at least seen locally when you talk to the providers around here is that the biggest source of frustration and the biggest source of issues with the anxiety and depression, the eating disorders has been the lack of face-to-face instruction and just the lack of socialization that comes with school. Thank you. That helps me.\nangelpilkey: I'm not sure who to address this question to, but speaking to a bunch of students, they're wondering if and how they can change their plan from going to virtual or hybrid if they feel the need to. Because I know a lot of students have decided that, hey, I think I'm actually going to try out the hybrid version that I've talked to, and they're wondering if and how they can do that.\nunknownspeaker: They need to contact their principal. but is that something that's possible? It is possible.\ndebbiecollins: It will take us some, depending on the situation, it may take us some time. If transportation is needed, that's a set of circumstances that would have to be put into the mix. The other pieces for elementary schools, some of it is around space. So if the classroom has 10 children in it already, we have to think about how we would expand the classroom spaces to accommodate the students. Having said that, that's all the conversations that the principals have been having around making decisions and planning for students to come in. We anticipate that more students will become hybrid than are virtual at this point.

All right. Good evening, board members. I believe board member Page and board member Alcaro. Thank you for being with us tonight. So we'll be engaging in this three levels of text protocol. And if you'll bear with me for one moment, I'm going to just put that slide back up on the screen. All right. And share screen. And let's make it a little bit bigger for you. Oops, that's the wrong button, I apologize. Slideshow, presenter view. There we go. I think I'm still on the wrong button, I'm sorry.\nunknownspeaker: I think you're good.\ndanreddng: Now we're good. All right. So we're going to go through this protocol and in this will take the first five minutes and you'll read the first section of the reports to yourself. And that's the recruitment selection and retention for classified staff. It's pages 22 through 30 of the report. We'll each read that silently. I'll set a timer. And then while you're reading that, look for something that stands out to you that you'll want to talk with the group in this breakout about. Each board member will have three minutes to read that section, that part of the passage aloud, and then share their thoughts and interpretation about that part of the passage and what that might have as implications for the work of HR. And then in the last two minutes, we can respond to what was shared. We'll repeat that for the same selection for the other board member.

The things that grabbed me in here were the retention rate, and I see that the retention rate is kind of steady in the 70 to 80%. But I think that's still a 24% departure rate is high. And I'm noticing that the retirements have jumped up each of the last three years. And so we're now we're five percentage points above where we were back in 17, 18. And I'd love to know some of the reasons behind it. I mean, I saw in here that through exit surveys, the main reasons for Leaving the job was personal moving from the area retirement 13% just seems like a big number. And I'm not, I'm not saying that people shouldn't be retiring when they're wanting to retire, you know, but I wonder if there are some retirements that people are doing that might be a little bit early. And, but obviously the one that I think you all are probably paying attention to is the third one with the job related issues, dissatisfaction with policies, practices, et cetera. And so for a group that is so important to our everyday existence and the wellbeing of our students, Those are the three things, whether it's the retention rate, the retirement rate, and the factors that were given during the exit surveys. Thank you.\nunknownspeaker: Did I hit three minutes? You're well under, actually. What kinds of implications might you see in the work of HR based on that thinking?\njonnoalcaro: Well, I think it's, and by the way, I'm very happy with the new HR situation. And I think it allows to dig deeper into some of these things that in the past, and no negative to the past, I'm not saying that, they may not have had the opportunity to really get down into dealing more closely with all of our employees, and specifically in this case, the classified staff. And I don't know if you are going to be having more and more people going out into the field. you know, to talk and have, you know, meetings in schools and other buildings, to sit down and talk with the nurses and the food services people. But I think it's much along the lines of we want to know and we want to see each one of our students in our schools and there be a relationship. And I wanna make sure that we are seeing each of our employees, no matter what role they have. And so given that we're just focused on classified, I just wanna make sure that they're being seen, they're being listened to, they're being given an opportunity to vent in a safe environment. and that they're not worried about losing their job over expressing frustration.\ndunroking: All right.

Another point that resonated with me was how much we value diversity equity inclusion. It made me realize even further that we must prioritize creating welcoming environments throughout our entire system. I am excited about exploring different strategies to help us improve upon those areas mentioned earlier. In terms of the HR department,",
        "So yeah, thank you. Yeah, I wanted to respond to Dr. Alcaro's comments because I do agree with him wholeheartedly. Classified staff members play such critical roles in supporting student learning. They provide essential support functions throughout the district. We need to ensure that we continue working hard to recruit, retain, and develop our talented classified team members. Retention rates, as he mentioned, remain relatively stable around 75%, which means nearly 25% leave annually. That has significant impact on operations, continuity, and ultimately affects student experiences. He also highlighted the importance of understanding why folks choose to depart or retire earlier than expected. As we explore those reasons further, perhaps we can identify potential solutions to improve job satisfaction, address burn",
        "Thank you. So yes, thank you for your question. That makes sense. I am also concerned about the classification staff retention rates. One thing that struck me as interesting in terms of the survey results - or at least in the data provided today - was the fact that those who left due to job-related issues increased significantly between FY19-20 and FY21. Now granted, that time period includes COVID which certainly could've played a part in that increase. But nonetheless, I believe it does indicate something else is happening beyond simply pandemic fatigue. So my concern is that maybe we need to delve even further into understanding why classified staff feel compelled to leave us because of job-related concerns. Maybe it has nothing to do with pay; perhaps it relates to"

The things that grabbed me in here were the retention rate, and I see that the retention rate is kind of steady in the 70 to 80%. But I think that's still a 24% departure rate is high. And I'm noticing that the retirements have jumped up each of the last three years. And so we're now we're five percentage points above where we were back in 17, 18.

The other piece that jumps out to me though, especially considering where they are currently serving within their careers, is succession planning. We should probably take a closer look at mentoring programs, particularly for classified staff, making certain that we aren't caught off guard when someone retires unexpectedly. And finally, with regards to employee morale, ensuring that people feel valued, appreciated, and supported throughout their tenure here. Otherwise, why stick",

Now, the ones who are leaving early, which I understand why they do, but sometimes they have to train their replacements. If we don't plan ahead, we'll find ourselves scrambling later on.",

It seems like we're seeing an upward trend in retirements lately, which isn't surprising given their ages, but I do worry about replacing them since recruiting qualified candidates has become increasingly difficult. We should consider offering incentives such as early retirement packages or training opportunities for younger staff members to take over these roles once they open up. This way, we'll ensure continuity within departments while giving newer staff members room to grow professionally. Plus, incentivizing longer-serving staff members to stay will help maintain stability throughout the district during uncertain times."

The numbers jumped out at me - an average rate over the past three years being around 14%. So, my question was going back to something else Ms. Brown said earlier today, regarding her experience from another district. Have there been studies done comparing teacher retention between smaller districts versus larger ones because we keep hearing about the bigger districts having higher pay scales but maybe they also lose more people too. So does size make a difference in terms of retaining educators long-term?",
        "Okay, thank you. Well, actually, there were several passages that caught my attention but since they had already been discussed somewhat earlier today was on page 32 under retention strategies where they talked about employee recognition programs. And then further down below that, they also talk about flexible scheduling work-life balance opportunities, professional development support, and tuition reimbursement. And it seems to me these kinds of items could play an awful lot more importance than salary alone. Now maybe not always, but certainly for many people, especially younger professionals.",
        "Well, actually, the thing that caught my eye was under employee feedback, where they were talking about feeling valued and appreciated. The last sentence says \"Employee appreciation events should continue.\" Now, I'm wondering whether there could be more specificity around exactly what kind of event because we had something similar over at the high school level last year, but it didn't seem to get much participation from teachers. So maybe having more specific ideas would help improve that particular area."

We had Kate, Elizabeth and Dr. Kaiser in our group, and we had a robust discussion and I may miss some of the points so Kate and Elizabeth, please feel free to jump in. So we were looking at administrators in particular. And we talked about the building up of administrators, nurturing them. And that was typically seen, like that was mostly seen as a good thing, but with a caution that when you look at the demographics of the administrators, how completely different they are from both the teachers and classified demographics. where mostly you're seeing like 72, 73% of teachers and classified staff, 77% are women, but only 53% of the administrators are women. So the question is, okay, so who is getting nurtured and brought up into the, to be administrators? The other question is the percentage of administrators who are internal and for the information that we have, it looks like about 72% of the administrative changes that happened in that year that was captured were internal. So promotions or transfers and then the other 1828%. Just doing quick math were external and so we're a school division that is really looking to make big changes in some of the you know, inequitable outcomes that we've seen. And I, I think that it can be hard sometimes to do that with so much of internal churn of the same sort of people. So that was just a concern that was brought up. We also had good discussions about substitutes and the support that we're providing with them. And it was encouraging to see that there a part of the big HR plan. So we're very happy to see that because they're a very important part of our ecosystem as we see more and more. And then we talked about how important it is to have the experience of teachers of color, but also we were interested in knowing more about the experiences of all employees of color Um, and especially since we, as an organization have a lot of like micro climates. So, um, you know, different schools might have different, I mean, certainly they do have different climates and different experiences for people of color.

Then, write what 'judyle' would say next in the conversation.<|eot_id|>\n\n<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nunknownspeaker: Next, we'll discuss expenditures.\nmayakumazawa: Here's a look at our total school fund expenditures and what type of expenses they cover. Throughout the book, you will see that about 86% of our expenditures cover compensation and benefits. Here's how that looks on a more granular level. Almost 60% of the budget is spent on salaries,\nunknownspeaker: followed by VRS, health insurance, and FICO.\nmayakumazawa: The assumptions used for salaries and benefits are detailed in section C of the budget book, beginning on page C12. Non-compensation and benefits expenses make up only 14% of the budget, and they include mostly departmental costs, such as transfers to other funds, including a transfer to local government, school bus fuel, and utility maintenance and lease costs at our schools. We show expenditures in various ways represented by the expenditure sections in the budget book. Section D comprises school-based budgets. These are costs that can be directly tied to individual schools. Examples include principals, teachers, and custodians. Section E comprises department-based budgets. These are costs that cannot be directly tied to individual schools. Examples of these are bus drivers and maintenance. Finally, section F contains our SEP. Special revenue funds are self-sustaining, meaning that revenues and expenditures must balance within each individual fund. Examples include fee-based programs whereby user fees are set to ensure expenditures are covered, or grant programs whereby the expenditures budgeted may not exceed the grant revenue that is projected. We will first focus on Section D, school-based budgets. Because these expenses can be directly linked to specific schools, we show our school-based budgets by school location. You will see that throughout the section, there are two pages dedicated to each school and a detailed breakdown by expense type and functional area. In addition, these pages show the FTE allocations to each school. That's what makes up more than 90% of the budgets. As you might expect, budgets are largely driven by projected enrollment. The larger the school, the higher the FTE count and the larger the budget. How exactly are the school-based budgets determined? Enrollment and demographics form the base of the budget. Using these assumptions, we apply established staffing standards to the budget book. The resulting FTEs assigned are shown beginning on page G18. These FTEs make up, on average, about 94% of a school-based budget. The remaining 6% of the budget is for supplemental pay such as long-term substitute pay and operating budgets, which are managed by principals. Here's a chart that provides a breakdown of per-pupil expenditures by school. This is simply a calculation of the total FY23 school-based budget divided by the projected K-12 enrollment of each school. Per-pupil budgets, as you can see, range between $10,000 and $15,000. These numbers will differ from division-wide per-pupil amounts since departmental costs are not included here. The red line in the middle corresponds to the right axis and shows the total budget amounts. In general, schools that are smaller tend to have higher per-pupil costs, and schools that are larger tend to have lower per-pupil costs. In addition, the demographics of the school play an important role when looking at per pupil expenditures. I will pause here to see if you have any questions about expenditures or school-based expenditures in particular.\nunknownspeaker: Ms. Kumasawa, again, did you say the red line represented?\nmayakumazawa: That shows the actual total of the budget. So the total budget for Albemarle, for instance, is the highest, and that's why there's a peak there. It's the same data as two slides prior, that red line.<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\njudyle:",

Can you elaborate on how we account for these demographic differences in determining per-pupil expenditures? For example, do we provide additional resources for schools with higher percentages of students receiving free or reduced-price lunch, English language learners, or special education services? And if so, how does that impact their overall per-pupil allocation?",

We continued to project an increase in FY21 to reflect the previous year's increase, but that was a year of our largest decline due to the pandemic. As we build towards FY23, we are projecting an increase in actual enrollment as represented by the orange dotted line, but a decrease in budget to budget enrollment as represented by the blue dotted line. We believe that this projection represents growth due to growing development in the county and students returning back to our schools. However, the reality is that homeschooling is increasing and had been before the pandemic and we're using this current year's enrollment as a new baseline. Here, packed onto one slide, are the changes in budget due to enrollment and demographics, with the exception of special education, which will be presented later. The reason why this is shown all together is because these items are related and cannot always be distinguished from each other. First, the budget-to-budget enrollment change. The decreasing enrollment results in 29.4 fewer FTEs for the division based on our current staffing standards. Other smaller changes include a slight reduction due to the Crozet redistricting study that was approved, a modest increase in world languages staffing, and small increases in Center One and ESOL staffing. These increases are offset by the elimination of contingency FTEs that were budgeted in the FY22 budget. After these enrollment and demographic changes, we are proposing to maintain the level of staffing that we have in our schools this year by reducing our staffing ratios by one student. In doing so, we would be adding back the approximately 30 FTEs that are reduced in the top portion of this table. This net change results in an approximately zero FTE change from budget to budget in this category. Dr. Haas presented this class size reduction proposal and the draft funding requests. And I'm here to take any questions that you have about this or other enrollment and demographic changes.<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\njudyle:",

Last month, we had the wonderful opportunity to hear from Baker Butler educators about the nationally recognized gains they have made in closing the achievement gap at their school. Tonight we're focusing on yet another opportunity gap in our schools and in schools across our nation, the percentage of students of color who enter STEM related fields. 45 years ago, an organization was established to address this issue, the National Society of Black Engineers. Its mission was ambitious and vital to the collective prosperity of every community in the United States. The society was organized to promote academic excellence, provide scholarships, train leaders, and expand access to professional careers. A few years ago, the society broadened its charter to include high school chapters, and one of the first chapters in Central Virginia was established at Albemarle High School. Membership is open to students from all of our middle school and high schools, regardless of race or ethnicity. Students from Greer, Burley, and soon Walton are members and students are members, and students from UVA serve as mentors. There currently are 25 students in our local chapter, and more than 100 students have had their lives changed by this extraordinary program. Many have gone on to earn engineering degrees at the university level. The driving, guiding, determined light for these young people continues to be Ms. Pearl Early, Albemarle High School student support specialist. A characteristic of this program is its strong emphasis on project-based learning. Students learn how to research, design, experiment with, and refine solutions that can improve our lives. A natural topic this year is COVID-19, and true to form, students have come up with an ingenious approach to protecting public health. I understand that the nature of this development process is that it can take up to two years, but our students have field-tested their invention within seven months. I'd like to ask Ms. Early to tell us a little more about the journey of her students over these past seven years, and to introduce us to today's superstars who will tell us about their new discovery.

What's the impact? What's going on specifically in Charlottesville? I hope that answers your question. Thank you. Other questions from the board? I would just like to ask, because I sat in on the seat meeting last spring, and I thought it was absolutely terrific. And I thought the three speakers from the community were outstanding. Have there been other, I mean, I know you're talking about their involvement moving forward. Have they been involved with the with the team and in the meantime, in the last four or five months. So the state took a break over the summer and we allowed them some time to readjust to schedules. And so they picked up their meetings this fall. Since then, they continue to meet regularly. And they're already just kind of at this point, they're working towards their plans for the spring. So that's really been their attention and where they've been focusing their attention this fall. has been on the plans for the spring. And so that includes for the public awareness campaign, but also one thing that came up over the summer was back in June, they had some ideas about how they can support their peers in making reporting acts of racism and how to use social media, or rather, our anonymous alert app. And so that is one thing that they will be working on with Dr. King is thinking about how to create some tutorials. So that's really where some of their work has been from June and where they are now. Terrific. Thank you very much. Are there other questions? Yeah, just to follow up on that about the anonymous alerts app. What would you say the status is now of usage of that? I would have to check in with with Dr. King just to see what has been reported this fall. But one thing that we learned from the young people was just that, you know, not everyone knows how to use the app. The one thing I would just caution us is that, you know, the app even then when you report it, there are different layers, right, in terms of like the detail, the level of detail. And so we wouldn't necessarily want to solely rely on this app to report acts of racism and to follow up. But one thing that the students did talk about was it's one thing when they're learning about this from their peers.

We've learned a lot about the immune system in relation to the COVID vaccine, significantly just in the last four to six weeks or so. You've seen some trials come out also with the Johnson & Johnson and Novavax vaccine, which the Johnson & Johnson is a single dose vaccine. There's a very specific reason that the Pfizer and the Moderna were put out as two-dose vaccines, and that was because initial studies suggested that they were probably about 75% to 80% effective after the first shot. And I remind you that we set the bar initially through the FDA at 50%. If we get 50% effective excuse me, 50% efficacy of a vaccine within any season, we're otherwise pleased, especially for a virus like this that spreads exponentially, that can have significant effects on its ability to protect somebody. The reason, though, that you did not see it stop at one shot and it go as a two-dose vaccine was purely because they found that the efficacy raised up to around 90% to 95% and 100% for preventing severe disease once you got that second dose. But that is why the FDA ended up approving it. And so while we obviously can't tell somebody, oh, you're fine, don't ever get the second, you're almost a whole way there. People should take solace in the fact that if they have one dose of the vaccine, that they've already begun the significant issue of developing immunity to it. And so I would encourage, and I've encouraged a lot of people, again, a lot of the teachers that asked me that very exact question last Friday when I was doing vaccines there, as I said, this is a big step. The second one is the one that seems to secure the memory response a little bit better. One just quick follow-up question is, with the first shot, is there still or is there a two-week period before that really takes effect as it is with the second shot? We think that you've probably managed to generate an immune response so that you actually have circulating antibodies sometime around that seven to 10-day mark after the first shot. And so that seems to be kind of the line in the sand that a lot of us that a lot of us are utilizing. With that being said, I know you guys have all seen also that the recommendation is still going to be that the vaccine is just one layer of mitigation and that even after people are fully vaccinated. We don't know we know that it is a good way to prevent people from beginning severe illness. we have no idea about its ability to prevent people from spreading the disease. And that's why you're not going to be seeing vaccination programs as part of mitigation strategies for large organizations because you're, you know, supplant things like mask wearing and physical distancing and all of the other information. And so I would say the vaccine as a general rule is that we excuse me, I apologize, the vaccine is a general rule for us, is a very personal decision of allowing, making sure that we can promise somebody is, or not promise, but get close to that, that somebody is not going to individually become sick. But I would encourage you not to think of the vaccine as a way to prevent spread within a school. We have absolutely no idea its ability to prevent that. And that's why all the data that I presented earlier is without vaccination, and I think needs to be kind of continued to be kept in that context. For an individual teacher, that's a different story. If we're concerned about individual at-risk people, the vaccine can make a noticeable, noticeable difference. But we do not know its ability to help prevent spread through schools. And that's why you will not see it as part of mitigation strategies. Thank you.<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\njudyle:",

      "true_completion": " I have a couple questions about virtual learning. First, I want to say I do appreciate all of the work and planning that's gone into this. I know that we're not dealing with unlimited resources and we have to make a lot of really difficult decisions to educate 14,000 students. So I really appreciate all the work that staff has done and definitely the people on the ground who are doing every day. So I really appreciate that. I just have a concern about the equity between the virtual learning and the hybrid learning. Also because we know nationally and locally that more of our black and brown families are choosing that. So I just want to make sure that we have some assurances. It will be important to me that we have some assurances that that is robust for my decision making. Firstly, I have a question about intervention services. And I think a way for me to be able to get my head around this is to know how many students will lose intervention services in stage four as it is now. And I know that you don't have those numbers ready, but that's something that I would like to know next week. Also, I would like to know how instructional hours for the hybrid learners will compare with the instructional hours of the virtual learners in K-3, or pre-K-3, I guess, for the four-day-a-week students. I assume that the 4-5, 4-12, I guess, would be the same. But I just would like to know the difference, if there is any difference between the instructional time for those youngest learners. And then I also would like to know how if or how meal services will be affected. For the students who are at home. And then on a different note, I don't know if this is something that Ross considers or we consider how this works. But I wonder if we should be looking at updated mask guidance, given that the new variant is likely coming or here. I know that we've all read a lot in the news about how the single cloth masks are just not as effective now against that. So that's just something I guess I'll throw out there.",

Saying as people get more comfortable, hey, look, it's been three weeks and I don't have any issues. Maybe I want to go back to school. I think that that may just be, that may be, I just hope we're prepared for that.\nunknownspeaker: And that change could go either way, right? What about if the person is in and decides to go to virtual? How long is the wait time for that?\ndebbiecollins: That tends to be able to happen faster because the logistics aren't involved of coming to school and getting a seat, if you will, in a classroom. Now, having said that, we do know that there may be some virtual classrooms that may be on the high side, especially in some of the elementary schools. The middle and high school, we don't see that as a problem around going from hybrid to virtual.\nellenosborne: Early on, we told teachers that they would not be required to be teach both virtually and in person, is that still the case?\ndebbiecollins: Actually, I don't know that we told teachers that we told them we would work to try to offset that. And the principals have been working to offset that. And as we anticipated, some courses are easier to have that happen than others. English courses, some math courses are easier to accommodate that because if you think about a schedule of a ninth grader, in an English class first block, I might have three English nine teachers during that block so that I can move students around to accommodate hybrid or virtual. But if BC calculus is only offered one time during the day, then the likelihood of that teacher of us being able to offer a virtual divorced from a hybrid is less likely. Now, having said that, we are talking about looking across the division to perhaps accommodate that. The principals have been working very closely with the teachers to try to work through this and figure this piece out. The other thing I would say is, surprisingly to me, quite honestly, as teachers have talked about it, many of them have said, I would prefer to do hybrid and virtual together. This is something that the departments have been talking through, and the principals are very much aware of the workload.\ngrahampaige: Okay, Ms. Collins, I think someone mentioned it, but all of the people who had their request denied, the principals have had a conference already with those people to explain why it was denied, right?\ndebbiecollins: Yes, but I think Dr. Kaiser might be in a better position to answer that from a human resources perspective.\nclarekeiser: And the answer to that is yes. They and one of the things that I know that they many of them talked about is just, you know, helping them understand the mitigation strategies for some of the teachers. They haven't been in the school since since March. And so, you know, encouraging them to come in, see the mitigation strategies in action, kind of kind of make that first step into the school, I think, is a really important piece. And and one of the things that I know about our principals is they have very, very good and strong relationships with their staff. And we know that they can talk to them and help calm and ease their nerves. I think the fact that we have not seen a number of people say, no, I just can't do this. I think that's an indication that while they are uncomfortable, and I don't want to in any way minimize that. We know that we have a number of people that are uncomfortable coming back into school.

Are there some classes that we really can't do either way? I'm thinking of things along drama or some of the music classes. Are they possible?\ndeboracollin: They are possible. especially with students being able to come in the building some of the time. One of the things we learned from our fine arts teachers and our visual and fine arts teachers is they were able to figure out how to do some of the work virtually. So I think that's part of the challenge of what will be for teachers is what do I need to have students in the building for? or hands-on for, or what resources do I need to hand them as they're going home that makes the work in our course, the standards that we set for the course, accessible and attainable for students. So I think that's part of the conversation, the ongoing teacher development that will take place. But you're right, some of it might be easier than others.\ndavidoberg: My daughter took drama, and I got to tell you, some of the stuff they did virtually was really cool. I was really impressed by some of the good stuff they got to do.\nunknownspeaker: That's good to hear. Our teachers are amazingly creative.\nmatthewhaas: I've heard some great stories from students and families about the creativity of the teachers and how they figured out. Some of the students have had some of the best experiences they've ever had during this time. And many students really adjusted well to a different format for school. It was almost like a break that they needed. So one of the challenges that we talk about at our level is as we make these kinds of plans, we have to leave enough room for the creativity of our teachers, our families, and our students to be part of the idea generating process and the iteration of what a class is gonna look like because that's where engagement comes from. planning this out with enough detail to make sure everyone is safe and that everyone will be treated fairly and have the best access that they can is our job. And then allowing that level of creativity to come in from the school level principals, the teachers, and the families and students, that's where you get the engagement.\nunknownspeaker: Just one more question for me. How have we been doing with our English language learners? And do we have anything additional planned for the fall?\ndeboracollin: One of the things this kind of work allows us to do, if we have secondary students and not all the students are in the building at the same time, there could be groups of students that could come in every day. So English language learners could come in every day based on the kinds of scheduling we're looking at. They have been identified as high-risk learners. And all the task force documents from DOE, our task force, they're identified as a priority. So we would try to get them into school buildings as much as possible for as many days during the week as we could. So those become priorities for us. And as we start thinking about how we schedule, we look to those kind of principles, if you will, to help us decide.<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\njudyle:",

This is not, starting before Labor Day is not the norm by any means.

And whereas the school board has responded to the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, providing students and staff members with the technology and resources necessary to ensure the efficient delivery of instruction virtually and in person. And whereas the school board has a substantial public interest in protecting the health and safety of its students, staff and community, and ensuring that the school division can provide staff and students with a safe and effective educational environment that supports student achievement. And whereas school division staff at all levels are essential to the day-to-day operations of the school division and are responsible for the thorough and efficient education of all students and their social and emotional well-being. And whereas a surge of COVID-19 cases has recently occurred, largely resulting from the Delta variant, also known as B.1.617.2, a highly transmissible virus that impacts individuals regardless of age, And whereas over 90% of COVID-19 infections are currently occurring in individuals who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19. And whereas the overwhelming scientific evidence has established that the vaccines authorized by the FDA for emergency use are safe and effective. and recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for all individuals except children under 12 years of age and certain others, and whereas the school board has the responsibility to prevent the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 infections in its schools and other facilities, and whereas the Director of Emergency Management for the County of Albemarle, Virginia has issued Order Number 21-3 pursuant to Virginia Code 44-146.21c, mandating vaccines, vaccinations, or periodic testing for COVID-19 for the employees of the County of Albemarle. Now, therefore, be it resolved that the school board finds that there exists a public health emergency that requires action to safeguard students and staff against the risks of infection, illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19. The school board adopts order number 21 dash three and will work in partnership with the county of Albemarle in the implementation of this order to control the spread of coven 19 in the school division and community. The administration of the school division is directed to develop procedures for the implementation of this resolution that are based upon order number 21-2 as modified to reflect the specific operations of the school division and school board policies, regulations, and code of conduct, and otherwise take all other actions necessary to carry out this mandate.
