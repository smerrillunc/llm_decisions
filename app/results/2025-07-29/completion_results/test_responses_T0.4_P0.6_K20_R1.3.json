We're working on a project to develop an AI-powered chatbot that helps people with disabilities navigate healthcare systems more easily.  Our goal is to create a conversational interface that can assist users in finding accessible providers, understanding their insurance coverage, and preparing for medical appointments. The idea came out of our own experiences as caregivers or individuals living with disabilities who've faced challenges navigating these complex systems. We conducted user research interviews with 20 participants across different disability types and found some common pain points around lack of accessibility information online, difficulty communicating needs to providers, and feeling overwhelmed by paperwork and administrative tasks. Based on those findings, we designed three main features for our",

Again, just doing the head math, it seems as though adding one FTE still puts us below the ratio that we were at before last year. Is that correct?\naurenmacle: So it should put us at the same ratio we were at the last year. It's just in terms of when we look at our ratio, the ratio of students to teacher varies from one to 20 for a student who's a newcomer, or one to 50 if they are in, say, a level four, have recently exited. And so when we look at the ratio, it kind of depends on the breakdown of the students at each school. I see.\njudyle: And so this will put us back to where we were before. Because I guess my question is,  just based on the numbers, it doesn't seem like it quite puts us back to that ratio. And I also wonder how successful that ratio was. Like, my question is, I guess, if we can measure the success of what the ratio has been in the past and what that looks like and fund appropriately for the ESOL population.\naurenmacle: So we can look at getting the WIDA data and specifically the growth data that the state looks at to track English learner progression and look at the different ratios and we can collect that and provide that to you all. Thank you.\nkateacuff: Ms. McLean, I don't know if this is a question for you or not. With respect to our community outreach, how does that work with our ESOL student families? or do we have any specialized outreach for these families?\naurenmacle: Absolutely, and so we employ a family engagement and student support liaison within the East Hall office who specifically works to ensure that our families are included and liaises with a lot of different departments and schools. For this reason, we also put on monthly multilingual family tech nights where we support our families in learning new strategies and partner with kind of the different departments to find more opportunities to engage our English learner families in terms of getting into the community with them.\nunknownspeaker: Thank you.<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nellenosborne:",

And I would like to respectfully request that we do so.  I think there's a lot that could be said about it and probably more eloquently by some of our other board members. But just from my role as an assistant city attorney, I can say that I don't think we're escaping any kind of liability by not taking action when we already effectively are banning it through our superintendent. And we're opening ourself up to a lot of optics problems and beyond optics.  We're sending a message to our students. It's really easy to resolve since we already are not allowing students to wear Confederate imagery. And I think it's time that we make a resolution and move on. So I don't think we can make a motion at this meeting for something like that, although I am confused because we did make a motion for the holiday at the beginning.

For some of them, it may be like starting school for the very first time.  these large gaps, when you think about when they come back in August after three months away, and that's three months that we anticipated and where their lives can go on as normal, we can expect to see some behavioral issues, some definitely executive function issues, getting back into the schedule, back into listening and following directions and planning to get their assignments done and working with teachers. We just need to know that's coming so that our teachers  and our staff are not surprised.\nkevinkirst: Well, can I have a question for Kevin too? Just to reiterate, when we make the changes with PrEP, our students will not be affected adversely at all. services that PrEP is now providing for us will be provided in-house, correct?  Yes, so the yes the to answer that, because I don't want to say any effect it's all services are level like we are not cutting services we are not pulling away from services on the issue would be right like value and. We'll use Parent Resource Center. Is that as good as it was at the Piedmont Regional Education Program? That's different. Like we will provide the service, but that, you know, the value added pieces is what I'm looking to meet and enhance. But the level of service by no means is being decreased.

If we're able to establish some consistency across our schools for what happens during instructional time, which includes no phones, right now, like he said, once these current sixth-graders leave us, every student entering into seventh grade next year has already been told by their friends, \"Hey, don't bring your phone.\" It becomes culturalized within two years. We've got buy-in from everyone involved. The other thing too is that even though we may start small, let's say starting with the ninth-grade class, eventually over four years, we'd also see significant changes throughout the entire district. That might make sense.  I'm glad someone brought up the idea of establishing consistent expectations around",

If we're trying to teach these children how to behave responsibly without having some kind of external control mechanism, isn't taking away phones from our most vulnerable population counterproductive?  I don't understand why we wouldn't want to give every student an opportunity for self-regulation practice. And my second point is that while we may see short-term gains by removing devices, aren't we also potentially creating long term problems where people lack social skills, emotional intelligence, digital citizenship, etc.? We should focus instead on teaching responsible use rather than prohibition. We need to prepare students better for life outside of schools which includes technology usage. Prohibition"

There may be certain restrictions placed upon how these funds can be used based on their source. For example, federal funding has specific requirements about how it must be spent. State funding also comes with strings attached. And local bond issues often come with voter-approved language specifying exactly where the proceeds will go.

That's that's I'll be honest, that's kind of a moving target. One of the things that we know is there are multiple ways that people are getting the vaccine. One is through our local clinics and we're we're hoping to be able to one of our Albemarle County clinics. We've done our first one. We're hoping to be able to do a second one.  We've been working with the Blue Ridge Health District, and that is all dependent on the available vaccine. They also are vaccinating people at the Kmart tent through the Blue Ridge Health District, and they're working on some other partnerships. And so, unfortunately, we don't have hard numbers on that. I don't know if Ryan can give us a little bit better sense of what's going on with that.\nryanmckay: So just to provide a little context, we were notified, I believe, two weeks ago that our weekly allotment for vaccine is 2850. That's for the entire health district. So if a primary care provider, a pharmacy or even one of our hospitals wants to order a vaccine, it has to come from that 2850 allotment, which has to cover our entire district.  So right now there is scarce availability for the vaccine and we need to spread that vaccine in a way that's most equitable to our entire community and so it makes it difficult to sort of carve out large chunks of numbers for individuals who receive the vaccine.  Based on our current schedule, those that have an appointment to get vaccinated are all in February at this point. We are trying to expand to the extent possible, and when we do, we'll make options available for K-12 educators, including those in Elmoral County, to access either by providing enough vaccine where they can operate that site again at Charlottesville High School in tandem with Charlottesville City Schools,  and the Regional Emergency Operations Center at our Kmart location or in hopefully the near future at the Big Lots location that is operated by UVA Health.

What happens behind the scenes though is that different entities like pharmacies, healthcare providers, etc., request allocations based upon their capacity to administer them.

Wouldn't kids need to choose between attending extended schooling versus participating in their sports teams or band camps or whatever else happens during the summer months?  That makes sense. debora collins: That's true. You know, when we talk about extending the school year, what we meant by that was maybe starting earlier rather than ending later. But yes, absolutely right. Summer programming does become important for our families and especially for our low-income families where childcare becomes critical over the summertime. So perhaps instead of looking at extending into June, July, August",
        "Okay. Just real quick. One question and then another comment. My question was what happens with our support staff when they come back early because their contracts aren't necessarily tied to the teachers' contract.  And my comment is, I'm concerned about the equity issue here. You know, extending the school year sounds great until you realize that maybe only certain kids will take advantage of it. Maybe others won't have access to transportation or childcare during that time period. Or maybe families need summer break to earn money themselves. There are lots of reasons why people wouldn't participate. So while it seems good on paper, I worry about unintended consequences. Thanks.",

[inaudible] So my understanding was that when they did the survey with teachers and staff, most people said they didn't feel comfortable returning until August. Is that accurate?

We continued to project an increase in FY21 to reflect the previous year's increase, but that was a year of our largest decline due to the pandemic.  As we build towards FY23, we are projecting an increase in actual enrollment as represented by the orange dotted line, but a decrease in budget to budget enrollment as represented by the blue dotted line. We believe that this projection represents growth due to growing development in the county and students returning back to our schools. However, the reality is that homeschooling is increasing and had been before the pandemic  and we're using this current year's enrollment as a new baseline. Here, packed onto one slide, are the changes in budget due to enrollment and demographics, with the exception of special education, which will be presented later. The reason why this is shown all together is because these items are related and cannot always be distinguished from each other. First, the budget-to-budget enrollment change.  The decreasing enrollment results in 29.4 fewer FTEs for the division based on our current staffing standards. Other smaller changes include a slight reduction due to the Crozet redistricting study that was approved, a modest increase in world languages staffing, and small increases in Center One and ESOL staffing. These increases are offset by the elimination of contingency FTEs that were budgeted in the FY22 budget.  After these enrollment and demographic changes, we are proposing to maintain the level of staffing that we have in our schools this year by reducing our staffing ratios by one student. In doing so, we would be adding back the approximately 30 FTEs that are reduced in the top portion of this table. This net change results in an approximately zero FTE change from budget to budget in this category.  Dr. Haas presented this class size reduction proposal and the draft funding requests.

We're looking at someone who has experience working with English Language Learners (ELLs) as well as knowledge around best practices supporting students with interrupted education backgrounds. Ideally they'll hold either ESL certification or bilingualism/multilingual skills themselves since many newcomers may not speak dominant languages spoken here locally. Additionally strong cultural competence is essential considering diverse refugee resettlement patterns within our district boundaries. We also want them familiarized with trauma-informed care principles because some students might carry past experiences requiring sensitive handling",

Can you explain how many more students do you expect will need these services based on your projections?  LourenaMcle: Ah yes certainly Judy thank you for asking! Based on current trends what we're seeing is approximately 25% growth year over year of newcomers entering into our system particularly within the urban ring area where they tend to settle initially upon arrival. So if we look at last years numbers when we had around 150 new arrivals by mid-year were already up to almost 190 just six months into this academic calendar which puts us well above pace from previous years.

Last month, we had the wonderful opportunity to hear from Baker Butler educators about the nationally recognized gains they have made in closing the achievement gap at their school.  Tonight we're focusing on yet another opportunity gap in our schools and in schools across our nation, the percentage of students of color who enter STEM related fields. 45 years ago, an organization was established to address this issue, the National Society of Black Engineers. Its mission was ambitious and vital to the collective prosperity of every community in the United States.  The society was organized to promote academic excellence, provide scholarships, train leaders, and expand access to professional careers. A few years ago, the society broadened its charter to include high school chapters, and one of the first chapters in Central Virginia was established at Albemarle High School. Membership is open to students from all of our middle school and high schools, regardless of race or ethnicity. Students from Greer, Burley, and soon Walton are members and students  are members, and students from UVA serve as mentors. There currently are 25 students in our local chapter, and more than 100 students have had their lives changed by this extraordinary program. Many have gone on to earn engineering degrees at the university level. The driving, guiding, determined light for these young people continues to be Ms. Pearl Early, Albemarle High School student support specialist.  A characteristic of this program is its strong emphasis on project-based learning. Students learn how to research, design, experiment with, and refine solutions that can improve our lives. A natural topic this year is COVID-19, and true to form, students have come up with an ingenious approach to protecting public health. I understand that the nature of this development process is that it can take up to two years, but our students have field-tested their invention within seven months.  I'd like to ask Ms. Early to tell us a little more about the journey of her students over these past seven years, and to introduce us to today's superstars who will tell us about their new discovery.

One was an internal reporting tool used within our institution which allows individuals who experience or witness incidents of bias or discrimination to confidentially submit reports through an online portal.  The second reference made later during the discussion involved another application called \"Anonymous Alerts\" - specifically designed for K-12 schools but also utilized at higher education institutions including ours. This particular platform enables users (students) to anonymously send tips regarding safety concerns such as bullying, harassment, substance abuse, etc., directly to school administrators via mobile devices.

There were concerns raised by various stakeholders including faculty staff and student groups regarding potential unintended consequences associated with implementing such a system without proper safeguards protocols training etcetera.

I know that we're not dealing with unlimited resources and we have to make a lot of really difficult decisions to educate 14,000 students. So I really appreciate all the work that staff has done and definitely the people on the ground who are doing every day. So I really appreciate that.  I just have a concern about the equity between the virtual learning and the hybrid learning. Also because we know nationally and locally that more of our black and brown families are choosing that. So I just want to make sure that we have some assurances. It will be important to me that we have some assurances that is robust for my decision making.  Firstly, I have a question about intervention services. And I think a way for me to be able to get my head around this is to know how many students will lose intervention services in stage four as it is now. And I know that you don't have those numbers ready, but that's something that I would like to know next week. Also, I would like to know how instructional hours for the hybrid learners will compare with the instructional hours  of the virtual learners in K-3, or pre-K-3, I guess, for the four-day-a-week students. I assume that the 4-5, 4-12, I guess, would be the same. But I just would like to know the difference, if there is any difference between the instructional time for those youngest learners.  And then I also would like to know how if or how meal services will be affected. For the students who are at home. And then on a different note, I don't know if this is something that  Ross considers or we consider how this works. But I wonder if we should be looking at updated mask guidance, given that the new variant is likely coming or here. I know that we've all read a lot in the news about how the single cloth masks are just not as effective now against that. So that's just something I guess I'll throw out there.",

Another possibility could also include training programs designed specifically for new employees so they'll feel more comfortable coming aboard here within Albemarle County Public Schools. That way, once again, there will be less likelihood of them leaving us after only being employed for short periods of time. One additional thought which came up during Dr. Haas' presentation last week has to do with mentorship opportunities where experienced individuals from various departments throughout ACPS could serve as mentors for newer hires. This type of program should help make these people feel welcome while providing support needed early on in their careers working with us. It seems pretty clear that",

Do they think someone coming behind them should take over what they're doing currently? In terms of training, mentoring, all sorts of things come up from that perspective. Another issue would probably relate back again to recruitment and hiring practices within the division itself. If these individuals were leaving us after so many years of service, did we make sure during that time period that we gave opportunities for professional development growth throughout their career path? Did we provide enough support systems along the way? Were any changes made by administration or school board members that caused dissatisfaction among employees leading towards early departure?

        "Well, first off, one concern could possibly be if there are people who were hired during those years where they're going to retire soon, what kind of training programs do we need to put together so that these individuals will stay long enough until their replacements come along? In addition, how many positions should we expect to lose over time due to retirees leaving us? That way, we'll better understand whether any changes must occur within certain departments. Also, since we already talked about teacher shortages earlier tonight, perhaps similar issues exist among support personnel such as bus drivers, custodians, food service workers, etcetera.

Stay interview being defined by having regular check-ins between managers and their team members to discuss job satisfaction, goals, concerns, ideas, et cetera. This seems like an excellent idea because sometimes when people leave jobs, employers don't find out why until after they have already gone away from them.

And I am happy to be able to speak to you to express my appreciation to you, the whole school board, the administration, everybody for upholding the current masking guidelines. Like everyone, I would be delighted for things to go back to COVID, pre-COVID normal. But we recognize that we aren't there yet.  I have four children. I have one at Western, one at Henley, and one at Brownsville. That's a lot of contact they're having with a lot of people during the day. And my youngest is in preschool, and he just turned five over winter break. And since he was a year old, he has had a history of asthma that has required hospitalization from time to time. Luckily,  he didn't get very sick of with anything during the pandemic and we really haven't had to worry about it. But as the older ones went back to school and he was unable to be vaccinated, every day felt like a game of chicken between them, my older kids getting back to normal, and the health of my younger one. And masking seems like the least possible thing that we can do for  people in my situation who have unvaccinated people at home. Thankfully now he's vaccinated he had his second dose last week so in two weeks from now, hopefully, will be a step closer. But that's a new development, and it is terrifying to think of what would have happened if that had not.  happened before everything with masking came up. So I'm so grateful that everybody on the board recognizes that this is the least that we can do, adhere to these safety protocols to protect our entire community, not just the little ones that we're entrusted with every day, but their families and their neighbors and their friends.

And I also want to express my appreciation to the school board and staff, teachers, bus drivers, everyone for doing what they can to keep our kids in school safe. The last two years.  The last couple years have been a real struggle, but for many people like me and my family. We were all able to get vaccinated and it felt like things were starting to get back to normal and we all want that so badly, but we've got to acknowledge that we're just not there yet there's still many people in our community.  who are extremely vulnerable to the virus as they have been from the beginning. Nothing has changed for them. And some of them are kids and staff at our schools. They're people we live with and go home to and people we work with. And they do not have a choice in the matter. I believe it's our moral obligation to do everything we can to protect the most vulnerable people in our community.  I think politicizing public health policy like masking that is scientifically proven to work is shameful and forcing our kids and teachers to deal with the controversy within the classroom where the focus should obviously be on learning is sad and it doesn't serve anyone well.

And I wanted to take a moment today to thank you all for keeping strong COVID mitigation policies in place in our schools, including the masking requirement. Because while I do have a child in second grade, I also have a three year old who is currently not eligible to be vaccinated.  The school mass requirement helps us make sure that our daughter can be in school learning while our son's health is protected. And I'm incredibly grateful to you all for not forcing our family to choose between one child's education and another child's health.  But even if that wasn't our situation, we would still support keeping masks in place for now. We teach our kids that their choices and actions have consequences. Wearing a mask isn't just an individual choice. It has consequences for the people, the kids, the teachers around you. Our schools are helping our children learn to be good citizens, to consider the impact of their actions on the people around them.  My daughter understands that she wears a mask not just to keep her little brother safe, but to be compassionate and considerate of the people in our community. That includes her friends, teachers, and school staff who have health conditions themselves, or vulnerable family members at home. And we keep wearing masks to respect the work and sacrifice of the healthcare workers who are struggling through incredibly long hours in the midst of another COVID surge.  We are all eager to be done with COVID and put the pandemic behind us. But the reality is just that we're not there yet. And we've all got to come together for a little while longer to stop the spread of this disease and keep each other safe. So thank you all for doing your part to help us keep our kids and community safe and to get to the other side.<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\njonnoalcaro:",

So what kind of implication do we have from this perspective is really around how can organizations create a more inclusive and equitable workplace culture where everyone feels valued respected included and empowered to bring their whole selves to work every day.  And so one thing it means is moving away from these traditional diversity equity inclusion initiatives which are often focused solely on compliance or checking boxes but instead focusing on creating an environment where people feel like they belong because when people feel seen heard validated and understood at work they perform better they stay longer with companies they become ambassadors for those brands outside of work as well. So some practical things could be implementing mentorship programs training managers to recognize unconscious bias providing resources support services mental health benefits flexible working arrangements all sorts of different",
        "So one thing is we need to be more intentional about how we are building our teams and making sure they have a diverse set of skills because if AI can do some things better than humans then maybe there's other areas where human judgment or creativity would come into play so it could help us think differently around team composition.  Another area for me was just this whole idea of upskilling reskilling as people move through their careers which has been talked about before but now with automation coming at such an incredible pace I really believe that will become even more important especially when looking at certain jobs being displaced by technology what does that mean for those individuals who were doing them? And finally from my perspective also seeing opportunities within organizations like ours to leverage data analytics tools not",
        "So if we think about this concept and how it relates to human resources or talent management within an organization, there are a few things that come up for me.  One is around employee engagement because when people feel like they have more control over their time, which means having some flexibility with respect to where they do their job from, what hours they keep, et cetera, then research has shown us that those employees tend to be happier, healthier, more productive, less likely to leave your company. And so one implication would be looking at flexible scheduling policies as part of our overall benefits package. Another thing that comes out of this idea is really rethinking performance evaluation processes. If someone's working remotely full-time but still meeting all their deadlines, delivering"

What was found out from that study was that we were below market average by around $10 per hour or so. Now, since that time period, we've made adjustments upwards but still remain slightly under where we should be based upon national standards.

In terms of nurse salaries here versus other hospitals within Virginia as well as nationally, we were actually pretty good overall but still below average by $2 per hour across-the-board from registered nurses down to LPNs and CNAs.

And then there was another thing he mentioned earlier which made me wonder whether maybe at least once every year when we do budgeting process, perhaps we should review all of our employee benefits because sometimes over time certain ones become less valuable than others. Maybe we need to adjust them periodically so that we can get more bang out of buck with respect to attracting and retaining talent. That's my only thought. It seems to me that doing an annual review during the budget cycle makes sense. We don't want to change everything around willy-nilly each year either. But certainly reviewing annually does seem reasonable. Anybody else got anything further comments on that point? Ms. Paige",

And then secondly, looking at using your compensation package more strategically to recruit new talent. Both of which I agree wholeheartedly with him on both counts. The first point being it seems clear from all data available that when comparing ourselves against neighboring jurisdictions, whether it's localities or regional governments around Virginia Beach area, we do tend to fall short somewhat significantly in terms of salary ranges across many positions within government. That does create challenges for recruitment and retention because folks can go elsewhere and earn higher paychecks doing similar jobs. On top of that, housing costs locally seem to rise",

That includes all full-time equivalents including part-timers who get no benefits at all. If you take out the non-benefit eligible folks from there, then your average goes up significantly higher than that number because most of them don't receive anything but hourly pay. But anyway, back to where we started with Dr. Earlywine. We had an opportunity last week during budget discussions to talk more specifically about school funding issues which has been brought forward several times tonight.

        "Yeah, so my understanding was when you said they were rebidding those contracts, like what does that mean exactly? Is that something where all bids would come back in lower than before due to market conditions changing? Or how do you see that playing out? Because one thing about construction costs right now with inflation being as high as it is, even though interest rates may go up, which could affect borrowing cost, materials themselves seem really expensive. Like lumber prices went through the roof during COVID-19. Are people anticipating that maybe things won't necessarily drop off by much from their current levels? It seems unlikely given supply chain issues globally. What did you guys hear from contractors who bid last time around? Did anyone say anything along the lines of \"I",
        "Yeah, so you could do an RFP process where they say what their costs would be based off today's market rates as opposed to when those bids were submitted back whenever it was last year. It seems like something worth considering given how much prices seem to change rapidly right now with inflation being high. The only thing about rebidding though is sometimes people who bid before may choose not to participate again depending on circumstances which means potentially fewer bidders overall. You'd want to weigh all factors into consideration including time constraints and potential savings from doing another round of bidding versus sticking with current contracts. That makes sense. Thank you very much. Ms. Page-Haney has her hand up first followed by Mr. Snook. Then after him, Dr.",
        "Yeah, so my understanding was also like you said, Ms Schmitz, which is why when they were talking about rebidding as well, would make sense given where things stand right now with inflationary pressures being what they are. It seems reasonable to me to explore those options before making such significant commitments. Thank you both very much. The last speaker signed up is Mr. Leopold. Then after him, I believe Dr. O'Neil has something she wants to say. After her, I'm done speaking unless someone else signs up. Go ahead, sir."

Can someone walk me through what exactly changed between last year's approved budget and now? What did we find more money from somewhere else? Did something change within the schools themselves where they didn't need as many resources anymore? Or maybe even vice versa? Like, why does the number come up by $1 million dollars? Is anyone aware of anything specific?",

It seems like maybe with inflationary pressures being what they are right now, even if we did decide to move forward, which as you said, who knows where things stand, those prices may change anyway by the end of June. Is that correct? If we went ahead and awarded them today based on current bids, does that mean that once construction starts, costs won't increase due to material price increases? No, absolutely not. Once you award something doesn't lock in all the materials' pricing. There's always risk associated with escalation clauses within contracts. Inflation has been high lately, especially around building supplies. They've seen significant jumps recently. Even after signing agreements, contractors often include language about potential changes related",

In short, just to keep new board members up to date on what we're doing, the VSBA puts together a packet of legislative proposals, which are basically things that they go and lobby the legislature for, the state legislature. The proposals are submitted by various counties and localities, and then they put together a list. It's very brief this year. I welcome you to look over it. If you have anything you want me to say when we vote on these, I'm happy to do so.  Nothing seemed particularly contentious. There was only one proposal that had one dissenting vote. So they're all vetted. They're all vetted before they come to us to look at. There's only one dissenting vote in the whole packet. And that was about having behavioral interventionists as a standard of quality position, which would open up some funding sources for getting basically more mental health counselors and helpers into our schools. If  I'm assuming we won't have any issue with this. So then when I go to the VSPA delegate assembly meeting, which is occurring on Monday, I will just vote yes. And then they will, the VSPA will use its lobbying arm to push these proposals and hopefully get some of them passed. It usually is a long process that takes a little bit of time. It usually kind of you propose something and then you propose the next year and eventually maybe something happens.  So yeah, if we're all in agreement, then that's all I need is the support of the board to vote yes for the VSBA to lobby for these proposals.  I will say real quick, just one thing that, and Dave, you did this last year, right? One thing that kind of shocked me the first go around was just that the positions don't all necessarily align exactly with what we want to do as a school board, because mainly the VSBA is just advocating for local autonomy.

Next up are going to be comments from board members. Does anyone else need any time before we move into public comment period? No takers yet. Okay. Public Comment Period! We're back live now. Our next speaker will be Rachel Deane followed by Sarah Burks. Then after her will come Susan Payne. After which comes John Hossack. Following him will be Emily Greenberg.

And then also one more thing before I make my motions which are going to be related to what we talked about earlier today with regards to COVID protocols at schools. The reason why I'm making them now instead of waiting until next week when we're supposed to discuss those further is because I know some people were concerned about not having enough notice given how quickly Omicron has spread",

So yeah, just going forward as long as everyone's comfortable doing things like that then if someone wants to make a comment or ask questions about something after voting has started, please let us know right away rather than waiting until later when maybe other folks are already done speaking. And also one thing too, Mr. Page mentioned he would be willing to help facilitate those conversations between parents and teachers which could include potentially setting up meetings at schools where all parties can come together discuss concerns around COVID protocols.",

Thank you very much. And then just one other thing before we move forward with our discussion about the budget, which will be coming up soon in terms of how we're going to allocate funds from ARPA money or whether we should use some of those dollars towards teacher raises. But also wanted to mention something related to school safety. There are several people who spoke during public comment tonight asking us to consider implementing metal detectors within schools.

The other thing was with regards to your comment earlier where you said that students were able to get paid through grants which made them eligible for financial aid.

You mentioned you were working with Mr. Kipps and Dr. Brown in terms of looking at some potential changes or adjustments to our budget based upon enrollment numbers being lower than projected? Can you give us an update as far as where those conversations are right now? And if so, do they involve making cuts within certain departments or programs? Or is it more along the lines of shifting resources around because we've got less students coming through the door this fall compared to last spring when projections were made?",

But isn't part of this problem also due to our state laws around finance as well?
