And I am happy to be able to speak to you to express my appreciation to you, the whole school board, the administration, everybody for upholding the current masking guidelines. Like everyone, I would be delighted for things to go back to COVID, pre-COVID normal. But we recognize that we aren't there yet.  I have four children. I have one at Western, one at Henley, and one at Brownsville. That's a lot of contact they're having with a lot of people during the day. And my youngest is in preschool, and he just turned five over winter break. And since he was a year old, he has had a history of asthma that has required hospitalization from time to time. Luckily,  he didn't get very sick of with anything during the pandemic and we really haven't had to worry about it. But as the older ones went back to school and he was unable to be vaccinated, every day felt like a game of chicken between them, my older kids getting back to normal, and the health of my younger one. And masking seems like the least possible thing that we can do for  people in my situation who have unvaccinated people at home. Thankfully now he's vaccinated he had his second dose last week so in two weeks from now, hopefully, will be a step closer. But that's a new development, and it is terrifying to think of what would have happened if that had not.  happened before everything with masking came up.

Because while I do have a child in second grade, I also have a three year old who is currently not eligible to be vaccinated.  The school mass requirement helps us make sure that our daughter can be in school learning while our son's health is protected. And I'm incredibly grateful to you all for not forcing our family to choose between one child's education and another child's health.  But even if that wasn't our situation, we would still support keeping masks in place for now. We teach our kids that their choices and actions have consequences. Wearing a mask isn't just an individual choice. It has consequences for the people, the kids, the teachers around you. Our schools are helping our children learn to be good citizens, to consider the impact of their actions on the people around them.  My daughter understands that she wears a mask not just to keep her little brother safe, but to be compassionate and considerate of the people in our community. That includes her friends, teachers, and school staff who have health conditions themselves, or vulnerable family members at home. And we keep wearing masks to respect the work and sacrifice of the healthcare workers who are struggling through incredibly long hours in the midst of another COVID surge.  We are all eager to be done with COVID and put the pandemic behind us. But the reality is just that we're not there yet. And we've all got to come together for a little while longer to stop the spread of this disease and keep each other safe.

And so we might need to take a closer look at our overall nurse pay scales and make sure that we can stay competitive for top talent. The other thing that I think will help us there is if we can find ways to improve morale. Because once again, while salaries and wages are important, they are not the only factor. If people feel supported, if they feel heard, if they feel respected, they're more likely to stick around. And one thing that came up several times was that our nurses felt like they were underappreciated. They didn't feel seen or recognized for",

Number two, they do offer a more competitive salary range for most positions because they can afford to. They have a lot deeper pockets than we do.

All of the benefits that we have in that section  quite nice, and like we were talking about before, that benefit package might really help us to sort of keep some of our employees, even though some of our nurses, for instance, may not be able to make as much money outside of, you know, if they stay in the county.

It could be to just say, this is what you have.

That certainly came up at lunchtime conversation earlier. And I think there are other factors involved in retaining folks beyond just financial incentives.

The third option, I think, could get a little bit more complicated depending on who you wanted to extend the school year for, but we also know that as we move through the year, we may have some better revenue pictures or so that, you know, we could make those decisions a little later on as we go forward.

We continued to project an increase in FY21 to reflect the previous year's increase, but that was a year of our largest decline due to the pandemic.  As we build towards FY23, we are projecting an increase in actual enrollment as represented by the orange dotted line, but a decrease in budget to budget enrollment as represented by the blue dotted line. We believe that this projection represents growth due to growing development in the county and students returning back to our schools. However, the reality is that homeschooling is increasing and had been before the pandemic  and we're using this current year's enrollment as a new baseline. Here, packed onto one slide, are the changes in budget due to enrollment and demographics, with the exception of special education, which will be presented later. The reason why this is shown all together is because these items are related and cannot always be distinguished from each other. First, the budget-to-budget enrollment change.  The decreasing enrollment results in 29.4 fewer FTEs for the division based on our current staffing standards. Other smaller changes include a slight reduction due to the Crozet redistricting study that was approved, a modest increase in world languages staffing, and small increases in Center One and ESOL staffing. These increases are offset by the elimination of contingency FTEs that were budgeted in the FY22 budget.  After these enrollment and demographic changes, we are proposing to maintain the level of staffing that we have in our schools this year by reducing our staffing ratios by one student. In doing so, we would be adding back the approximately 30 FTEs that are reduced in the top portion of this table. This net change results in an approximately zero FTE change from budget to budget in this category.  Dr. Haas presented this class size reduction proposal and the draft funding requests.

Last month, we had the wonderful opportunity to hear from Baker Butler educators about the nationally recognized gains they have made in closing the achievement gap at their school.  Tonight we're focusing on yet another opportunity gap in our schools and in schools across our nation, the percentage of students of color who enter STEM related fields. 45 years ago, an organization was established to address this issue, the National Society of Black Engineers. Its mission was ambitious and vital to the collective prosperity of every community in the United States.  The society was organized to promote academic excellence, provide scholarships, train leaders, and expand access to professional careers. A few years ago, the society broadened its charter to include high school chapters, and one of the first chapters in Central Virginia was established at Albemarle High School. Membership is open to students from all of our middle school and high schools, regardless of race or ethnicity. Students from Greer, Burley, and soon Walton are members and students  are members, and students from UVA serve as mentors. There currently are 25 students in our local chapter, and more than 100 students have had their lives changed by this extraordinary program. Many have gone on to earn engineering degrees at the university level. The driving, guiding, determined light for these young people continues to be Ms. Pearl Early, Albemarle High School student support specialist.  A characteristic of this program is its strong emphasis on project-based learning. Students learn how to research, design, experiment with, and refine solutions that can improve our lives. A natural topic this year is COVID-19, and true to form, students have come up with an ingenious approach to protecting public health. I understand that the nature of this development process is that it can take up to two years, but our students have field-tested their invention within seven months.  I'd like to ask Ms. Early to tell us a little more about the journey of her students over these past seven years, and to introduce us to today's superstars who will tell us about their new discovery. Ms. Early?",

As you may recall, back in October, we heard a presentation from our chief academic officer about the district's comprehensive literacy plan. Tonight, we're going to take a deeper dive into some of the specific strategies being implemented across our schools to improve student outcomes in reading.  We've invited several educators and administrators to share their experiences and successes with us tonight. Our first presenter is Dr. Jane Smith, who serves as an instructional coach at Lincoln Elementary School. Dr. Smith has been working closely with teachers to implement new approaches to phonics instruction, and she'll be sharing some exciting results with us today. Dr. Smith? drs",

As we all know, reading proficiency has been a challenge for many of our students, and it's an area where we need to focus some attention.  So, tonight, Dr. Laura Henderson, who is our director of elementary education, will talk about the professional development opportunities we're providing for our teachers to help them better support their students in improving their reading skills. And then following Dr. Henderson, we'll also hear from three teachers who've participated in this training, and they'll share with us what they learned and how they're implementing these strategies in their classrooms. Let me introduce Dr. Henderson now. Dr. Henderson? laurah",
        "Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Spotlight on Education is one of my favorite parts of the agenda because it gives us an opportunity to recognize some of the outstanding achievements of our students and staff in the district. Tonight's spotlight is particularly special because it highlights a program that has had a profound impact on our students' lives.  Our district is committed to providing opportunities for all students to succeed, regardless of their background or circumstances. One way we do this is through our Migrant Education Program. This program provides additional support services to migrant students who are facing unique challenges as they move from school to school due to their parents' seasonal work. Tonight, we're recognizing the incredible work being done by our Migrant Education team, led by Ms. Maria Rodriguez"

I know that we're not dealing with unlimited resources and we have to make a lot of really difficult decisions to educate 14,000 students. So I really appreciate all the work that staff has done and definitely the people on the ground who are doing every day. So I really appreciate that.  I just have a concern about the equity between the virtual learning and the hybrid learning. Also because we know nationally and locally that more of our black and brown families are choosing that. So I just want to make sure that we have some assurances. It will be important to me that we have some assurances that is robust for my decision making.  Firstly, I have a question about intervention services. And I think a way for me to be able to get my head around this is to know how many students will lose intervention services in stage four as it is now. And I know that you don't have those numbers ready, but that's something that I would like to know next week. Also, I would like to know how instructional hours for the hybrid learners will compare with the instructional hours  of the virtual learners in K-3, or pre-K-3, I guess, for the four-day-a-week students. I assume that the 4-5, 4-12, I guess, would be the same. But I just would like to know the difference, if there is any difference between the instructional time for those youngest learners.  And then I also would like to know how if or how meal services will be affected. For the students who are at home. And then on a different note, I don't know if this is something that  Ross considers or we consider how this works. But I wonder if we should be looking at updated mask guidance, given that the new variant is likely coming or here.

So English language learners could come in every day based on  the kinds of scheduling we're looking at. They have been identified as high-risk learners. And all the task force documents from DOE, our task force, they're identified as a priority. So we would try to get them into school buildings as much as possible for as many days during the week as we could. So those become priorities for us.

We don't have another section for it, usually 9.0, but Ms. Colson, if that's what you were gonna do, please, now would be the time.\nkatrinacallsen: Yeah, so my other business piece, and I had the chance to talk to a few of you guys on the phone, is just that speaking about taking the time to digest things and look at our data and evaluate, when we made the decision about Confederate imagery a year ago or at the start of the school year, the goal was to go back and see if we needed to take any further action. And I would like to respectfully request that we do so.  I think there's a lot that could be said about it and probably more eloquently by some of our other board members. But just from my role as an assistant city attorney, I can say that I don't think we're escaping any kind of liability by not taking action when we already effectively are banning it through our superintendent. And we're opening ourself up to a lot of optics problems and beyond optics.  We're sending a message to our students. It's really easy to resolve since we already are not allowing students to wear Confederate imagery. And I think it's time that we make a resolution and move on. So I don't think we can make a motion at this meeting for something like that, although I am confused because we did make a motion for the holiday at the beginning. So I'm open to other input about how we should proceed, but I think it's past time.\njonnoalcaro: You know, I think what we should do is let's get a consensus as to if the board wants to move forward with this.

And I guess we all know this, but in middle school, the grade levels stay together in a group. So when the sixth graders eat lunch, the seventh graders and eighth graders are not.

Judyle expressed concerns about implementing cohort groups and asked about additional ventilation and HEPA filtration in bathrooms, which Rosalyn Schmitt said was not currently planned.

The first thing you need to do when considering a construction project like this, where we've already done design work, is you want to weigh the pros and cons of rebidding. One con would be potential cost savings from current market conditions. If we go back out to bid now, we may end up with a lower price tag than what we were previously awarded. On the other hand, though, you also risk getting less favorable bids due to changes in materials prices or other market factors. You also risk losing time by rebidding, which could potentially impact our ability to secure funding for these projects.

And so there will always be one staff member leader for every 18 members. Very, often it's it's even a lower ratio than that.  In our summer programs, we have about two staff members for about every 22 kids. And so we will always have a eyes on eyes, supervising adults that have been background checked and certified safe leaders of our clubs inside the building, outside the building, field trips, any club activity.\njonnoalcaro: And I guess I know you said it, but I guess I missed it. What's your total number of staff estimated to be for the for this property?\njanriespierce: We'll have probably 25 member staff on hand at any one time during the after school program.

If you're working with children who may be coming from schools that do have disciplinary issues, especially if they're being referred by social workers, how are you handling that in terms of managing behavior and ensuring safety for everyone else when you can't just log off or put someone in timeout as an example."

In short, just to keep new board members up to date on what we're doing, the VSBA puts together a packet of legislative proposals, which are basically things that they go and lobby the legislature for, the state legislature. The proposals are submitted by various counties and localities, and then they put together a list. It's very brief this year. I welcome you to look over it. If you have anything you want me to say when we vote on these, I'm happy to do so.  Nothing seemed particularly contentious. There was only one proposal that had one dissenting vote. So they're all vetted. They're all vetted before they come to us to look at. There's only one dissenting vote in the whole packet. And that was about having behavioral interventionists as a standard of quality position, which would open up some funding sources for getting basically more mental health counselors and helpers into our schools. If  I'm assuming we won't have any issue with this. So then when I go to the VSPA delegate assembly meeting, which is occurring on Monday, I will just vote yes. And then they will, the VSPA will use its lobbying arm to push these proposals and hopefully get some of them passed. It usually is a long process that takes a little bit of time. It usually kind of you propose something and then you propose the next year and eventually maybe something happens.  So yeah, if we're all in agreement, then that's all I need is the support of the board to vote yes for the VSBA to lobby for these proposals.  I will say real quick, just one thing that, and Dave, you did this last year, right? One thing that kind of shocked me the first go around was just that the positions don't all necessarily align exactly with what we want to do as a school board, because mainly the VSBA is just advocating for local autonomy.

That's that's I'll be honest, that's kind of a moving target. One of the things that we know is there are multiple ways that people are getting the vaccine. One is through our local clinics and we're we're hoping to be able to one of our Albemarle County clinics. We've done our first one. We're hoping to be able to do a second one.  We've been working with the Blue Ridge Health District, and that is all dependent on the available vaccine. They also are vaccinating people at the Kmart tent through the Blue Ridge Health District, and they're working on some other partnerships. And so, unfortunately, we don't have hard numbers on that. I don't know if Ryan can give us a little bit better sense of what's going on with that.\nryanmckay: So just to provide a little context, we were notified, I believe, two weeks ago that our weekly allotment for vaccine is 2850. That's for the entire health district. So if a primary care provider, a pharmacy or even one of our hospitals wants to order a vaccine, it has to come from that 2850 allotment, which has to cover our entire district.  So right now there is scarce availability for the vaccine and we need to spread that vaccine in a way that's most equitable to our entire community and so it makes it difficult to sort of carve out large chunks of numbers for individuals who receive the vaccine.  Based on our current schedule, those that have an appointment to get vaccinated are all in February at this point. We are trying to expand to the extent possible, and when we do, we'll make options available for K-12 educators, including those in Elmoral County, to access either by providing enough vaccine where they can operate that site again at Charlottesville High School in tandem with Charlottesville City Schools,  and the Regional Emergency Operations Center at our Kmart location or in hopefully the near future at the Big Lots location that is operated by UVA Health.

In terms of distribution of vaccines, CVS Pharmacy and Walgreens, because they had contracts directly with CMS, were allocated separately outside of our 2850 dose allocation. So, they received their own separate allocation directly from CDC for administration at long-term care facilities.

You know, and to that point, Graham, I think one of the things that would be important for  all of our folks and including the nurses to be asked is what's important to you? What keeps you here? Because it may not, in some cases, be money. It may be other things. And it's not just money that motivates everybody.\ndanreddng: All right, that really is bringing us to our second part of the report that our breakout group will look at tonight. And that is the section on compensation and benefits recognition and engagement. So some of those other things that do attract and retain employees.  That section of the report is pages 31 through 35, so it follows the section we just looked at the page has exit surveys on the left side that's part of the classified staff section and compensation on the right.  So let's take about five minutes. And again, you're looking for a section within that part of the report that you'll want to respond to, as we did with the previous section. So go ahead and give those couple of pages, 31 through 35, a quick read right now.\nunknownspeaker: Thank you.\ndanreddng: We've got about two minutes for this part.  and try to wrap up your reading and identify what passage you might want to reflect and respond on. So we've got about 20 seconds.  And Mr. Page, if we can start with you this time.

        "Yes, thank you. In terms of the job satisfaction survey data, what stands out to me was that 72% of teachers responded saying that they were satisfied with their jobs overall. Now that's good, but it could also say to me that maybe there are opportunities where we need to focus on improving job satisfaction with that 28%. But I'm wondering how many years have been involved in studying teacher satisfaction. Have we had any trends over those years of being consistently high satisfaction rates or have we seen some declines over recent years? And then finally, another question I'd have related to whether we have any breakdowns by schools of teacher satisfaction rates or is this an aggregate number across the entire school system?",
        "Okay. My question was related to something we were discussing earlier when Dr. Acuff made a comment about whether teachers are satisfied with their salaries based upon where they live, as opposed to being compared across the state. In table six, which is on page 33, could someone explain how these numbers were derived and why, say, Albemarle County would be number three while Charlottesville city schools would be number nine? Is there an explanation given somewhere else in the packet? Or should it simply be presented by HR?",
        "Well, I guess the only thing that stood out was from some of these exit interviews. Some of them are pretty brutal, actually. But they seem to have the same kind of theme, which seems to be that people are underpaid and overworked and don't feel appreciated. And then another item I saw, like Ms. Lee pointed out earlier, when people leave, sometimes there's no real reason given or no explanation why they're leaving, which makes it difficult to understand why they left. Those were my observations. Anybody else?"

As I reviewed the section on compensation and benefits recognition and engagement (pages 31-35), what struck me was the emphasis on work-life balance being a crucial factor in job satisfaction. Specifically, on page 33, where it mentions that \"employees who feel their employer cares about their well-being are more likely to stay.\" This resonated with me because, as educators, we often prioritize student needs over our own personal well-being.\n\nIn light of this finding, I'd like to propose exploring ways to promote better work-life balance among our staff, perhaps by",

So at the beginning of the pandemic, there was a federal mandate for employers to offer leave for employees. It was an expanded family medical leave, and it covered employees if they needed to be home because they were ill or a family member was ill.  When that legislation expired, there was an option for employers to continue doing that. We've taken advantage of that and continue to offer those leave statuses or forms of those leave statuses to our employees out of the interest of their health and well-being.<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\ngrahampaige:",

All right, well, we also met what 1094 and 1095 tax reporting requirements that were required for the Affordable Care Act. So that too is a good benefit. All of the benefits that we have in that section  quite nice, and like we were talking about before, that benefit package might really help us to sort of keep some of our employees, even though some of our nurses, for instance, may not be able to make as much money outside of, you know, if they stay in the county. Some of these benefits, I think, could be able to sort of keep some people here, draw some in. I think that would be pretty important. So that might be some of the implications of this report for our work is to consider our benefits package and continue to look into how we use that to attract and retain our employees. Yes, right.
