The school board wishes, excuse me, the school board invites and actively seeks the public's input in the matters relevant to school board governance and provides for time during its business meetings to hear from Albemarle County residents and community members. The school board wishes to maintain appropriate meeting decorum so that persons can observe and hear the proceedings of the school board and that attendees online are not subject to inappropriate language and conduct. As my son I'm sorry is crying in the background, you know, he waited until it was my moment to speak and and this is when he's doing it so if you hear him. It is all right, my husband's dealing with it. As authorized by ordinance of the county of Albemarle the school board will hold its meetings. electronically during the COVID-19 pandemic. The school board is nevertheless committed to encouraging public comment despite its need to meet on a virtual basis. For this reason, there will be two ways for the public to provide comment. First, as always, written comments may be submitted to the school board clerk prior to the start of the meeting, and they will be given to all the school board members for review. And as long as the school board holds its meetings electronically, members of the public wishing to provide public comment during the school board meeting may sign up online by 2 p.m. the day of the meeting. Before electronic public comment starts, I'm going to announce the order in which your speakers will comment. I'm actually going to, there's 11 speakers, so I'll just announce the first three. Each speaker's access to public comment will be activated when it's that speaker's turn to provide comment to the members of the school board. Speakers are going to be notified when they reach the two minute mark and at the three minute mark. It is me doing the notification and it's generally just me waving when you're at the one minute mark and then waving when it's time to stop. Speakers during the meeting are those submitting written comments should state their name, address, or magisterial district. Further, speakers should limit comments to those matters that are relevant to school board governance or the operations of the school division. And lastly, although the school board will not respond to comments made during the public comment period, school board members may address comments at the end of the meeting agenda under other business. And with that, the first speaker, one second. is going to be Jen T.W., the second speaker is going to be Jeff Handler, and the third speaker is going to be Tara Ilgner.

I wanna start by thanking all staff and families for the time, patience, hard work and flexibility. Our two sons are in elementary school, pre-K and second grade for the virtual start. I appreciate the thoughtfulness, attention to detail and concern that their teachers and schools have shown. Our family also appreciates the cafeteria and bus staffs for daily meals via buses daily. The learning materials available that we pick up also help supplement and add to their seesaw learning and Zoom class meetings. Our family is finding what works for us and we're excited to keep learning and engaging with teachers and classmates. I'm also an educator for Albemarle County Public Schools. This is my 14th year with Albemarle County. I'm a collaborative high school special education teacher. I just wanted to share that my two different co-teachers and I have been forming great relationships already with students and families. Our Zoom classes are also successful and engaging. The attention to detail and creativity is evident. I've even had a new student, a ninth grader, call me on the phone to share a piece of work that she was proud of for another class. This is one week after meeting me. It just made me happy that she felt safe and interested to call me. But now I just want to share my concerns and fears for moving into phase three prematurely. And this kind of reminds me of my son's assignment about the power of yet. It's concerning to hear news of educators of varying ages who are not only becoming exposed or sick, but dying. College campuses, even in our own community, are places with increasing positive COVID cases and exposures. I feel that acting hastily and reopening before it's safe to do so, and there's a vaccine available, will push things back negatively. We should wait to vote on moving up in phases when it is safe to do so and cases are not steadily rising in our community and state. Teachers and staff has spent time doing extra PD to prepare to be more successful virtually and to get families and get more familiar with a variety of technology and online resources. Students and families are being asked for feedback so that changes and modifications can be made to make future lessons better and more engaging. We're putting extra time and energy to make this virtual start work. I wanna close with the reminder that we're all in this together. Thank you.\"},\n",

Um, so I'm a citizen of Charlottesville resident Charlottesville, and, but I just had a question about the HMSA and the Mesa special education programs through Albemarle school. I understand that city children are not eligible for consideration for these Albemarle school academies. And I just wanted to understand why. I didn't realize this wouldn't be a question answer sort of situation so I'll just throw all my questions out there and you guys get to them as you can. But my questions are this. So I understand there may have been segregationist policies in the past that kept downtown Charlottesville away from the Albemarle schools, but is that still the policy? And if that's not the real reason why Charlottesville city kids can't petition or apply to attend Albemarle schools, is it because their families are not contributing taxes, in which case, why is tuition not an option? If the issue is that there are too many kids in Albemarle, wouldn't the application process allow the academies to regulate their size? So I'm just not sure I understand whether it's a size of the class issue or a funding or tax issue or segregationist issue. I just don't know what the reason is for keeping that. completely inaccessible to city kids. So my kids are residents of Charlottesville, as I said. I work at UVA in the Earth Sciences Department. I'm in graduate school for atmospheric chemistry. My kids are bright, but there are also lots of other kids here in the city who would, underprivileged children who would really benefit from this option. So basically what I'm asking is, is this separation necessary or just by preference? That's all.\"},\n",

We all know that we have confirmed cases. here the first weeks of phase two, right here in Elmira County. We all know the cases in Virginia are on the rise due to one big factor being UVA. Why would anyone even consider putting children's lives, their families, educational staff lives on the line when we know it's dangerous to do so? By the way, I teach at Albemarle High School in special education and government. I want to read what a senior wrote to me today, and he gave me permission for me to share it with you tonight because it was too late for him to get on. This is from Josh Francisco to everyone. about opening up schools before any form of effective medical advancement for the purpose of combating COVID would lead to nothing but disaster and is a move that is begging to get everyone infected. The concept of herd immunity is also worrying because not only is COVID an extremely painful experience, as testified by my friend in Italy, that actually currently has it. But also, you're not guaranteed to survive. My father, who is a nurse, has told me a true story here in UVA that a woman had COVID once before and is now recovering for the second time. And he specifically says, I'm not too fond of the idea of dying, coming close to dying, or being afflicted by something that is extremely painful. I don't think anybody else wants that either. I'm, I asked you as a member as to really carefully look at what the Elmira Educational Association has laid out. These are my words, not his now. Measurable, reliable benchmarks that can guide the school board in deciding when to move between phases. It's not OK for all this responsibility to be sitting in your lap. And I saw it on different times. You're saying, oh, should I open? Should I not open? Well, my goodness. You laid out exactly what each phase looks like. But it can't be just like nine weeks. And then it's going to magically disappear. An arbitrary nine weeks in one phase, then go to the next is not acceptable. You need to use science and data and look at the experts. I can only see that that's the way we could move forward, and it would help you to say you know if you don't like what lmr was laid out, and they're very specific. The Education Association on, and it seems like you have. Um, but make your own and make it clean and make it with CDC guidelines and, you know, and they've done that. So I just ask that you would really highly look at that. And by the way, I am teaching it at Elmorrow high school and, and it's, it is really working. I don't know how it works in the elementary, but I know we have more kids attending than before.\"},\n",

I gotta give my hats off to everybody in Amarillo County, public schools, all the staff, and everybody, the teachers that are making this work. We've got two kids, we've got a child at Baker Butler, another one at Jack Jewett, and it's been fantastic. As far as with as much, the minimal amount of resources y'all have gotten, and to be able to make it work as well as you could. Our first grader, you know, he's having a tougher time. He just loves being in school with friends and stuff. But, you know, we balance that with being in the emergency department and things are still tough. Supply lines, they haven't really bolstered them at a federal level. So we're not any better off. I don't know a single hospital of any of my colleagues that work at, they're back to single use PPE, you know, appropriate mask supplies and things like that. In the Charlottesville area, it's been, Last week, I think the university emergency department effectively shut down for half a day they went on divert because they were so busy they couldn't take any more patients which obviously. there's only two hospitals in our area, so people have to go somewhere but, and that is with we had a surge in July and August, and it was it was not a fun time and so we're off of that, but obviously with the weather changing. You know, we don't know what's going to happen. There's a flu outbreak I was reading in San Francisco today we were hoping we might escape that the southern hemisphere largely did but That's a gamble we have to take. Whatever you decide, we just need to take all that into consideration and that the fact that the virus seems to be spread primarily through the air by airborne vectors. I don't know that I've seen a confirmed, I don't know that I've personally seen a confirmed case of like an outdoor transmission. I'm not saying that's not possible, clearly, but people are outdoors and away from each other, you get a lot of ventilation, it's a lot safer and it's a lot harder to do as we go forward. I'm not just to make sure that whatever you decide to do that you're keeping all of that in consideration, because if we have to hit the brakes again and we should probably have a plan to do that. By the time we do hit the brakes, you know it takes two or three weeks. to slow down if that makes sense and catch up. And, you know, it's the emergency services folks that are gonna be sort of the brakes for that. So, you know, we're coming at it from two ways, both as a family that works in emergency services and with kids that we'd like to get back in school. So it's tough. And if you guys just make sure you take that into consideration as you go forward. Thank you.\"},\n",

I graduated from college and came to work for Albemarle County and this is my thirty first year. That being said, I am all in Albemarle County. That being said, I am in that age group where COVID is something that worries me. I am in that medical group where my doctors filled out all my ADA forms and I cannot return to a building. This virtual start has been amazing. I don't know many teachers that won't tell you that this has gone better than we ever thought it could. And that doesn't mean that we haven't had technology problems and Wi-Fi problems and problems. But the bond that I have already built with my children, I can't imagine in November losing the ones that go back into the building. I can't imagine that. And I don't think it will be good for them either because We've bonded under these pandemic circumstances and we're important to each other and we're learning and we're learning together and we're having fun. I know these parents at three weeks better than I have ever in years because they're sitting beside their kids, because they're walking behind their kids, because they're checking on their kids, because they're popping into Zooms to say, hey, Ms. Stallings, I need help with We text, we email, communication couldn't be better. It just couldn't be better. I'm speaking for myself and I know that everybody has a different point of view with that, but the majority of teachers I've heard from, it's been a very positive opening. So I'm asking you to really think about all of those kinds of things about how it's gonna affect the kids I'm asking you to really think before we move into stage three. And you're welcome anytime to pop into my Zoom class. I think you'd love what these little kids have to say about things. And I appreciate your continued hard work.

       "  'text': \"Hi, thank you so very much for having me. My name is Bo Odom. I'm a parent of a first grader at Greer Elementary. So we're in the Jack Jewett neighborhood. And really sincerely, I wanna thank our first grade teacher. incredible. We think she's fantastic. She's been working incredibly hard. When issues arise on Zoom, she's seeking to pivot to the next best option. She's sweet. She's kind. She's, she noticeably tries to care for each child present on Zoom. I assume she's a lot like Ms. Stallings and, and I would hope you'd all look, look up Archer's first grade teacher and give her a raise and give all these teachers a raise. But I, but I do want to say that, well, we have a first grader and I can only speak to that experience. But I think it's really imperative that you know what that experience is. And I believe Ms. Stongs when she says that it has been a good enriching experience for the children and they have a bonded relationship. But I would argue that this experience is not working for my first grader. I don't believe students are learning. Our daughter is not learning. I believe it's enrichment. I'd urge you to visit any first grade Zoom class. It's a bit of pandemonium. Distractions abound, and we knew that was gonna be an issue, but distractions compound with little attention first graders can dedicate to YouTube videos and whiteboards that are unfocused, and nine different other students continuously unmuting and forgetting to re-mute, and continuous background noises they add to the cacophony. And even if one student is overeager, they end up dominating the questions that are asked to the general class. answering the question before my daughter has an opportunity. And I want to be real. I mean, these are first graders. These are first graders. We shouldn't expect the kind of self-control that is necessary for an online format. I just want to say that I don't believe my daughter is receiving the attention that's necessary for learning at this age. I echo again how marvelous I think my daughter's teacher is. But the experiences in education, I would say it's enrichment. Yes, she's learning social cues. She knows What a mute button is, and she's getting ever so personal look at the range of privilege in this world. And I'm really, really grateful for those things. I know that we have an incredible amount of privilege in our household. We have good internet. We have a quiet place to retreat. We have two parents with flexible schedules who can be one of those parents in the background. But I can't even imagine what this experience would be for those without the privilege that we have. But in reading and math and particularly in writing, my daughter needs so much help. She's already tested and placed in remedial help in kindergarten. This is not a format of education for first grade. And it seems that the education that's necessary is simply impossible over Zoom. They are learning to enjoy and appreciate, but they're not practicing any skill building, the skill building that's necessary. Thank you so very much for taking my comments.\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"So hi, my name is Catherine Deatley and I teach kindergarten at Meriwether Lewis. And like many of the teachers in the county, I want nothing more than to go back to the classroom and be with my students. But I only want that when it is safe for everyone. When I read an AEA email stating the county was planning on proposing we go to phase three in November, my anxiety levels immediately went through the roof. The three main reasons for this anxiety are health, choice, and student impact. As an asthmatic, the idea of going back in a person during a global pandemic that involves a respiratory illness scares me. And as much as I want to see my students and my colleagues, the fear of possibly coming into contact with someone who unknowingly has COVID is real for any teacher, staff member, and student that is considered high risk. This leads me to my second reason for the anxiety, the choice I may have to make. If the rumor mill is true, then teachers will be given a choice to either go face-to-face or stay virtual. If we go face-to-face, we get to keep our class. If we remain virtual, then we lose our class. We lose our students that we have spent weeks getting to know and have built relationships, bonds, and trust with. I love and adore my students. And while virtual learning is not the ideal situation, we are making it work the best that we can. My students continue to amaze me every day with their resilience, persistence, kindness, and patience. And yes, there have been a few bumps here and there, but we are able to push on because we know that we are in this together. We continue to learn through singing, movement, discussion, art, games, play, and exploration. My kids are even writing at this point. All approaches that we are using are developmentally appropriate. And lastly, I have extreme anxiety over the learning experience my students will have if we go back face to face too soon. Research will tell you that our youngest learners learn best through play, movement, music, interaction, and hands-on exploration. If we go back face-to-face where we have to follow strict safety measures, the majority of what we know to be developmentally appropriate will be unusable. Instead, it will be replaced with our students trying to sit in a desk for the majority of their school day, six feet from the friends that they just wanna play with, looking at the toys that they can't play with. There will be no group exploration of dirt or games of chase on the playground. If we aren't able to teach our students in the best way we know how, just so they can stay safe, then what kind of education are we truly providing them with? And to ACPS, what is more important, keeping everyone safe while providing a developmentally appropriate education or simply putting warm bodies in a building where they will receive a mediocre education and run the risk of getting sick? Please fight for us and do what is right for everybody. Thank you for your time. And Katrina, thank you for saying my last name correctly.\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"All right, well, in that case, I am going to go ahead and start my time. My name is Maggie Johnson. I am the German one and two teacher at Monticello High School here in Albemarle County. I live in Charlottesville City, but I teach in the county and I'm proud to. I'd like to first make it clear that my comments represent exclusively my own perspective and my own concerns. I do not claim to speak for any other teachers or any other staff or faculty in the county. I think it goes without saying that this virtual school year is not our ideal. I miss seeing my students. I am only in my second year of teaching, but I already have grown to love being in a physical classroom and being around students, and I miss them. And I miss the spontaneity of in-person teaching, and I miss being able to create a physical space to let my students learn and grow as people and within the boundaries of the language that I teach. But even considering the shortcomings of virtual education, the fact of the matter is that it is not safe for in-person instruction, even on a hybrid level, and it will not be safe to return to in-person instruction until there is an effective and accessible vaccine available. Put plainly, if we return to in-person schooling, even on a hybrid schedule, people will become sick with COVID-19, and people will die of COVID-19 as a direct result of that decision. Instead of worrying about when and how to return to in-person instruction, I think that the school board and the county as a whole need to focus on how to facilitate the best possible online instruction. The questions of when and how to return to in-person classes should not even be considered until the CDC approves distribution of a vaccine, and that vaccine is made accessible to every person. Instead, I would like for the school board to focus their efforts solely on supporting teachers, staff, students, and families in the district with online education. I genuinely believe that if we accept that this is our reality for the foreseeable future, instead of deluding ourselves with thinking we can return to in-person or hybrid for the 2020-21 year, we can learn powerful lessons as a county and as individuals to take into our instruction when it is safe. To emphasize that point to the minute I have left, I'd like to offer some improvements that I've already begun to see in my planning and teaching, even in these first three weeks of classes. Being limited to 45 minutes of direct synchronous instruction at the high school level means that I am making more deliberate intentional decisions about what, when, and how to teach material. This is allowing me to explore a flipped approach to my classes in which students take notes on grammatical structures or learn vocabulary asynchronously. And we then practice during synchronous classes. I am also able to focus more closely on students achieving proficiency and understanding with the material instead of feeling pressured to assign record graded exercises or assignments. The online format further means that I can explore new programs and technologies to incorporate into class, such as Flipgrid or Edpuzzle, which I've already started to use Flipgrid in my classes to make learning more engaging and more accessible to every student. When the day comes that it's safe to return to in-person, I'll be able to use these technologies as part of my standard curriculum because I'll have had plenty of experience using them in a variety of ways. That's all of the time that I have, but I have submitted comments via email to the school board that I would like for you to please review when you're considering the next steps for the county. Thank you.\"},\n",

And I just wanted to ask a few questions and hopefully raise a few points about moving to a potentially hybrid situation. And Right now, teachers are working really hard as they have been and as they tend to always do. And we've spent about a month with students and about two months planning. And we are still, you know, trying to make sure that we are doing everything we can and covering all of our bases without overtaxing the students. I'm worried that moving to a hybrid plan this soon while students are still figuring out how to handle Um, the, the virtual plan would only confuse things even more. And I just wanted to make sure we have a few things like hammered out before we actually move into a hybrid plan. And some things that I wanted to be aware of, um, will we prepare the schools, um, it to be disinfected and clean, or is that something a teacher is going to have to do? Um, is there going to be increased air ventilation in the classrooms, which already have, um, poor ventilation as it is. Are there going to be more resources and structures for the teachers to handle doing an online class as well as an in-person class? Because there's a lot of, a lot of our resources right now are already being stretched to the capacity, doing what we're doing as it is. So trying to do both seems like asking a lot. Are there going to be ways to ensure that students are actually abiding by the health protocols and not putting other people at risk? Will there be compensation for teachers who have children who are also in the hybrid plan and they can't leave their children at home? And will there be compensation for teachers who have to come in to a hybrid plan and put themselves at risk if their colleagues can't come in? And I don't mean to sound accusatory. I don't mean to sound antagonistic. I just want to make sure that we've considered a lot of these things that need to happen before we can safely move into a hybrid plan. Thank you for your time.

At the last school board meeting, I raised my concerns that the five stages of return to school had no health criteria associated with them. Without these criteria, there's no context. At the beginning of each meeting you all have, the school board meeting, you all discuss to some great degree the various statistics and data regarding COVID-19 in the health district. Without the context of criteria for each of the return to school stages, this is all meaningless. It's mere theater. Clearly, the school board has decided it's safer for some students to return to school and also for the children of teachers and staff to return for childcare at the schools. So of course, there must have been some health standards for them to return to the school that the school board hasn't released. I'm requesting again that you somehow come up with criteria for each stage of return to school and publish it so that we can know how close or far away we are from being able to return to in-school learning, which I think we all agree is best for the students.

And I hope, swear I wasn't trying to jerry-rig my way into the closing spot. That is just unfortunate. So I'll just sort of reiterate what I was saying. I'm a teacher. at Mountain View Elementary School. I'm in the Scottsville District along with my two kids. And I know you've heard a little bit, but I do want to reiterate that things are going really well. I have a first grader, and I just did want to respond to Bo's comment about skill building. If we were in person, responsive classroom says the first six weeks of school are all about building routine. So I don't think the education his child is receiving is any different than what he would be getting in the building. It takes six weeks to get to know your class, to build routines, And that's what's happening now. It just looks different and it's on Zoom. And my first grader is having a wonderful time. I really think that it's important that before you vote, that I really think every school board member should attend meetings with the staffs at the schools that you represent. I appreciate Ellen and Graham are already going to be coming to Mountain View along with Dr. Haas. and anyone else that wants to, I think hearing from the teachers is crucial. And unless you really make that transparent, I think that you're missing out on a huge piece of information that teachers can provide. We can let you know how things are going. We can let you know what in-person looks like at current status. We can talk about how we've problem solved and we can talk about how well things are going. And we can also, you will find out soon how many teachers will not be returning in person until it's safe. I think you need to know that before voting. I also think that it's really important that transparency in the medical and in the teacher capacity is really evident before voting. Um, I also want to say that as in the same way that our school system when we have a snow day, sort of, even though some schools might have totally fine roads nearby and you're thinking man why do we have a snow day these roads are fine but we've got those dirt roads way out in the county and it's not safe for them. By the same token, I see one more minute. By the same token, at some schools that are much smaller, maybe they feel much more equipped to take on phase three. At my school, that would be 470 students would be eligible to come in for phase three. And that's just not sustainable. Right now we have 15. So to go from 15 to 470, Potential students is just, that's really a hard pill to swallow, and I don't know how we would do that. So I really think that getting to know your schools and really figuring out what each phase looks like is really important. So that's all. I really feel strongly that you know that phase two is going well, and the biggest complaint I hear is the schedule, and I have some solutions to that if you'd like to hear them, but that's all I have to say. Thanks.\"},\n",

Earlier today, the U.S. Department of Education announced their National Blue Ribbon Awards for Excellence in Academic Performance. For the first time in the program's 38-year history, a Virginia school has received the department's Exemplary Award for Closing Achievement Gaps. I'm proud to say that our own Baker Butler is one of four schools in our state to meet the very high standards for this recognition. In fact, of the 1,800 schools in Virginia, only 58 even qualified in this category. The award covers three school years beginning with 2016-17. Over this time period, SOL pass rates for English language learners, special education students, and students from economically disadvantaged homes increased by 87% for math and 78% in reading. Yes, those are increases, not the pass rate. This far exceeded the increase in overall pass rates of 15% in math and 11% in reading in Virginia. As a result, the achievement gap in reading was reduced from 24 down to 11 percentage points, and the gap in math fell from 16 percentage points to six. These achievements will be featured in our spotlight on education during our October the 8th meeting, but I would like to congratulate the outstanding and remarkably talented faculty, staff, students, families, and of course, previous principal Steve Saunders and current principal Seth Kennard for your outstanding work. This is a nationally renowned accomplishment. And as impressive as these numbers are, I know the school's motto will be the best is yet to come. Thank you.\"},\n",

And I would like to take you through the latest updates on the metrics that we have gotten from the Virginia Department of Health. As you can see, this first slide is the seven day floating average of the number of cases per 100,000 people. and see that the numbers have, well, they call this trend fluctuating, but the numbers are lower now than they were in the end of August. And overall, we've been seeing a downward trend with the case burden or the floating average of the cases. The percent positivity rate for testing in Elmar County has been steadily going down. You can see we're down at 3.6%, which is one of the lowest rates we've had at least all summer. That has been decreasing. Now in the city of Charlottesville, it's a little bit different. We have been on an upward trend of number of cases. Some of that can be, I think most of the increase can be attributed to UVA cases. But we wanted to explain that the metrics we received from the Virginia Department of Health are intended to provide a starting point for conversations and decision making. We do not have absolute benchmarks for which people are clamoring. It is, we believe it's important to contextualize the data. For example, UVA does have an impact on the case counts in the city, but not so much on the county. Luckily, we have Ryan McKay with us this evening, and he can help explain some of this data and put it into some context and may be able to answer any questions you have.\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"Ryan? Thank you, Eileen, appreciate that. So, again, my name is Ryan McKay, senior policy analyst for the Thomas Jefferson Health District. And one of the things that we've been looking at closely throughout the pandemic are a lot of the numbers as they relate to positivity rates, the raw data of case counts, and certainly the cases per 100,000, both on a daily basis, but over the course of a 14 day period of time. And I think Eileen hits the point very well in terms of context. what goes into these numbers, what goes into the seven-day positivity trend of 3.6. There are a number of factors that we have to consider when it comes to decision-making, whether it's for schools bringing students back or implementing community-wide mitigation strategies that the Board of Supervisors implemented back in late July and early August. So part of that is understanding where we've been doing testing and where the positive results come from. If we do a point prevalence survey in let's say a long term care facility or at the regional jail. One of the things that we would look for are the total number of positives related to those. Those will drive up many of the numbers in our localities. For example, Fluvanna County was at about 3.2 to 3.4% just over a week ago, and now they're up over 7.4% positivity rate over the last seven days. We can attribute that to one event in the outbreak at the Fluvanna Correctional Facility for Women. Similarly, we can identify increases based on relationships with the university and student transmission there. While we haven't really seen the huge uptick within the county, we can attribute some of the cases and the case incidence rate 100,000 to students who live in the county or cases that are attributable to UVA in general. And so I think it's really important to understand what the background is to some of these testing rates. The other is, and I think it might be a little confusing, sometimes is with the UVA, I'm sorry, the Charlottesville numbers, you notice that they're in bright red. It's at 48 per 100,000, but the positivity rate is below 5%, which is ideal for what we need to do as public health. What that tells us is there's massive amounts of testing going on, and that's not just limited to UVA testing students and faculty. That goes to community testing that's happening throughout Albemarle County and Charlottesville and throughout the health district on a daily and weekly basis. The more we test, the greater access that we provide to that testing, and the more frequently we do that, the idea is that we want to find those cases. We want to make sure that we can isolate individuals who test positive, that we can identify their close contacts, those who are within six feet for more than 15 minutes at a time, who may need to quarantine and monitor for symptoms themselves. And that's really critical, because from our perspective, we want to make contact with those individuals within 24 hours. The more we can do that, the more likely it is that we can contain, not just mitigate. Difference being mitigation slows the spread, containing stops it. From our perspective, one of the important data points that isn't necessarily publicly released is our ability to do that within 24 hours. And we feel pretty confident that we can do that consistently at or above the 95% rate. So I think the context behind the data is important. And as Eileen mentioned, it's a starting point for a broader discussion to determine what the risk may be. We heard often tonight about safe. And I think that's really hard to define. What we can better define is potential risk involved. And what are we doing, not just in relation to the positivity rates and the case counts, But what are we doing holistically as a community to mitigate and minimize risk? It goes to wearing the face masks, physically distancing, doing symptom checks as a whole system as opposed to just focusing on what the percent positivities are. We have examples within our health district and within the state of schools that have opened at varying levels of positivity rates, at varying levels of cases per 100,000. And I think what it's important is to, yes, look at those data points as a part of the conversation, but also understand what the ability is of a school system to implement the strategies that are going to reduce and minimize risk to the greatest extent possible. So with that, I'm happy to answer questions about the data, about indicators, and any other questions you have about COVID-19 from the public health perspective.\"},\n",

It wouldn't be at a current, with the current number of outbreaks or the current number of cases within a school that occurred associated with that outbreak. But we will be able to at least show the cumulative number of outbreaks on our public facing dashboard. I think the other part of that is those weekly calls school systems have reported that a case has occurred, based on media reports, they've been asked to share details in terms of how was the process to identify close contacts. what were the lessons learned from those experiences. And then we can also share about process and procedure and protocol so that other school systems can learn from those responses to those individual cases and then make adjustments accordingly based on their own plans.

But the impact of UVA coming back to grounds has been less impactful on the county than it has been on the city.

We use them to determine where we may need to identify testing locations and conduct outreach in terms of information and education about COVID, ways to minimize and reduce risk, and certainly minimize spread. There are zip code level data available through a couple of different sites that can be found.

I'm not a fan of these Zoom meetings. I'm like trying to minimize and it's like maximizing, like talking into my blank screen. I guess I'm just asking if there's a way for you to provide an opinion on whether you think that schools are a place where risk would be low or where we could conceivably make risk lower.

I would appreciate your opinion if you could provide it.\"},\n",
       " {'speaker': 'nospeaker',\n",
       "  'text': \"Of course, yes. I believe there are ways that it can be done, and I've seen it. I visited Louisa County Public Schools about two weeks ago and got a tour of their middle and high school from their superintendent, Doug Straley, who showed me every step of the way of how they have worked to minimize and reduce risk to the extent possible, from the screening procedures that they have how they do symptom checks and temperature checks, how they have students enter various parts of the building based on grade level, and how they've cohorted students. Now I will say a lot of what's occurred and what we're hearing is that this is pretty common across Virginia. is that they're able to decompress the number of students who are doing in-person education. So they had about a one-third of parents decide to keep students home for full virtual education, so that left them with two-thirds of their school system attending school in person. I believe they're on an AB schedule. And so while school doesn't look like school in terms of the numbers and what a classroom looks like, they have been very successful at bringing students back, implementing policies such as face masks, putting markers on the floor, stickers on the floor as reminders of how to do physical and social distancing. Six feet can be sort of hard to navigate if you're standing in a line without that visual reference. So the strategies they put in at both levels have been pretty remarkable to see. And I'll be honest, I had a hard time getting my head around what a school looks like during COVID and how you can minimize risk to the extent possible. And they've done a tremendous job. And they've also had some strong protocols as it relates to What happens if we've identified an individual with COVID who's a member of the school community? What do we do in terms of information sharing, contact tracing, and then education following that to ensure that we've identified as public health all the people that may have been a close contact and that we've done everything we can to contain potential spread? And so they've been a very good example. I know Greene County opened a couple of weeks ago. My understanding is Dr. Hawes talked to Andrea Whitmarsh, their superintendent, and we've heard nothing but good things there. In fact, Greene County visited Louisa County just to get an idea of what was happening. And they've been very open about what didn't necessarily work to begin with and what they've adjusted on the fly to make those operations, again, with low risk or minimizing risk to the extent possible. I will say it's important to keep in mind that as schools open, whether it's Albemarle County or Charlottesville or anywhere in Virginia, We have to anticipate there may be a case that emerges, and we have to understand that our response to that is going to impact whether or not we contain spread, mitigate spread, or if spread moves forward. And so that planning process, that constant review of those plans, and learning from others, along with looking at the community data, is going to be an ongoing process. It's evolving. But again, to reiterate to your original question, yes, I believe it can be done in a way that minimizes risk to the extent possible, as long as there's a sort of a systems approach to that in combination with what we can provide and share through data and context around that data.\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"Good evening school board members. Thanks Rosalyn for the introduction. So I will jump right into our agenda for today. Our work session will be divided into three sections based on our desired targets. And they are to understand the COVID-19 impacts on the CIP process and current appropriation, to prepare you all for the joint board of supervisors work session that's scheduled for October 21st, And then finally, to provide guidance to the Long-Range Planning Advisory Committee for long-term facilities planning. As you can see, the first part will be for information. I will pause for questions after the first session. And then the second and the third sections really are discussions for you all to discuss amongst each other with staff and the committee members about capital projects. Before we begin, I want to clarify our multi-year CIP process. This is important, particularly this year, as we will be making more decisions than we would in a typical year about capital projects. The first part of the projects are FY 2020, so that's last fiscal year's carry forward projects. So any previously adopted and appropriated projects can be carried over if those projects are not complete into the current FY 21 fiscal year. In a typical year that happens automatically if the project isn't finished, but this year you will see that it wasn't completely automatic. Then we have the FY 2021 capital budget. That's the current year we're in. That budget was adopted last spring and funds for that were appropriated. However, there may be budget amendments in the current year that adjust the budget that was adopted back in the spring based on a better revenue picture that we, not necessarily a better revenue picture, but better revenue information that we will get later this year. Next, we have the FY22 capital budget, which is next year's capital budget. And we plan for that during the budget planning process the year before. So this is the year that we are planning for next year's capital budget. In addition, we will also be planning for, through FY 2025, we will not be adding a fifth year to our previously adopted five-year capital program, CIP, and instead we will just shift forward a year and plan a four-year CIP. That is the current planning. And then the year after that is the fiscal year 23 and beyond period. This is really what we're calling the long-range planning aspect, and this is what the Long-Range Planning Advisory Committee is currently focused on. You may remember that last year we designed a more transparent and streamlined process for the CIP decision-making. We worked very closely with local government and aligned a lot of our meetings and decision points. It was a very successful budget process, and I'm sure you will see this again during the next budget cycle when we plan for FY23. For planning for FY22 purposes, since it is a CIP amendment year and we're in an unusual year, our process will look quite different, and I'll go over that a little bit later. different topic areas. The ones that were approved by the, not approved, but recommended in the County Executive's recommended budget are highlighted here in red. So that's the Crozet addition and improvements and the Mountain View expansion and site improvements. And that recommended budget was put forward in February of 2020, so right before the pandemic. I want to next turn you to an update on where we are with our current budget and appropriation in order to understand the baseline from which we're working from. As you know, our maintenance and replacement program is broken out into three categories. They are school bus facilities and technology, For school bus replacement, our full remaining balance from last year was carried forward. But as you can see, the FY21 budget has been reduced from what was originally recommended in the February budget, the recommended budget. The main change would just be that the replacement cycle for school buses is now delayed. we are able to move forward with a couple essential purchases with the amount that was appropriated. For facilities maintenance, the balance that was remaining from the previous year, some of that was cut with only essential projects moving forward. And that same justification was used to reduce the FY21 budget between the recommended and the adopted. As you can see, technology projects are fully funded at this point. This next list are the one-time CIP projects. The majority of these, as you can see, are FY20 or projects that were previously appropriated. The list that says unfunded, that was the amount that may, in a typical year, be carried forward and reappropriated into the are able to get more information later in the year. The column that- You froze just a minute.\"},\n",

We will get into some of these projects a little bit later, but at the top, you do see the FY20 projects. The FY21 projects is the only project there is the Crozet addition. That project was originally in the recommended budget back in February. But when the budget was revised for adoption, that project was not included. However, the design for that was already funded. So those monies have been appropriated for the current year. So I'm going to turn these next few slides over to Rosalyn.\"},\n",
       " {'speaker': 'rosalynschn',\n",
       "  'text': \"Thank you. So I'm just going to highlight three of those bigger projects just to give you a little more information on them. The first is High School Center 2. As it was stated in that last slide, the design money for that project was carried forward, but the construction as of this point has not. So that's a decision point that the school board and the Board of Supervisors have to make. And I draw your attention to that because as the schedule that we have outlined for that, we have bidding and construction starting next summer. And so what that means is that if this part, the construction money for this project does not get added to the FY21 budget, this project would be delayed. The next slide. Similarly, with the Crozet addition, we do have design underway. Next slide, yeah. Design underway, you will see the design develop, you approve the schematic in July and you'll see the design development portion of that project at your next meeting in October. And as you will see, to keep this project on schedule, we would need to bid and contract in the January, February timeframe of 2021. So again, if the FY21 budget does not get amended to include the construction, which it does not have right now, this project would also be delayed. And then the third project, I just want to keep on our forefront as well as the Mountain View expansion. So that was originally in the recommended CIP for FY 22. And then when everything was revised, it was taken out. So as you recall in Maya's timeline, decisions for this year are going to affect both 21 and 22. So we want to make sure that this project doesn't get lost in the shuffle as well. And I share that all knowing that those are very large projects, and we know that revenues will certainly be uncertain and limited. So we have to be realistic about it. But I did want to make sure that we keep all of these projects, in addition to our maintenance and replacement, restoration on our radar.\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"Thanks, Rosalyn. I'm going to shift gears a little bit now to student enrollment. These numbers here, I'll go through each column, but the first column is showing our original capacity calculations. We have not adjusted those for K-12. The second column here is showing the September 9th actual enrollment data, which was shared with you earlier this month. The third column is showing the the original projections for the current year. So what we thought we were going to get in terms of enrollment for this fall. And then the last column is showing the fifth year of those original projections. The purpose of this is to show you that while our enrollment is lower currently than what we anticipated, and it's still fluctuating every day, there are still some schools that are noted in red where the enrollment does exceed the current capacity. So I'll just give you a minute to look at that. The Red Hill and Scottsville capacities do include the additional space as a result of the current renovations. So looking forward, we have begun the planning process for developing enrollment projections, our 10-year enrollment projections. We have decided at this time, as you know, we are pushing the entire operating budget process. We're delaying that by about a month for each step of the way. So we are going to mirror that in the enrollment projections. That extra time will buy us more time to collect more data and to really look at our methodology to see what will be most appropriate to move forward with these projections. I think most importantly, we will be working with a lot of our partners, which we have previously, but there will be a special focus on this year. So that'll be the Weldon Cooper Center, who we've worked with in the past to develop enrollment projections. We will make sure to connect with principals and OAs who know the most what's happening in their schools and their communities. We're gonna do a deep dive with the Long-Range Planning Advisory Committee about what our methodology will be. And as always, we will partner closely with the Community Development Department and local gov, and we will turn to industry best practices or as much as they can be developed throughout this fall and winter. We will do a deep analysis by school, by grade level, by feeder patterns to really determine, to really understand what happened this year, and we will do as much data collection as we possibly can. And then finally, we will. Flex where we are currently and then an upper end that better reflects our status quo where we would have been before the pandemic. And again, the focus for the range will be that we may use a different set of projections, whether it's for operating resource allocations for the short term, or whether it's facilities planning for the long term. We'll sort of need that wiggle room and that range to really make the best decisions. So that's the first part of the agenda to understand where we are and what's happening.

We knew that we wouldn't need the construction money anytime soon, so it was paused. And same with the Crozet. And that's why they we were able to fund the design and not the construction.

What should be our high level focus be for this year's process? So this is thinking short term for FY21 and FY22. We're hoping that you'll discuss why you think that area of focus is important, or maybe it's that you need more information that we can provide you over the next month. So these are the groups. We have discovered a collaborative tool called Jamboard, and we'll be sharing that link with you. And it's basically a virtual way to have, you know, a poster with stickies and notes the way you would in a real work session. Hopefully, you will find that interesting. We will have staff in each of the groups to help facilitate if you have any questions. So at that point, I think, Jennifer, we are ready for our groups.\"},\n",

But So in terms of what we were looking at for our focus for this year's budget, we talked about a lot of things. Maybe I can't read, but I'm you know, focus on Center 2. If it's going to be early capacity, there's an importance to Crozet Elementary and to Mountain View because they're busting at the seams. And so, let me just take that down. And it all came down to money for, well, for me, that if we had the money to work with in order to work on capacity. That if we didn't, no, we would work on capacity. But if we didn't, then potentially modernization of our existing facilities could be a place to put our CIP money for a year and hopefully get back up to to the regular numbers. But the number one thing and the big idea of it was we got to solve capacity issues. We talked about a number of things in there. One of the reasons for the school center too was that it was promised in the 2016 school referendum because if we all remember that was In addition to the Woodbrook project, it was the big project to be able to provide a relief from a capacity for Albemarle High School and Western Albemarle High School. And they were still going to need that capacity release. And one point that was made that was so important is that space is increasingly important. during the pandemic because of the spacing needs. And if we don't have the capacity, we can't do that. And if we could just slide it over, I can see what that last line was. Or is this the last we had?\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"No, go ahead. So I would say, I think on the Jono's slide, group one slide, the big idea was solving capacity issues. And I think we would be in agreement with that for this year, given that there are so many unknowns and uncertainty and whether there's even going to be any money forthcoming, that would be the focus that we had is just making sure we have space for our students in our most overcrowded areas. That being said, We, well, we had topics for the long range planning. So that's actually for the next section. We did have a few discussions. Center two was not as high on our priority list overall. We also, a little contrary to what group one said about how spacing is increasingly important. We actually were having some conversations about how schooling might look different in the future, given the long range impacts of COVID and virtual learning and the opportunities that have kind of opened up with that. And so I think in our minds, we were kind of, focusing more on the elementary schools. And I would be remiss if I didn't say it's particularly in the Southern Peter Patrick. Graham.

I think both groups were starting to talk More long range because I think in some cases that's the long range is more certain than the short term, which is really backwards, but I so it's a really good point to I think go to the next part of our work session. So our last part of the discussion, again, will be with the Long-Range Planning Advisory Committee members. I want to thank those that are here. They have been online since the beginning of the meeting at 6.30, so thank you. Just as a quick reminder, the Long-Range Planning Advisory Committee exists to inform and advise both the school board and the superintendent in developing a long-term facilities planning needs. Over on the right, you see some examples of the topics that they are charged with. If you want to get a sense of the scope, you can see the scope is pretty large and creative. And I know that group one even started talking about some of that. So I think that this year, this committee is going to be very important in providing you with recommendations next summer. But to begin with, the committee is looking for you all to provide guidance to them as we just started meeting for the school year. We will meet for the full school year and come back to you with whatever guidance that you have given them. Here are the members most, I think, present. So if you all could maybe unmute and, whoops, unmute and turn your videos on and just give a quick introduction to yourself to both the school board and the public, so that we know who you are for those in attendance today.

Also the capacity issues, once we follow out with what happens with both. Crozet and Mountain View, and then looking at whatever else comes next with that. Second piece was modernizing our existing facilities, both to take advantage of modern technology, modern teaching techniques, but also to be able to deal with whatever the next Black Swan event is, whatever the next pandemic type thing might be, so we can be better prepared if we can, right? So it's just one of those things. And then lastly, to try and do it with an eye toward equity to make sure that all our students are getting the best opportunity they can to start once they get into that building, once they get into whatever facility we happen to be using for them, so that we're not, everybody's got the best opportunity to succeed.\"},\n",

And we also talked about flexibility for the future, if that, you know, is sort of out of the box thinking in terms of mixing virtual learning with in-person learning, possibly as a way to solve capacity issues.

And looking at last year, the Long Range Planning Committee talked about a middle school study. It was on our to-do list. We haven't done it. But with Mountain View, close to 700 students, And without space to expand, we actually do need to tackle that problem area at some point. So that's what is the right size for elementary schools? What are we going to do about Mountain View? And how does that fit in with the study of our middle schools? And then because I think there's an opportunity to look prospectively, it is long range planning. is I would like the Long Range Planning Committee to consider looking at the Lambs Lane campus. It is with the school with Albemarle, Greer, Jack Jewett, and soon to be a Boys and Girls Club. It has terrible traffic patterns. It has both the transportation and gas station and building services. But there's an opportunity, I think, to rethink that campus and look at what it could be, even if it's not tomorrow, if it's a 10-year plan. How could we improve that campus and maybe take advantage of some of the parcels that we have proffered to the county and the schools?

       "    'content': \"The total number of educators hired is 124, which is about 60 fewer teachers than the previous two years. Taking into consideration that we have hired fewer teachers this year, most of the categories are consistent with numbers from the previous two years. We continue to have a highly educated cadre of instructional staff members, with most having a master's degree. This year, we hired 89 teachers with master's degrees, or 72% of the total number of teachers hired. Prospective candidates that we talk with during job fairs, recruiting events, and daily interactions continue to state that they are attracted to ACPS because of the emphasis placed on innovation, project passion-based learning, cutting-edge technology, equity initiatives, and diverse programming to support the whole child. Candidates continuously seek out opportunities with ACPS, whether starting out as clinical interns, practicum students, or student teachers, or even possibly stepping into a teaching assistant position to gain valuable experience in pursuit of becoming a teacher. Candidates are enthusiastic, engaged, and highly motivated about their prospects of joining the ACPS team. Our work and emphasis regarding new hires has been to increase the numbers of minority educators across all levels. This year, we hired a total of 20 minority teachers, or 16% of the total number of teachers hired. Looking more closely at the minority breakdown, we have the greatest number of hires for the Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino categories, followed by Asian and two or more races. At the beginning of last school year, the HR team met with the administration of each school to discuss their student-teacher demographics, as well as their specific goals around minority hiring. We had great conversations with administrators. where all emphasize the importance of having diverse, quality instructors in the classroom, which is key to increasing student achievement and impacting the overall dynamics in the school. They also express that having students exposed to more diverse teachers in our classrooms positively impacts all students. Although hiring was not as robust as the previous two years, several schools did have an opportunity to increase the diversity of their teaching staff. Early spring of this year, we offered four early contracts, one of which declined the offer to stay close to home due to COVID-19. Prior to the pandemic, we were on track with minority hires, and by April, we had already hired five minority teachers. The next slide shows the hiring trends and focus areas. Although the minority category at 16% is down slightly from last year's 17%, it seems to be moving consistent. The first year teachers increased slightly to 32% and the total number of applicants increased to 1,074 in comparison to previous years. The overall candidate pool was 11% minority and our new hires were 16% minority, which resulted in drilling down farther in this year's candidate pool. We believe this is attributed to administrators emphasis on increasing diversity within the teaching ranks to better align with student demographics. In addition, the HR team piloted a research-based assessment tool, EPI, or Educator's Professional Inventory. This assessment tool measures strengths in key areas such as teaching skills, cognitive ability, attitudinal factors, and overall qualifications, proven to most accurately predict teacher effectiveness. The tool has allowed the Human Resources Office to target high-performing teachers to recruit, establish relationships and connections with prospective candidates, as well as provide an early opportunity to pull groups of potential candidates together for principal initial screenings. The tool is only one component of a candidate's application. However, the EPI score has provided administrators additional information to utilize in their total assessment of a candidate. We value the importance of having high-quality, diverse educators in the classroom, and we will continue working to address our current demographic data, implementing various strategies to increase minority percentages to better align with student demographics. We continuously focus our energies on increasing the numbers of applicants in job pools. Early childhood special education, special education, dual language, part-time, and late vacancy positions. Specifically, working to recruit and secure quality candidates for hard-to-staff areas, such as early childhood special education, science, special education, and dual language. Lastly, continuing efforts to cast a wider net around minority recruitment, hiring, and retention. The next slide provides information regarding administrator promotions and transfer moves of current Albemarle County staff members. This year, we had seven promotions and five transfers. Similar to the reduction in the number of new teacher hires, we had fewer administrator vacancies. So there were fewer opportunities for transfers and promotions. All of the positions we hired for considered both internal and external candidates. Our internal candidates continue to perform at much higher levels in comparison with similar candidates from other divisions. The investment in mentoring, professional development, and overall training by the division has provided employees opportunities to professionally learn, grow, and explore their own interests and passions. resulting in their successful pursuit of career advancement. The information presented this evening is preliminary, and we plan to bring back to the board next month our annual plan with the final data for this hiring season. The last slide highlights two new energetic instructors who have joined the ACPS family. I had the opportunity and pleasure last year to sit and talk with two African-American teaching fellows, Kendi O'Reilly and Markel Woodson, during the beginning of the year breakfast for the AATF program. Both were extremely excited about the upcoming year as a fellow, experiencing student teaching and pursuing a job opportunity for the upcoming school year. Kendia completed her student teaching at CAEL. She's a UVA graduate, and she did a wonderful job in kindergarten. She even served as a kindergarten teaching assistant as part of the Albemarle Fellows Program. Several principals were in hot pursuit of her. She had several offers, and I remember having a conversation with her discussing FIT, exploring school culture, and administrative support. She thought deeply about the opportunities and decided to join the team at Baker Butler Elementary. What is most interesting about Marquel, both John and I advocated hard for Marquel to complete his student teaching in the county. He grew up in Fulvanna and has ties there, which is understandable why he would want to student teach there. We even talked to his Longwood professor, during a diversity conference at VCU early spring, where Markell was already establishing connections and relationships in the county. He served as an academic coach, bus driver, and substitute teacher. He shared with me that he really, really wanted to be a part of the ACPS family. We are very fortunate to have both Kendia and Markel as part of our team. I spoke with them after the first day of school and they both stated that they had a great day and they look forward to all the wonderful experiences throughout the year. We have captured quotes from them that are listed on the slide regarding their first day of school.\"},\n",

We fortunately just received notice today, as a matter of fact, from the delivery company that they will arrive at our office by 4 p.m. on Monday. As you know, our order that we placed in July was out of stock in the United States and is coming from China. And we were unable to track it. Apple could not give us any kind of tracking information. So we've been operating completely in the dark, but did get word today. So we have already plans in place to have staff working every night next week until 10 p.m. to try to process those as quickly as we can.

For me, it would be underrepresented populations at school board meetings. And then as a other, promote and diversify board appointed committees in Samuel Miller District. Quite often, even though we have good appointees, good people that have been applying for positions, I would still like to have maybe a pool that would be able to sort of have more diversity or candidates that would be more diversified to put on some of the committees. And this would be one way, I think, to do that. Now, moving down a little bit more, I think where it gets to the context that you would make. Probably the main contacts I'd be looking at right now would be the PTOs, especially for the two smaller schools in Samuel Miller District, which would be Red Hill and Scottsville, although Scottsville is in the Scottsville District. but still students from my district go there. I'd also be probably looking at the Yancey Community Center group and also probably contacting social service department in order to find out more data that could be used to sort of invite certain groups from the minority group and from the low-income group to that meeting. So those would be the main things and then I'd probably be looking or trying to start this probably in the middle of April right after spring break. So that would be typical answers to the survey for me as an individual. So are there any questions or any of things else or either returning it back to Dr. Harrison, Harrison for other comments?\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"Good evening again. This is my last item tonight. And this is about work session topics for the remainder of the calendar year. So we formed a work session committee, it was comprised of staff and representative board members, including Miss Lee and Mr. O'Carroll. We have drafted topics for the remainder of the calendar year. Before we get into the topics, I want to first start with the purpose of work sessions. The school board implemented the use of work sessions to gain greater understanding of critical issues facing the division and to provide staff with direction and support in the division's strategic plan. So in other words, work sessions are an opportunity for deeper work. And typically, the first meeting of each month is a business meeting, and then the second meeting is a work session. The committee has drafted a common framework for each work session outlined here. All work sessions will have a direct connection to the strategic plan. They will be data-driven, connect to current policies, and then all will conclude with a common discussion and ensure clear purpose and direction with questions such as, what further information does the board need? What are the next steps for the board on that topic? And always tying back into our funding and budget cycle as well. So there are six remaining scheduled work sessions in the calendar year. And so for each, you will see a date, a topic, and then the connection to the learning for all goal and strategy or objective. And so the first three, which will take us to the end of the school year are listed here. Our next work session is on March 24th, and that will be on what we're calling the first part of two that are focused on achievement data. And the topic will be a mid-year data review. In April, we propose a work session on the CIP. This will be a more global approach on the process and program as a whole and not about specific projects and will be an opportunity to better understand how the county assesses affordability, forecasting, financing options, as well as how we produce enrollment projections and other data. In May, we will plan a session about school climate and mental health. This will include information on student climate data, our counseling and SEL programs, instructors, such as responsive classroom, design development, and freshman seminar. As we come back from summer, right, in August, we will start with a session about intervention services, and that will include RTI, SPED, ESOL, and our title programs. In September will be the second part of the achievement data discussion and that will focus on the year end data. It will also be an opportunity for the board to develop their goals for the 22-23 school year. And lastly, we will conclude with the work session about school board, community and stakeholder engagement. We're still working on the details of these, but we've talked about a deeper dive on the role of advisory committees, perhaps reflection on the work of the work you just discussed or other topics. So with that, I will ask if there's anything Mr. O'Carroll or Ms. Lee would like to add or expand on and then open it up for discussion and feedback.\"},\n",

This last year, it doesn't feel good. But getting into really comparing ourselves to ourselves is where the rubber hits the road. And there are some things, I mean, I'm looking at the life after school numbers that I think were 3.84, 4.2, and four out of five. That's 76%, 80, 84, 80, 80%. So it's like a mid C, two low Bs, and a mid B. And so they're obviously, if you just do it on a percentage basis based on five. And so, you know, I really am looking forward to seeing what that's going to become over the next couple of years, because that's one that we can compete against ourselves. But I will tell you that the equity dashboard, and for anybody listening in who's never really paid attention to it, is one of the great tools that the school division has developed where none of us can run, none of us can hide. It is what it is. And these numbers are not great for this past year, understandably so in many ways. But I love the transparency and the standing up and taking accountability and responsibility. Thank you.\"},\n",

But I think that the way that we present that data obscures the magnitude of that inequity and I am not suggesting that that's purposeful but I think that that can be an outcome of that. What I did appreciate about this presentation that you gave tonight was that you did have that one slide. that showed the actual disparity with like the 77% of reading and whatever 65% of whatever the math, I think. And then, so you could see, really, where the big disparities were and truly the magnitude of them and so I just think that while our equity dashboard does share the type of information and the actual real numbers, and I do appreciate that, I think that when they're calculated based on the whole, and you have to do the math of like, okay, so this is 4%, but there are 7%. So you have to sort of think, you just have to do a lot of backward math to figure out what the true magnitude of the disparity is. So I would, put in a pitch for changing it such that we can actually see more easily the magnitude of the inequity.\"}]},\n",

We're just starting the fiscal year when we're looking at this. This financial report runs from July through September. And so we just have a snapshot of our expenses during this time period. This is going to be the first year in a while in which we've started off the year with a full set of operations and a full set of students. We are still under hold harmless provisions from the state. So in terms of the numbers of students that come in, it will not affect state revenues. So state revenues will be relatively flat during this time period, at least in terms of what's planned, regardless of the numbers of students that are either increased or decreased. We still do anticipate some lower school revenues, local revenues than we had originally budgeted. But we think that there will be some additional discussion during the General Assembly in which there will be potentially new revenues coming from the state, because the state revenues are at historic levels. And we also have heard that local revenues are extremely strong as well. county revenues and we do think that in terms of the revenue picture that our overall revenues are very likely to be strong for this current fiscal year. We take a look at our expenditures for this fiscal year. Our expenditures, we anticipate to be very similar as to what we've had in the past. Probably better expenditures, probably still fairly strong savings in terms of our overall compensation and benefits, probably not as strong as what we saw during the height of the pandemic because we are returning back to school and we did hire more staff, but we're still having some difficulties in terms of hiring staff. Uh, and, um, so it is very likely that we will see some compensation savings, uh, during this fiscal year. Uh, in terms of our overall operational savings, we still do, uh, have pandemic related, uh, delivery item delivery issues in, in the division. So we may see some savings in those areas as well. So overall right now. with this snapshot of just the first three months of operation for the division, we do think that we're going to be very, very strong in this fiscal year. We do have a very strong fund balance. If you look on the last sheet, it's basically a repeat of what you've seen in the fiscal year 2021 fund balance report. We do have a very strong fund balance, but we're probably also going to have a very good fiscal year this current fiscal year. And I believe if there are any questions, I'd be happy on fielding these questions. Otherwise, I was going to turn this over to Dr. Hollins.

The third option, I think, could get a little bit more complicated depending on who you wanted to extend the school year for, but we also know that as we move through the year, we may have some better revenue pictures or so that, you know, we could make those decisions a little later on as we go forward. We've also, I mean, as we start thinking about this, This could, you could think about something like this if you were to limit the number of students in school every day. So if you looked at some of the models that we're seeing in other countries, not every child is coming every day. So you might have half the students coming one day or 20% of the students coming.

       "    'content': \"Yes, good afternoon board members, Pat McLaughlin chief of strategic planning, and I'm here with my Akuma Zawa to to lead you through our work session today. And we've really got three parts of this work session that we're going to work through. The first is going to spend a little bit of time thinking back to Dr Haas's presentation from last month to unpack the state of the division report. Then around five o'clock, we're going to hear a little bit about our budget assumptions and expenditure considerations. And then finally, we're going to have some board discussion and breakout groups around budget priorities for the coming fiscal year. So just to frame up a little bit, why do we talk about the state of the division and the budget at the same time and really it's because we've got a cyclical process that we've that we've started over the past couple of years. So it all kind of begins with the budget, and each year the board puts together a budget and within their list the priorities and the goals that they have for the division. And recently we've started using that budget document to directly help inform our school improvement and our department improvement plans. So when you take a look at those. You should see, for example, every department in the budget has outlined some kind of some things that they're looking ahead to in the future in that budget, and you should see how they're going to put those into practice in their department improvement plans. At the end of that school year, the departments report back to us and that report becomes the state of the division. And the state of the division looks at what's working well for us, but it also highlights some areas where we could continue to use some improvement. And that should then start the next cycle where we go back to the budget and start to think about what are the programs that we want to continue and what programs might need some additional support or be abandoned or, you know, what makes the most sense in terms of our fiscal priorities for the year. And so today, we're gonna spend a bit of time unpacking the State of the Division. You heard a pretty comprehensive report on the State of the Division last month from Dr. Haas, and we're gonna just use that to kind of prime the pump a little bit and refresh our memories to really go into the heart of our work today, which is around the budget priorities. And so if you recall the state of the division report is pretty comprehensive it's it's about 70 plus pages long. And so we clearly won't have won't have time to read through the whole thing. But I would, what I would encourage you to do when we do our first activity is take a look at the table of contents what stands out to you is it the equity report is it human resources is it reports from our individual departments that you want to take a look at. And we are going to open up a jam board for you all if you remember that those are those boards where you can move. some post-it notes back and forth. And the first thing that we want you to do is just individually take a look at the state of the division and start identifying areas in the state of the division that you think are strengths for the division, what we're doing well, weaknesses, areas where we could improve, opportunities, what are some trends that are out there right now that we could take advantage of, and what are some threats to the division meeting our goals. While you're reading through that, and you and you identify those strengths and weaknesses and opportunities and threats, write a post it note and post it on the jam board and put it into the correct quadrant. up on the board, you'll see that you've got the link to the state of the division report, and this is what your jam boards going to look like, just to remember you're all going to be working off of the same one. And there's going to be multiple pages to this board that you can get to up here, the rest of the pages pages two through five are going to be a second activity that we do with Miss kumizawa when she comes on for her part, but just to remember to add a sticky note, you click over here on the sticky note icon, you type your message that you want in there, and then you click Save, it'll appear on the board, and you can move it all around. You can change colors. I know we've got some board members who really like to personalize and put their own colors on there. For this activity, I'm going to ask you to keep them all yellow, because in the second part, we're going to do a group activity where the colors are going to become more important. So for 10 minutes, take a look at the State of the Division. And I will drop our presentation for today into the chat in just a second. And you can access the State of the Division through that presentation. There's a link there. And you can access the Jamboard through that link. Stop sharing my screen for a second so I can get this into the chat. I'll put a direct link into the jam boards to that first link is the state of the division. The second link will take you to the jam board. And I'll go ahead and put the state of the division link in there too, just to make things easy. And then the third link. is the state of the division. And so I'm going to step back. It's 436. We'll go until about 446. I'll put the jam board up so that everyone who's tuned into the meeting can see what you're putting on there. But your charge over the next 10 minutes is to identify a few strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.\"},\n",

We do anticipate a handful of people that aren't going to be able to come back to work, but we're hopeful that it's not a large number.\"},\n",

A later start date would allow for that to happen.

The majority of the school systems in Virginia run on a post-Labor-Day start date. And I think, and our staff wanted to test and see what people would think about a post-Labor-Day start date because we believe that we will be getting closer to Phase 3, if not in Phase 3, when Labor Day comes around. So that was the other piece, was to try to open up, not have to open up in Phase 2 if we didn't necessarily have to, and then have to shift then to Phase 3. It could be more efficient. So... I think it's fair, Matt, to point out to the public that don't know this, that we have to obtain a waiver.\"},\n",

Most of the school systems, particularly, the reason I look at it this way, too, is all around Richmond, the school systems start after Labor Day. And so the capitals in Richmond, the governors in Richmond, the VDOEs in Richmond, also on the south side, Peninsula, they all start after Labor Day. So we're all, we're just kind of looking at it that way that how do we get in alignment with moving toward phase three? Now, I do think it's important to ask our community and that's why we did the survey. And I really appreciate the board's patience with us having an established calendar and then coming back and saying, hey, would y'all entertain asking the public? And I'm really grateful to all the families for chiming in and letting us know what you think. I will say that I did discuss, I have been in discussion with a post-Labor-Day start with city school staff from the very beginning of our conversations about this. And I asked if city school staff would be interested in looking at this type of calendar. I understood at that time that there was some interest. They have not asked their community yet through a survey as to whether they would begin after Labor Day or not. I think they might, I think they may, but I obviously have no way of influencing that other than through collaboration. We do have, I am working on scheduling a meeting with our counterparts in the city for next Wednesday to discuss not only the post Labor Day start, but also what we are looking at as we begin to firm up our school site plans around offering instruction to students. I know they had already published some things to their community and I think they're also interested in learning more about what we're gonna be doing. I think it's important to just say those things because I want the board to know that we are trying to coordinate with the city and with what they're doing. If we end up on different schedules, we're gonna work with our staff. We're gonna work with our teachers, with our support staff to make sure that we meet their needs and help them as they make their way back to work.\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"Yes, thank you. Good evening, board members. I'm Pat McLaughlin, chief of strategic planning for the school division. And I'm here tonight to provide a COVID-19 status update. With me tonight, I'm happy to say are Eileen Gomez, our school nurse coordinator, and Ryan McKay from the Blue Ridge Health Department, who can help answer questions and provide some context for tonight's report. So let's get started. As you know, our updates align with the most recent guidance provided to us by the Virginia Department of Health and the Virginia Department of Education. And the first metric that we monitor with our COVID reports to the board is the level of community transmission, which we determine using two factors. One, both of these have jumped to really the highest levels that we've seen since the beginning of the pandemic due to our current Omicron surge. The first figure that we consider is the total number of new cases per 100,000 people in the past seven days. The most recent data we have is from Monday, January 10th. And at that time, our seven day total per 100,000 people was 850.64. To give you a little bit of context around that, you know, the level that the threshold for high transmission is 100. We were typically seeing ranges in the round, you know, just over 100 at the beginning of this surge so so significantly higher. There. The second number that we look at is the percent positivity over the past seven days. That number has also gone much higher than we've seen in the past to 27.98 and that's percentage of an AT tests that come back positive. in our community. So these levels are both in agreement with each other and clearly put us at the high level of transmission in Albemarle County. And as you can see, we are really as the whole Commonwealth at those high levels. The second metric that we monitor is the vaccination rates among eligible school age children and those continue really to be a bright spot for us locally, statewide, and I'm assuming at the national level as well. So in Albemarle County, we've got 61.2% of our five to 11 year olds who have at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccination. For our 12 to 15-year-olds, that number is 93.8%, and for our 16 and 17-year-olds, that is 92.3%. When you look over at our fully vaccinated numbers, for 5 to 11, we're at 46.6%, 87.4% for our 12 to 15-year-olds, and 86.1% for our 16 and 17-year-olds. And the final metric that we look at is the degree to which COVID is impacting our school operations. And as expected with this surge, we're seeing increased numbers of cases as students and staff members return to school from the winter break. Numbers so far this week on the COVID dashboard show 47 students and seven staff cases throughout our school division. We are and will continue to investigate whether any of these cases can be attributed to transmissions within our schools. And while we do not have any indications currently that any of these are school transmissions, as we investigate, that could change. We continue to monitor student absenteeism and numbers for general absences remain slightly elevated with an attendance rate yesterday of just under 93%. To put that in context, our historical average for attendance is about 95%. Where we are seeing an increase this week is with our number of students who are working from home due to quarantine. That number was below 200 prior to the winter break and as of yesterday stood at 554. for the school division. And finally, I'd like to give an update on staff capacity. Beginning on Monday, we have increased our detailed monitoring of teacher absences from once a week to daily reports from each of our schools. So each day schools give us their total number of absent teachers and whether or not those absences are COVID related. This week those those numbers are coming in, kind of in the low 100s, and prior to winter break, they were kind of in the mid 70s. So elevated again there. And, you know, that is probably one of the most significant strains on our system, having teachers out and knowing the challenges of. of finding substitute teachers for them. Just as a reminder that we continue to have confidence that we have strong mitigation protocols in place in our schools, and those greatly reduce the risk of in-school transmission. They include promotion of vaccination, consistent and correct use of masks, physical distancing, enhanced ventilation, handwashing and respiratory etiquette, cleaning and maintaining our facilities, having folks stay home when sick, and contact tracing in combination with isolation and quarantine. And so in addition to our regular COVID update, which was all the previous information that you've seen, I'd like to provide an update and reminder about our COVID dashboard and communications protocols. We've been getting some questions about that this week. Since students have returned to school, we've maintained an ACPS COVID dashboard so that members of our school community can get the most up-to-date information about COVID in our schools as we can possibly provide them. When we are informed of a positive case in one of our schools. Our first priority is contact tracing an immediate notification of anyone identified as a close contact. That is followed by a notification to classmates of that student, and then a general notification to the school community about the case. After all of those notifications are complete, we then update this information on the division COVID dashboard. Because of our priority of direct notification and the increase in numbers we are seeing with the Omicron surge, sometimes there can be a delay of one to two days before those cases appear. on the dashboard. It's also important to note that our dashboard only reflects cases of students who have been positive, while they're physically in our buildings, cases that occurred over winter break with students who did not come to school, or not included on the dashboard. And with each case that happens with our students, guidance on who needs to quarantine and for how long is one of the most common questions that we get. We're working in close partnership with the health department and local physicians around our quarantine protocols. And we feel that we have strong safeguards in place to prevent the spread of disease. A communication is currently being developed that will be sent to all stakeholders in the near future that helps provide additional clarity to those procedures. And finally, tonight I'd like to welcome back Ryan McKay from the Blue Ridge Health District, who can provide the board with some additional information about our local conditions and answer any questions that you may have. Ryan.\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"Thank you and thanks to the board for having me this evening. Again, my name is Ryan McKay, I'm the Director of Policy Planning and COVID Operations for the Health District. And just sort of to reiterate some of the numbers that Dr. McLaughlin had presented, we are seeing by far the largest surge that we've experienced in our community. I would say at this point it's uncontrolled surge. But our focus and our attention really is on more of the high risk or locations that may have potential for spread. So thinking about congregate settings, schools, for instance, is where a lot of our attention is focused so that we could do everything we can to keep schools open, to keep children in classrooms, to keep disease out from locations where it's going to be at risk for those who are most vulnerable. In terms of some recent changes from the CDC, and this really speaks to some of the quarantine and isolation components, the CDC had altered its recommendations for the general population. So isolation reduced from 10 days to five days. in quarantine reduced from 14, 10 or seven days down to five days. Now that's provided that the individual who was in isolation or in quarantine can mask the entire time that they're outside of their home between days six and 10. And what we recognize is that there is still the risk that someone is infectious or that someone can develop disease. between days six and 10 and potentially infect others. So our recommendation to schools throughout the health district and to daycare centers has been to maintain the 10 days of isolation and quarantine, given how quickly Omicron spreads and the volume of numbers we're seeing in the community. Again, to meet the sole goal of keeping our schools open so that students can continue in-person education.\"},\n",

The resulting FTEs assigned are shown beginning on page G18. These FTEs make up, on average, about 94% of a school-based budget. The remaining 6% of the budget is for supplemental pay such as long-term substitute pay and operating budgets, which are managed by principals. Here's a chart that provides a breakdown of per-pupil expenditures by school. This is simply a calculation of the total FY23 school-based budget divided by the projected K-12 enrollment of each school. Per-pupil budgets, as you can see, range between $10,000 and $15,000. These numbers will differ from division-wide per-pupil amounts since departmental costs are not included here. The red line in the middle corresponds to the right axis and shows the total budget amounts.

       "    'content': \"All right. We'll move on next to department-based expenditures. I want to pause for a moment, though, to talk about the vital role that departments play in moving our strategic plan forward. While department FTEs may not necessarily be inside the classroom with our students, they support our goal areas of thriving students, affirming and empowering communities, and equitable transformative resources. While each department is only shown under one goal area on this slide, in most cases, departments align with all of the goal areas as these areas overlap and work together to achieve our mission. Throughout Section E, you will see specific strategic plan objectives that each department supports. These objectives have strategies and projects in place, managed and tracked by departments to push the strategic plan forward. Here's a snapshot of department-based budgets. As you can see, the largest cost departments are building services and transportation services. These include FTEs that represent building maintenance workers and bus drivers, in addition to operating costs such as fuel, tires, school utilities, school leases, and custodial supplies. The technology and fiscal services budgets include non-departmental costs, where costs have not been assigned to specific schools such as furniture replacement or technology licensing costs and other division-wide costs such as transfers to special revenue funds. Finally, we move on to special revenue funds in section F. Special revenue funds contain programs that typically require separate accounting and reporting of revenues and expenses. Many of these programs are funded by federal and state governments or fees. Although the accounting for these programs is maintained separately in the budget book, the provision of these services to students is integrated within our overall school division operations. On this slide, a few of the largest special revenue funds are highlighted. The Child Nutrition Fund is $6.1 million. Fee-based programs like Child Nutrition and EDEP or extended day enrichment programs must cover their expenses by charging fees and updating them each budget cycle to ensure that the rising costs of compensation and supplies are fully covered. Other funds include internal service funds, such as technology replacement, which funds the replacement of student and staff devices among many other items. Grant funds such as Title I are incorporated into the overall staffing at schools. And while the accounting for it is separate, again, the services seen at the school level are combined with school fund operations. Are there any questions about departments or the special revenue funds? All right, I'll move on. I'm assuming that this makes perfect sense to you and that's why there's not any questions. So I just have a couple of slides dedicated to enrollment and demographics. The K-12 enrollment projection for next year is 13,648 students. I'm showing the historical data here as a reminder of some of the wild fluctuations we've seen during the pandemic.\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"In FY20, we saw a stark enrollment increase to over 14,000 students, or 300 students higher than what we had projected. We continued to project an increase in FY21 to reflect the previous year's increase, but that was a year of our largest decline due to the pandemic. As we build towards FY23, we are projecting an increase in actual enrollment as represented by the orange dotted line, but a decrease in budget to budget enrollment as represented by the blue dotted line. We believe that this projection represents growth due to growing development in the county and students returning back to our schools. However, the reality is that homeschooling is increasing and had been before the pandemic and we're using this current year's enrollment as a new baseline. Here, packed onto one slide, are the changes in budget due to enrollment and demographics, with the exception of special education, which will be presented later. The reason why this is shown all together is because these items are related and cannot always be distinguished from each other. First, the budget-to-budget enrollment change. The decreasing enrollment results in 29.4 fewer FTEs for the division based on our current staffing standards. Other smaller changes include a slight reduction due to the Crozet redistricting study that was approved, a modest increase in world languages staffing, and small increases in Center One and ESOL staffing. These increases are offset by the elimination of contingency FTEs that were budgeted in the FY22 budget. After these enrollment and demographic changes, we are proposing to maintain the level of staffing that we have in our schools this year by reducing our staffing ratios by one student. In doing so, we would be adding back the approximately 30 FTEs that are reduced in the top portion of this table. This net change results in an approximately zero FTE change from budget to budget in this category. Dr. Haas presented this class size reduction proposal and the draft funding requests. And I'm here to take any questions that you have about this or other enrollment and demographic changes.\"},\n",

And so the first thing I want to talk about is just our staffing model. And the state requires that there are 20 ESL teachers for every thousand English learners. However, we staff over that model. And our current English learner count is 1509. This includes students who have tested out and are in monitoring phases. And so that's why it may look different than Maya's original number. But when we look at this number holistically, it means that we would need an FTE of approximately 30 teachers. We currently have an FTE of 37 instructional staff. And the reason that we staff over the VDOE model is that there are really three main reasons that it doesn't quite work for us. The first is that it groups all of our English learners as a monolith. However, we know that students at different levels of English proficiency require different levels of support. And so we staff based on a combination of the number of students and their present levels of service and adjust these ratios across grade levels to account for the different learning that newcomers need, whether they enter in elementary school compared to secondary school. The second reason is that the state staffing model does not consider the different number of students at different schools, it treats them as all being at one school, and so our students are spread out across every school in the county, and therefore we want to make sure our staff can service our students across all of these schools. And the last reason is that the state ratio does not take into account the sociopolitical context that we see from our East Hall students, specifically our newcomer students. And our newcomer students are largely comprised of Central American teenagers. And as a result of the recent natural disasters and increased political instability that we've seen in the area, an increasing percentage of these students have interruptions in their formal education. And what this means is that teachers are working to leverage the strengths these students bring to scaffolding content and language learning at the same time to ensure they can meet grade level standards. And our students, as a result of these interruptions, are also coming with increasingly complex trauma profiles, which increases the need for additional staff to support the language acquisition and social emotional learning of our students simultaneously. And so if you look at the next graph, this shows the amount of English learners served by ACPS. And again, this includes our students who are presently classified and our students who have exited but are still being monitored. And so our EL population has increased this year to already exceed the projection from last year. We've enrolled 1,509 students to date. And so based on this data, we project having 1,569 multilingual learners next year. And then if you look at the next chart, it illustrates our FTE allocations for the next year without additional staffing across all of our schools. and this staffing is based on the population at each school. However, our current staffing model means that our urban ring secondary schools are not staffed fully according to the staffing model we use, which is why we seek to rectify this through the addition of an additional FTE. And so the need for additional staffing comes from our increase in newcomer students, the definition of which can be seen on the left. We've received 292 newcomers this year, largely in our urban ring schools. And we know that our newcomer students bring many strengths and to capitalize on these strengths, we need support in addressing the differences in their prior education and the American education system. We've also seen an increase in our newcomers with complex social emotional needs, particularly as we've enrolled 71 students from Operation Allies Welcome.\"},\n",

Again, I hope that provides a good visual for you and for our community around the impact that new and improved space has on the learning environment. I think sometimes visuals are stronger than our words. So while we are proud of the work we have completed, there is a lot of work to still be done. And so the renovation portions of the projects would be in the capital budget, but tonight we would like to also discuss a furniture replacement program, which will be funded by the operating budget. So this draft funding request includes the establishment of a furniture replacement program. This program provides for the replacement of classroom furniture, including tables, desks, storage, seating, and specialty items. The new furniture replaces aged and out-of-date pieces, and when combined with professional development, produces furniture that supports the classroom environment and functionality. So here are just some highlights about the program, looking backward and then looking forward. So next slide, please. So previously, wide-scale furniture replacement efforts were funded by the Learning Space Modernization Capital Project. But as Ms. Kumazawa mentioned, the criteria for capital projects has recently changed, and so this work no longer meets the definition for capital funding, which is why it's now built into our operating request. But similar to Mr. Foreman's comment around the technology replacement program, I think this is a positive. It gives us more control and advocacy for this work. Pre-pandemic, furniture was replaced division-wide in all kindergarten and first grade classrooms. This systematic grade level approach provides parity amongst our facilities. And it has also been an opportunity to provide division-wide professional development to support the work. It's a plan do study act cycle so we involve teachers in the planning and the decision making as they choose from different packages. We install the furniture and then we gather their feedback through use of surveys and observation and we use that information to inform the next grade level. Unfortunately, this work was stalled when the pandemic began and funding was not available. So we are excited to restart this work. And if the funding is afforded in this operational budget, we will replace all second grade classroom furniture for the 23-24 school year. And then each subsequent year, the next grade level will be replaced. We feel that furniture is a functional necessity, and this is a systematic approach to ensure we have a planned and fair replacement cycle amongst all schools.

And so our plan is once we start bringing all the furniture back that's from storage, right, and we will integrate those desks into some of these plans or upper grades. We have very intentionally purchased adjustable heights so they can be used in both elementary and secondary.

       "    'content': \"Good evening. I am proud to be the principal at Greer Elementary School. And our purpose at Greer, which is shared here on this screen, is to change lives in our community and to provide equity and to eliminate achievement gaps. And those are certainly bold goals. And one of the many ways that we work towards achieving those is to use differentiated staffing. I'm grateful to have an opportunity tonight to speak with you, share some information about how we use differentiated staffing at Career. We educate around 500 students from preschool to fifth grade. Our students come from all over the world and they create a unique and diverse community for us. And one of the many ways that we support these students is through the hard work of our amazing staff, some of whom are provided for for us by differentiated staffing formula. This coming school year, we will be using around eight and a half FTEs of differentiated staffing to support our students. So the staffing standards that Ms. Kumazawa was describing are based on enrollment numbers And they don't account for specific school demographics and so some of careers demographics that may not be accounted for on enrollment projections and enrollment formulas. include our poverty level, as well as our students who are transient coming into our school after the school starts and leaving before the end of the year in the past for context. outside of the pandemic or has typically had a poverty level of around 75% as a school. This is important, not only because there's also a causal relationship between poverty and student achievement, but also because our division, as Ms. Kamizawa just pointed out, uses poverty levels as the indicator and the way that they staff for differentiated staffing. In addition, because we welcome students throughout the year, our population changing in that way means that we are regularly adding and sometimes withdrawing students throughout the year. And our differentiated staffing model allows us to prepare for that and to be proactive. Next slide, please. On this slide, you can see the projected breakdown. of our classrooms from kindergarten to fifth grade for next year. At the elementary level, it's important to remember that students largely spend most of their day within their homeroom class or with that cohort of students. As principals, we generally develop both the building logistics as well as the overall staffing plan based on the number of homeroom sections that we will have. Therefore, we start first by creating staffing plans by looking at the overall number of classroom sections or homeroom sections that we'll need at each grade with the goal of creating the smallest class sizes possible. As you can see on the far left section, we're scheduled to have roughly 450 students next year in kindergarten to fifth grade. Through our regular staffing, we're provided roughly 22 classroom teachers. The numbers in sections and the class size averages are noted in the blue column. By using differentiated staffing for positions in this case, we're able to decrease the average class size by increasing the number of homeroom sections. And you can see that in the orange column on the right. In general, principals develop staffing plans, and we meet with our central office staff for their consultation review and approval. This allows each principal to develop plans for the unique needs of that principal's school, and also provides a consistent process across the division about how we utilize our staffing allocations, including differentiated staffing. Next slide, please. This slide provides a general breakdown of how we're planning to use the eight and a half FTE of differentiated staffing for next year. First, as noted on the previous slide, we reduced class sizes by adding in four additional classroom teachers. Next, we used additional staffing to increase physical education, art and PE, and music for teachers. This staffing is necessary because as you add additional classroom sections, you need additional sections of art, PE and music. In addition, We know that students will benefit from PE classes that are smaller, art classes that are smaller, music classes that are smaller. And finally, our students benefit from about 60 minutes of those activities each day. And we know that that impact is large because, as I said, the smaller class sizes. We then added in a second full-time counselor. Our counselors support the social emotional SEL needs of all of our students, even outside of a pandemic. And they're critically important, not only to the well-being of our students, but also the entire school. The staffing standards career receives only one school counselor. The addition of another school counselor through differentiated staffing and the SEL coach position allows us to have three highly trained adults who are able to provide both proactive and in the moment support to our students. We then use another staffing position to hire teaching assistants. We use our TAs in a variety of ways, sometimes to support in the homeroom, sometimes to provide academic support, and then also to help with our transient student population. So, for example, we know in a given year career may enroll hundred new students since the beginning of the year. This year we've we've positioned some of our ta's to help us with new new students when they arrived during the year, so we knew. That we were going to be receiving students who are refugees from Afghanistan and we knew that they may be coming into grades. in which we already had a little bit larger class sizes. And so we could put a teaching assistant in that class to allow either the homeroom teacher some time on the students' first day to interact with the student while the TA would cover some of the class. The TA could also help take the student on a tour of the building. The TA could be associated with the student during the day to help provide immediate support. There are many ways we could do that. And the differentiated staffing that we use with teaching assistants allow us that flexibility. And finally, we also use one staffing position to provide math intervention for our students. As a reminder, as I'm sure you know, our students participate in Title I reading program, receive reading support that way, but we don't receive any math support. And so we use differentiated staffing to provide math support for our students. I recognize as a principal that it's difficult to show quantitatively that this differentiated staffing model may work, but I am confident as a principal that it works for our students. I see it every day. I see it in the stronger relationships that our students and our teachers have because of the smaller class sizes. I see it in the increased opportunities for students to experience art, PE, and music in smaller classes. I see the increased collaboration and professionalism that exists in our school because of the strengthened PLC model. I see it in ways that our two school counselors and our SEL coach meet with our students every day. I see it in the academic gains that our students are making, particularly as we're coming out of our annual mid-year review process and our ability to provide additional math support to students. And I see it in the significant decrease in discipline referrals over time for our students, which tells me that they're more engaged in class and learning.

But I also know that the best way to do that is not by focusing on large numbers, but by focusing on individual students one day at a time. And I know that differentiated staffing allows me and other principals in the county take that vision and to make it a reality at our school every day for every student.

       "    'content': \"Good evening. I am proud to be the principal at Greer Elementary School. And our purpose at Greer, which is shared here on this screen, is to change lives in our community and to provide equity and to eliminate achievement gaps. And those are certainly bold goals. And one of the many ways that we work towards achieving those is to use differentiated staffing. I'm grateful to have an opportunity tonight to speak with you, share some information about how we use differentiated staffing at Career. We educate around 500 students from preschool to fifth grade. Our students come from all over the world and they create a unique and diverse community for us. And one of the many ways that we support these students is through the hard work of our amazing staff, some of whom are provided for for us by differentiated staffing formula. This coming school year, we will be using around eight and a half FTEs of differentiated staffing to support our students. So the staffing standards that Ms. Kumazawa was describing are based on enrollment numbers And they don't account for specific school demographics and so some of careers demographics that may not be accounted for on enrollment projections and enrollment formulas. include our poverty level, as well as our students who are transient coming into our school after the school starts and leaving before the end of the year in the past for context. outside of the pandemic or has typically had a poverty level of around 75% as a school. This is important, not only because there's also a causal relationship between poverty and student achievement, but also because our division, as Ms. Kamizawa just pointed out, uses poverty levels as the indicator and the way that they staff for differentiated staffing. In addition, because we welcome students throughout the year, our population changing in that way means that we are regularly adding and sometimes withdrawing students throughout the year. And our differentiated staffing model allows us to prepare for that and to be proactive. Next slide, please. On this slide, you can see the projected breakdown. of our classrooms from kindergarten to fifth grade for next year. At the elementary level, it's important to remember that students largely spend most of their day within their homeroom class or with that cohort of students. As principals, we generally develop both the building logistics as well as the overall staffing plan based on the number of homeroom sections that we will have. Therefore, we start first by creating staffing plans by looking at the overall number of classroom sections or homeroom sections that we'll need at each grade with the goal of creating the smallest class sizes possible. As you can see on the far left section, we're scheduled to have roughly 450 students next year in kindergarten to fifth grade. Through our regular staffing, we're provided roughly 22 classroom teachers. The numbers in sections and the class size averages are noted in the blue column. By using differentiated staffing for positions in this case, we're able to decrease the average class size by increasing the number of homeroom sections. And you can see that in the orange column on the right. In general, principals develop staffing plans, and we meet with our central office staff for their consultation review and approval. This allows each principal to develop plans for the unique needs of that principal's school, and also provides a consistent process across the division about how we utilize our staffing allocations, including differentiated staffing. Next slide, please. This slide provides a general breakdown of how we're planning to use the eight and a half FTE of differentiated staffing for next year. First, as noted on the previous slide, we reduced class sizes by adding in four additional classroom teachers. Next, we used additional staffing to increase physical education, art and PE, and music for teachers. This staffing is necessary because as you add additional classroom sections, you need additional sections of art, PE and music. In addition, We know that students will benefit from PE classes that are smaller, art classes that are smaller, music classes that are smaller. And finally, our students benefit from about 60 minutes of those activities each day. And we know that that impact is large because, as I said, the smaller class sizes. We then added in a second full-time counselor. Our counselors support the social emotional SEL needs of all of our students, even outside of a pandemic. And they're critically important, not only to the well-being of our students, but also the entire school. The staffing standards career receives only one school counselor. The addition of another school counselor through differentiated staffing and the SEL coach position allows us to have three highly trained adults who are able to provide both proactive and in the moment support to our students. We then use another staffing position to hire teaching assistants. We use our TAs in a variety of ways, sometimes to support in the homeroom, sometimes to provide academic support, and then also to help with our transient student population. So, for example, we know in a given year career may enroll hundred new students since the beginning of the year. This year we've we've positioned some of our ta's to help us with new new students when they arrived during the year, so we knew. That we were going to be receiving students who are refugees from Afghanistan and we knew that they may be coming into grades. in which we already had a little bit larger class sizes. And so we could put a teaching assistant in that class to allow either the homeroom teacher some time on the students' first day to interact with the student while the TA would cover some of the class. The TA could also help take the student on a tour of the building. The TA could be associated with the student during the day to help provide immediate support. There are many ways we could do that. And the differentiated staffing that we use with teaching assistants allow us that flexibility. And finally, we also use one staffing position to provide math intervention for our students. As a reminder, as I'm sure you know, our students participate in Title I reading program, receive reading support that way, but we don't receive any math support. And so we use differentiated staffing to provide math support for our students. I recognize as a principal that it's difficult to show quantitatively that this differentiated staffing model may work, but I am confident as a principal that it works for our students. I see it every day. I see it in the stronger relationships that our students and our teachers have because of the smaller class sizes. I see it in the increased opportunities for students to experience art, PE, and music in smaller classes. I see the increased collaboration and professionalism that exists in our school because of the strengthened PLC model.

       "    'content': \"Thank you, Steve. Thank you for the presentation, Steve. I really appreciate it. And thank you, Miss Lee. What I think is that we can demonstrate using the staffing at the schools. We may not see from year to year perhaps great gains in achievement, whereas achievement is measured one time per year with one test, with an SOL test. However, all of our schools demonstrate growth for their students, particularly students that are behind, even with the SOLs. Ever since Virginia introduced growth as a measure for SOL testing, many of our schools have maintained the very rigorous standards for accreditation by showing growth with their students. I know that when Dr. Saunders was principal at Baker Butler, the way he really began to develop the success of the school was first through growth. And then that led to eventually the Blue Ribbon Award for the school around closing achievement gaps. Much of that accomplished with differentiated staffing at the school. I believe the same thing will happen at Greer. And I believe that as we focus more on growth, which is really a measure of a student moving from where they are at the beginning of the year to the middle of the year to the end of the year, that's where we're going to see the gains that we have. Ultimately, a student coming into school who is behind, who's had interrupted education, or perhaps comes from another nation where they have not been to school at all, they have to make more rapid growth than a typical student. And so I think it's incumbent upon the division, as you said, to develop a way to see that growth and make it more transparent to our community. I fully support what you said, what you suggested. The growth is there. Our students are more successful. They learn a great deal during the year. And we owe it to our teachers and our community to celebrate those successes. Right now, we are holding ourselves accountable to a static one-time-per-year measure. We really need to focus on growth.\"},\n",

They come to the central office with that plan. They meet with a team, including members of our equity staff, our deputy superintendent for instruction, personnel staff, and finance staff. to ensure that the staffing plan that they've developed will align with their school improvement goals to meet the growth goals as well as the achievement goals that they have for the school. It is a shame that after the, as we made our way through the 18-19 school year and really firmed up these procedures and became more consistent than ever, that we came into a pandemic. And many principals have, really been struck by the fact that they were making great progress during the 18-19 school year and 19-20 school year. We could see the growth. And so we have really been thrown off by the past two years of the pandemic. I am looking for next year to be a year of great growth for our students as they return. And I hope the board understands that We do not just sprinkle staffing around the school system, leave it up to the principals to do what they want with it, and then hope for the best of success.

So I understand that there were some questions surrounding SEL counselors. Can you move to the next slide, please? That came up during Dr. Haas's budget proposal. So I'm here tonight to highlight how the SEL counselors help enhance the school counseling program through a combined focus on mental health and social emotional learning. Next slide please. This graphic shows the overlap of some of our school-based mental health professionals. First, I'd like to talk about our school counselors. They are state-licensed school counselors who focus on three core domains, academics, career, and social-emotional learning. Then we have, due to the school board support, we have added our SEL counselors who come from a variety of backgrounds.

We had staff volunteers from administrators to various departments and schools, all levels of organizations serving as our registrars, our screeners, our assistants, traffic control that made this event possible. Most importantly, our school nurses in conjunction with nurses from the city went through training and became our vaccinators. Again, it was just truly a site of collaboration and teamwork that went smoothly today, and we look forward to the next two days. So this initial clinic was at Charlottesville High School. Our plan is to do a site at Monticello High School as soon as next week, assuming doses are available. And for now, we will operate one site at a time, switching between the two, but it is our goal that we would ultimately have both up and running. to get through the remainder of our employees and then second doses as well.

So as you can see, teaching assistants and food service associates are the highest frequency group, along with custodians, special education staff, and transportation staff. In total, we have about 450 current employees with wages lower than $15 an hour. The reason why the price tag on this proposal is so high is because of the effects of compression, which we have to plan for. So in this scenario, which hasn't been finalized, the scenario is to fund decompression through pay grade 12. And listed here are some example positions that you might see in each of these pay grades and how many employees are in each of the pay grades. I'll move on next to salary increase. We do plan on providing a teacher scale increase for next year. and also in partnership with local government, some sort of classified increase or one-time payment for our other employees. I thought it was important to highlight, again, the importance of where we stand next to Charlottesville City Schools. You all know this and have expressed your opinion on this already, but it's important to keep all this in mind as we talk about compensation. The next budget priority area is strategic operational restoration. I've listed here the areas that were cut in our current adopted budget. So we implemented 5% cuts to school and department operating budgets. If we were to restore those, it would cost about $700,000. We also reduced 15 FTEs, operational support, instructional across the division. that equates to approximately $1.2 million. We also paused a transfer to the Learning Resources Fund, formerly called the Textbook Replacement Fund, of half a million dollars. And then finally, in terms of new proposals, we have two listed here this evening for your consideration, both of which are from past conversations we know are your priority, and that is the school safety specialists. By eliminating the transfer for school resource officers, we would be hiring our own positions in the area of school safety that would need to be funded. And then secondly, an expansion of our equity and CRT program that is currently being developed right now. So I didn't hear any questions throughout that. So I'll jump into our bigger discussion this evening, which is reflecting on those budget goals that I shared with you in the beginning of the presentation.

Having said that, all employees' salaries who are making on the lower end of the wage scale, everyone will be lifted, just not necessarily to the 15 if you're a part-time VRS-ineligible employee. So the next phase would include all employees, so we would be raising the part-time VRS ineligible scale to $15 and that would continue to push up the people who were already at 15.

Is that something that they are planning to do? We're developing a list of questions that will become guiding questions that our supervisors will work with their staffs on to determine what their actual needs are. This is something that once we have a better sense of what we talked about, learning more about our students and who's coming back that will also help us help guide us with what we're going to need staff wise to support those. And from there, what we will do is one of the things in the document, it talks about some accommodation and obviously you know virtual is an easy accommodation or relatively easy accommodation for. for teachers, but you're exactly right. That does not apply for other staff members. We've talked about, are there ways to reassign people to other situations that may allow them to do work that they may not have been able to do in their original job? And so those are some of the things that we're wrestling with. One of the things that I think is helpful to know is as we brought people back in for our first phase of our employees coming back into work, at this point, we've only had two people, I believe, that have needed to not come in yet. And so I'm hopeful that I know that right now there's a lot of unknowns and with the not knowing exactly start date and schedule and what school is going to look like, I know that there's a lot of angst for our employees around that.

And one of the things that I also know is that just because a person is in a high-risk category, we can't force them to not work. So one of the things that we're going to have to do as we move forward is we're really going to have to work with our, our intention is for our supervisors to work with the staff, all staff, to determine are there underlying conditions that are going to prevent them from coming into work. if they are they going to feel comfortable coming in? Is that something that they are planning to do? We're developing a list of questions that will become guiding questions that our supervisors will work with their staffs on to determine what their actual needs are. This is something that once we have a better sense of what we talked about, learning more about our students and who's coming back that will also help us help guide us with what we're going to need staff wise to support those. And from there, what we will do is one of the things in the document, it talks about some accommodation and obviously you know virtual is an easy accommodation or relatively easy accommodation for. for teachers, but you're exactly right. That does not apply for other staff members. We've talked about, are there ways to reassign people to other situations that may allow them to do work that they may not have been able to do in their original job? And so those are some of the things that we're wrestling with. One of the things that I think is helpful to know is as we brought people back in for our first phase of our employees coming back into work, at this point, we've only had two people, I believe, that have needed to not come in yet. And so I'm hopeful that I know that right now there's a lot of unknowns and with the not knowing exactly start date and schedule and what school is going to look like, I know that there's a lot of angst for our employees around that. And I think that I'm hopeful that as we start to be able to give some more specifics, then we will be able to get some more specific information and work with everybody about whether or not they think they will be able to come back to work and in what capacity.\"},\n",

There will be an uptick with having that number of students coming back and also all the staff that are associated with them and all the various people that are in support roles at UVA. My sense from what I've been taking away from the Virginia Department of Education weekly meetings that we've had is right now the plan from the governor's office is to say, you know, at some point we're going to be in phase three and we don't have a phase four. It's phase three and then it's every man for yourself. And, um, so school systems are going to be trying to figure this out. Uh, the, the role of the, of, of the governor's office in closing all the school systems in Virginia, I, I don't know how this sounds, but it wasn't about schools. It was about flattening the infection curve so that hospitals had time to catch up on the cases during a scenario where the federal government was lacking in terms of providing testing and all the other things that we needed. So it was not about schools. It was about flattening the curve for Virginia. I think there's a lot of celebrating going on right now that the curve got flattened. And so it's like, OK, so now you're going back to school, make up your plan. Our plans are not going to be approved by the Virginia Department of Education. They're going to be read. And they're going to provide feedback to us if they feel like there's some aspect of the plan that we haven't covered. So it's going to be, you talk about challenges. There's certainly all the technical challenges and all the pieces. I think our staff has done an outstanding job of addressing. Then there's just going to be the part about the community in a situation, again, very similar to where we were in March, where there will be infections, there will be issues presented with that. How will we move forward? And I think our best bet is to continue to work very closely with the Thomas Jefferson Health District and work with them to do what's best for our students, our staff, and our families. So that's kind of my overarching look at it is that we're now We're now holding the ball. Every school system in Virginia, all 133 of us are going our ways, and we're going to try to figure it out. That's kind of how the VDOE works in terms of how they do things.\"},\n",

And then we will also consider additional PD next week, depending on how we have to adjust next week's schedule to talk about some of the other items that we discussed earlier in today's meeting. So thanks to everyone for flexing with us on this. I had to check that with Ross and Jono during the break. Ross, did I get that properly, please?\"},\n",

So I'll just ask for a volunteer who'd like to go first and I'll be looking at my clock here. Thank you, Judy. I saw your hand first, so I'll let you go. I'm always happy to.\"},\n",

And I, I understand this difference in our agenda today, but I do want to register my frustration that what was a two hour discussion was changed to two and a half minutes with just 10 minutes of notice. Um, and it really goes to a feeling that I have about our meetings in general, in which we are often surprised with detailed information, uh, that I personally would like more time to process, um, and give thoughtful feedback on, um, so, and I know that we will discuss our meetings in PD at some point, so I'll have comments then. Secondly, um, Where I am right now, I really urge us as a board to not look at our county as somehow immune to nationwide issues. I've gotten that feedback from a couple of folks and I recognize that we prioritize being an anti racist division and I applaud us for that. But we do still have the same stubborn outcome gaps as do other divisions. And as you saw also on the data that I sent last night, we still have the same types of issues with placing police where there are more lock and bound students. The daily progress has reported, um, that we have the same types of disproportionate minority contact and Elmore County as do other municipalities. So I really urge us not to disregard nationwide research as something that we think just doesn't apply to us. Um, thirdly, I really appreciate the speed with which the staff has been able to bring together. a review, but I again caution us on mistaking a lack of problems in a survey over the summer to meaning a lack of issues. And Mr. Oberg mentioned this before. So I'm also curious, because I did not catch this yesterday about how this stopped being an independent review. It still feels like we're looking from the inside. And that's always hard to judge. So that's what I got.\"}]},\n",

And then another one was added not too long ago to be another police officer at Albemarle High School because there are 2,000 students at Albemarle as opposed to 1,000 at Monticello and at Western. And also, they wanted to be able to have a police officer that could kind of circulate among the elementary schools and middle schools in the Northern feeder pattern without not having one at Albemarle while that person was out and about if they needed to be. I think that for the elementary schools, the most times when police might come to an elementary school is when there's like a heads up that there's going to be an upset parent that maybe has once a better custody arrangement and can't seem to get it. That's that's typically when I'll hear like you know that a police officer has an SRO has been deployed to go to one of the elementary schools is because a father or a mother or someone has said I'm coming to the school tomorrow and I'm going to take my child whether you stop try to stop me or not. That's typically like how that might come about. But to to the point that several board members have made, there's not a, in fact, I think one of the things that Dr. Acuff was arguing for was a greater accounting of the police presence at the schools because while they are assigned to be at the high schools, they're often not there because they're in training or because they have other uh, responsibilities that the police expect them to fulfill. Um, you know, they're not at the school every day. They're not, um, they're sometimes for a good part of the day because they've had to go to court or something like that. And I think one of the ways that, um, that you might rationalize that is because we, we pay for half of a police officer and the County pays for the other half. So, they're just not going to be there 100% of the time. So that was another thing I think that was sort of holding up our negotiations back and forth with the police department was we wanted greater accounting for the time that the police were in the schools. So anyway, that's just a little bit of perspective.\"},\n",

I somewhat resist abandoning the draft MOU, not because it should be, you know, implemented as is, but so that it could be a starting point Because there's a lot of good content in there.

So, as you know, and the community knows we've seen a pretty significant surge related to the delta variant, and just sort of going backwards a little bit. As we've mentioned in other forums. Delta arrived here in Virginia and specifically the health district right around the same time that the executive orders expired so we've lost any of the mandates that were in place regarding social distancing masking limits to the number of individuals who could attend social gatherings or events. And so that combination of the Delta variant and the opening up of our community and our society has really contributed both equally into where we stand at this point. We have seen a pretty significant surge, obviously with schools in place and children back on buses and in elementary, middle and high schools. we are expecting to see cases emerge. I think that the benefit to having gone through this for the last year, year and a half, is that schools across the district and specifically with Albemarle County have done a tremendous job to mitigate the risk to the extent possible. And I think important in that is that relying on the schools to do the contact tracing, once a case does emerge, and if that child has been in school whether infectious quickly identifying those individuals so that they can work on contact tracing. And that's one important change I think we want to highlight tonight. So in the past we've been contacting families whose children are identified as close contacts. And what we recognize is that we're duplicating a lot of the effort that's already been put in place by school nurses and administrators who have already reached out to families. And so what we're doing is we're going to continue to collect those line lists, rely on the contact that schools have made to those families, but we're not going to duplicate that effort anymore. And what this does is it allows us to focus on some of the community cases that we haven't gotten to in a timely fashion related to this particular search. And by doing so, we actually think we're going to minimize the number of children who may come to school because they would be put in quarantine prior to arrival. So it's just an example of how much confidence we have in the school's ability to identify close contacts and then provide that information in a timely manner. We continue to prepare for boosters. The FDA approved late last night boosters for certain groups. One which is kind of a broad category right now is 18 to 64 year olds who work in an institutional or occupational place that presents some sort of exposure risk. We don't have details on what that really means and we'll need to wait for Virginia Department of Health to approve all of that. And obviously we're keeping a very close eye on what the FDA may do with Pfizer for 5 to 11 year olds. This is really the next big step in providing another layer of mitigation for schools for children who want to come to school and really minimizing the risk again to another extent possible using that. No trends right now in terms of cases. We're seeing a little bit of a dip, but I don't want to say that we're on a downward trend with the current surge. So really critical that we continue to maintain all of the mitigation strategies that have been successfully implemented thus far. I'm happy to answer any questions you may have from the public health perspective.\"},\n",

So vaccine is really what's going to be the long-term solution to preventing illness, serious health outcomes like hospitalizations or death.

I know that just about everybody has still been going to see their schools during this period. And I hear about it when I'm in a school. And so it's very, very appreciated. And it really gives us a chance to see what's happening and how the kids are doing. And we all do have myriad stories about that. The second one is continued PD. And I think professional development is something that we're pleased where we are, but we can be better. And we can be better from learning more. And having conversations like these is a big part of it. But I think more PD, we had a great book study last year that was extremely worthwhile, in my opinion. And then the third one is, really working on developing the anti-racism policy and preparing our students for the most diverse population ever in the United States, that they will all be coming of age during that period. And I think preparing them through some of the things that we're doing and other things that will come through Dr. Hairston and his group and from members of the board, I think will be of great importance for all of us.

I mean, I really do want us to have a quicker feedback loop in terms of the progress, substantively what's being done, what needs to be done. Is there anything else the school board can do?

In the beginning, Zoom made it seem like it was actually easier because you got to kind of pop into things. But I would look forward to in the next year figuring out ways that we could have more engagement with people. Focus on the achievement was my biggest one. And I am basing that on the rubric. The rubric for the evaluation is how to have high performing success and student achievement for all students. And that's one that I think we scored in total fairly low, so just having it as a consistent point of our agenda items and meetings and a focus on the data and metrics and agenda. So at a majority of its meetings, the school board considers agenda items specifically related to advancing student achievement. I think we could work on that, which brings me to my third point, which is something I have heard feedback from various members. And it's something I think we've struggled with for a while is just agenda development and getting sessions and work sessions and items that were passionate about and that we want to hear about. And I know we're doing some work with that. I know Jono and Judy have been meeting to try to get through some work sessions, but we've done various things in the past where we've tried to brainstorm.

I don't know what we can do, exactly how we're going to keep it as a document on our desk when we're having our meetings. But I think we do need to do that. I think echoing Jono about interacting with the supervisors, like Jono, I keep in touch with a couple quite a bit, but we really don't get together much until the end of the year when, you know, we hear everything there is to know about HR and health insurance and capital improvements and budget and are terrified.

And teachers can drop in and talk to us one on one and make their concerns and I thought that was a good program we only got to do it at like three schools and then it stopped but it's like a way to show appreciation and one of the best ways to show appreciation is, you know, give an opportunity for them to actually speak to you about their concerns and not in a public forum which I'm sure a lot of teachers don't want to come and give public comment to make their their opinions and views heard, so I would love to see that re-implemented, and that would tie into my second thing, which is that more public engagement. I would love help on that, and just having things set up for what to do.

I think one of the governor's executive orders says that the athletes and students participating in athletics and things like that do not have to wear masks. So it's, you know, most of the school systems I understand when I'm meeting this morning are not wearing masks. There are some schools in northern Virginia some other places that are asking their kids to wear a mask to participate. Mr. Thomas what is our county policy or does it vary from one school to another with this. With the wearing of the mask? Yes.

But those that are buildings are not safe for them, who we would have in stage two, but they're safe enough for these activities where the respiration is higher. So to me, and for people looking for voluntarily going into the buildings, that's what stage two offers as well. So for me, it would make more sense to couple it with stage two. I'm not sure. We seem to go from three to one and I don't, I guess we're not really doing two anymore and I don't know if there are major logistical problems with that. For me, the voluntary part of it is not as compelling an argument because the surge, most of the post-holiday COVID surges have been from people doing voluntary activities.

And at the board's request, every meeting, we update you on one of those metrics, which is the current COVID-19 conditions in the Albemarle County region. and within Albemarle County schools.

       "    'content': \"Thank you. Good evening, everybody. You can see here that and you probably are aware that the numbers in Charlottesville, Albemarle, the surrounding area, the state and the country have all seen an increase recently. both in the case incidents and in the percent positivity. You can see from these numbers that there's been an increase, well all year really, we saw an increase surge after Thanksgiving, and then there was somewhat of a decline, and then the numbers have been rising again since the winter holidays. You see that Monday at 50.7, we were higher than we are on Friday, but the overall trend, I mean, Thursday, but the overall trend has been increasing. If we move to Charlottesville, you can see, oh, here's Albemarle's percent positivity has also been increasing. These are on the floating seven-day average, Charlottesville, their metrics are quite similar. They've been seeing an increase in this time. And then we had for the seven day floating average last week, we had a couple of really big days of reports, which is why Mondays was higher than Thursdays. But the overall numbers and trends have been increasing. The percent positivity for Charlottesville is a little bit lower here, as you can see. And Mr. Leike, who spoke earlier, who made the comments about UVA and the impact of their testing having impact on our percent positivity, which we are aware of, and we take that into advisement. And these are the CDC core indicators, ones we showed you before were the seven day floating average, but these numbers in red are the 14 day cumulative total. And that is what the CDC uses to assign these risk categories. You can see that our 14 day cumulative total has been increasing. And that's true throughout the state. You'll see that if you go on the Virginia Department of Health's website. And the percent positivity over the last 14 days, that's an average, has moved us into the higher risk categories here as identified by the CDC. That's for Albemarle. And then, Dr. McLaughlin, will you go over these mitigation strategies again? Yeah, absolutely.\"},\n",
       "   {'role': 'Speaker_48',\n",
       "    'content': \"Thanks, Eileen. So as you know, we set some thresholds for returning to stage one of instruction. And those were to be at the highest risk of transmission for the case incidence rate and the higher risk of transmission for the percent positivity and to be at both of those metrics for seven consecutive days. We have been there for five consecutive days at this time, but we're anticipating that they are not, neither one of those is going to come down below the threshold in the next two days. And because of that, we made the decision to move to stage one of our return to school program. A couple of other pieces of information that I wanted to make you aware of is our COVID dashboard has been enhanced even since the last time I spoke to some board members about that. Some of the feedback that we heard about the COVID dashboard, if you'll recall, the original dashboard just had a listing of the number of cases that had ever taken place in Albemarle and separated those out by students and employees and contractors. One of the things that we heard from members of the public and our school stakeholders was that it was hard to tell how long that data had been there. So we've added a couple of enhancements. The first is a chart that shows confirmed COVID cases over time. And so this looks week by week, beginning back on August 31st, at the number of cases we've seen in the division. And it separates those out by students, staff, and contractors. We also thought it was important to look at the number of cases as they occurred at each location, how many cases had individual schools and individual departments experience since the beginning of the year. So the second stacked bar shows that by location. We continue to have our full covert dashboard, and what we've added to that are the dates on which those those cases took place. So you can see here Monticello had one of our first reported cases on the dashboard that was a staff member. The week of August 31 Henley had a contractor the week of September 7 and on down the line. One of the things this does is it gives the public a little bit better idea of whether that case is still an active case, or how long it's been since the case has been there previously, we would have just seen that there was a case at Monticello or there was a case at Henley, and we did not have dates associated with them. And then finally, one last enhancement that we have is our current quarantine status. This just got added to the COVID outbreak or the COVID dashboard today. And this is going to be our running total of students and staff who are currently under quarantine due to positive positive coven tests and you can see that currently we have three staff members at Sutherland, who are in that category. So we, we feel like that's an enhancement all around for for what we're being trained how we're being transparent with the public. And we know that one of the things that's been on just about everybody's mind lately is the status of vaccine distribution in Albemarle County. And I want to thank Ryan McKay for being here again tonight. I know he was able to talk to the board briefly right when we came out of break, but I wanted to give him some time, Ryan, if there's anything else you'd like to share with the board about where we are with vaccination plans for K-12 employees in Albemarle, that would be great.\"},\n",
       "   {'role': 'Speaker_45',\n",
       "    'content': \"Yes, of course. So we for right now are in phase one and we'll be moving to phase one be officially within the next week. Announcements about that with more specific details will be provided tomorrow morning from our team. And so in one of our approaches that we're working on with the county schools, county government, And somewhat in partnership with unified command from the city and the county is an approach that would utilize and leverage resources from local government, the schools, and certainly from the health district to develop what we call points of dispensing for employees of the county and of the government and also for teachers. And the idea is that we would increase capacity by having school nurses get trained to vaccinate and approved for vaccination for our guidelines and then work with the county to recruit and identify those from the services who could also vaccinate. What this does for us is obviously provides one of the core groups within priority one B with access to vaccine. But I think more importantly for the community is that it relieves a lot of the stress from our current location and other locations that will be developed for access to the vaccine, providing more appointments for the community at large in phase 1B. So all of this would be happening concurrently and is an approach that we're working on with other schools throughout our district. The idea is that we want to move as quickly as we can, but also be efficient with the resources that we have available to us while also leveraging resources that exist throughout the county and across our district to try to move as quickly as possible and getting more access to the vaccine.\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"So thanks for that, Ryan. And just a couple of more points I wanted to bring to the board's attention before we open up for questions or comments. When we moved to stage one, we heard someone in public comment tonight talk about the impact on the PSAT test. And that is impacting our PSAT test. And one of the things that's been weighing on our minds is that PSAT testing is tied to eligibility for national merit scholarships. However, I spoke with someone at the National Merit Scholarship Corporation today, and they actually have an alternate means of becoming qualified for that. And that is open to all students, so long as they're able to take an SAT test prior to June 2021. So we've got our fingers crossed that we're going to see more SAT testing centers opening up in the future and that students will be able to take advantage of that. The second comment that came up was about fall graduate students who are planning on graduating at the end of this month, and needing SOL tests, and there are about 11 students who are impacted by that who are going to take an SOL test they need to graduate at the end of the month. And India Han, our division director of testing, immediately started looking for those kids from working with the principals and our testing coordinators. And I've been working with Dr. Haas on developing a plan to make sure those kids have an opportunity to do that, even if we're in stage one. So I think we've hopefully found ways to address both of those issues. And would be happy to open up for questions, comments about the COVID update.\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"Well, what I would say is that our posture has been to bring the kids in when we can. That's also been the guidance from the governor's office and the Virginia Department of Education. So certainly, as a parent of a child in the school system, the fluctuation from one time to another, I'm sure it can be disruptive. However, this week we were able to have our elementary school students who wanted to come into the schools be able to come into school. That's not the case for next week and the week after. However, that's the posture that we've had is that providing that choice for the families who want it to have their children in the school and the teachers who are going into the schools to be able to do that. It's each, you know, the direction from the Virginia part of education, which I agree with, is that we should take every inch we can get to bring children into schools who want to be there for their academic health, their mental health, their well-being, that I do not disagree, especially being a parent of a teenager, that this isolated time for many of our children, the small ones, the middle-aged students, the high school students, has had a traumatic impact on them. So I will abide, certainly, as the superintendent who takes direction from the board, with whatever decision you make, I personally think based on my understanding and the inconsistencies in the rollout of the vaccination, the real issues that are taking place with vaccinating that saying that we would not bring the children in and not give the families the choice to bring their children in if they want it. until we have all of our employees having both rounds of the vaccination, I personally, as a superintendent, would not make that recommendation. I would accept whatever direction I receive from the board. However, I think that that would be too long from now for the families that really want the choice to be able to bring their children in. Again, we're not forcing families to make that decision. We're putting it out there and saying it's available. And if you want to do it, you can do it. And I think that coming back off the holiday season, many of us are reeling from the staggering numbers that we see. And it's more of a commentary on our society's willingness to comply with mitigation strategies for the benefit of our children and the benefit of our community. However, it has impacted everybody's view on what we're capable of doing in the schools. And I don't know if Mr. McKay is still here.

So I still think, or otherwise I wouldn't have recommended it, that giving us the flexibility to come back to you as a board to look at the data, look at where we are, and not tying it to a nine weeks and not tying it to a specific vaccination date, is a better strategy because we really should be taking advantage of every opportunity we can to give the families that choose to have their children come into the schools to be allowed to do that.

That's also been the guidance from the governor's office and the Virginia Department of Education. So certainly, as a parent of a child in the school system, the fluctuation from one time to another, I'm sure it can be disruptive. However, this week we were able to have our elementary school students who wanted to come into the schools be able to come into school. That's not the case for next week and the week after. However, that's the posture that we've had is that providing that choice for the families who want it to have their children in the school and the teachers who are going into the schools to be able to do that. It's each, you know, the direction from the Virginia part of education, which I agree with, is that we should take every inch we can get to bring children into schools who want to be there for their academic health, their mental health, their well-being, that I do not disagree, especially being a parent of a teenager, that this isolated time for many of our children, the small ones, the middle-aged students, the high school students, has had a traumatic impact on them. So I will abide, certainly, as the superintendent who takes direction from the board, with whatever decision you make, I personally think based on my understanding and the inconsistencies in the rollout of the vaccination, the real issues that are taking place with vaccinating that saying that we would not bring the children in and not give the families the choice to bring their children in if they want it. until we have all of our employees having both rounds of the vaccination, I personally, as a superintendent, would not make that recommendation. I would accept whatever direction I receive from the board. However, I think that that would be too long from now for the families that really want the choice to be able to bring their children in. Again, we're not forcing families to make that decision. We're putting it out there and saying it's available. And if you want to do it, you can do it. And I think that coming back off the holiday season, many of us are reeling from the staggering numbers that we see. And it's more of a commentary on our society's willingness to comply with mitigation strategies for the benefit of our children and the benefit of our community.

You've seen some trials come out also with the Johnson & Johnson and Novavax vaccine, which the Johnson & Johnson is a single dose vaccine. There's a very specific reason that the Pfizer and the Moderna were put out as two-dose vaccines, and that was because initial studies suggested that they were probably about 75% to 80% effective after the first shot. And I remind you that we set the bar initially through the FDA at 50%. If we get 50% effective excuse me, 50% efficacy of a vaccine within any season, we're otherwise pleased, especially for a virus like this that spreads exponentially, that can have significant effects on its ability to protect somebody. The reason, though, that you did not see it stop at one shot and it go as a two-dose vaccine was purely because they found that the efficacy raised up to around 90% to 95% and 100% for preventing severe disease once you got that second dose. But that is why the FDA ended up approving it. And so while we obviously can't tell somebody, oh, you're fine, don't ever get the second, you're almost a whole way there. People should take solace in the fact that if they have one dose of the vaccine, that they've already begun the significant issue of developing immunity to it. And so I would encourage, and I've encouraged a lot of people, again, a lot of the teachers that asked me that very exact question last Friday when I was doing vaccines there, as I said, this is a big step.

With that being said, I know you guys have all seen also that the recommendation is still going to be that the vaccine is just one layer of mitigation and that even after people are fully vaccinated. We don't know we know that it is a good way to prevent people from beginning severe illness. we have no idea about its ability to prevent people from spreading the disease. And that's why you're not going to be seeing vaccination programs as part of mitigation strategies for large organizations because you're, you know, supplant things like mask wearing and physical distancing and all of the other information. And so I would say the vaccine as a general rule is that we excuse me, I apologize, the vaccine is a general rule for us, is a very personal decision of allowing, making sure that we can promise somebody is, or not promise, but get close to that, that somebody is not going to individually become sick. But I would encourage you not to think of the vaccine as a way to prevent spread within a school. We have absolutely no idea its ability to prevent that. And that's why all the data that I presented earlier is without vaccination, and I think needs to be kind of continued to be kept in that context. For an individual teacher, that's a different story. If we're concerned about individual at-risk people, the vaccine can make a noticeable, noticeable difference. But we do not know its ability to help prevent spread through schools.

I know that we're not dealing with unlimited resources and we have to make a lot of really difficult decisions to educate 14,000 students. So I really appreciate all the work that staff has done and definitely the people on the ground who are doing every day. So I really appreciate that. I just have a concern about the equity between the virtual learning and the hybrid learning. Also because we know nationally and locally that more of our black and brown families are choosing that. So I just want to make sure that we have some assurances. It will be important to me that we have some assurances that that is robust for my decision making. Firstly, I have a question about intervention services. And I think a way for me to be able to get my head around this is to know how many students will lose intervention services in stage four as it is now. And I know that you don't have those numbers ready, but that's something that I would like to know next week. Also, I would like to know how instructional hours for the hybrid learners will compare with the instructional hours of the virtual learners in K-3, or pre-K-3, I guess, for the four-day-a-week students. I assume that the 4-5, 4-12, I guess, would be the same. But I just would like to know the difference, if there is any difference between the instructional time for those youngest learners. And then I also would like to know how if or how meal services will be affected. For the students who are at home. And then on a different note, I don't know if this is something that Ross considers or we consider how this works. But I wonder if we should be looking at updated mask guidance, given that the new variant is likely coming or here. I know that we've all read a lot in the news about how the single cloth masks are just not as effective now against that. So that's just something I guess I'll throw out there.\"}]},\n",

But if BC calculus is only offered one time during the day, then the likelihood of that teacher of us being able to offer a virtual divorced from a hybrid is less likely. Now, having said that, we are talking about looking across the division to perhaps accommodate that. The principals have been working very closely with the teachers to try to work through this and figure this piece out.

And whereas the school board has responded to the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, providing students and staff members with the technology and resources necessary to ensure the efficient delivery of instruction virtually and in person. And whereas the school board has a substantial public interest in protecting the health and safety of its students, staff and community, and ensuring that the school division can provide staff and students with a safe and effective educational environment that supports student achievement. And whereas school division staff at all levels are essential to the day-to-day operations of the school division and are responsible for the thorough and efficient education of all students and their social and emotional well-being. And whereas a surge of COVID-19 cases has recently occurred, largely resulting from the Delta variant, also known as B.1.617.2, a highly transmissible virus that impacts individuals regardless of age, And whereas over 90% of COVID-19 infections are currently occurring in individuals who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19. And whereas the overwhelming scientific evidence has established that the vaccines authorized by the FDA for emergency use are safe and effective. and recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for all individuals except children under 12 years of age and certain others, and whereas the school board has the responsibility to prevent the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 infections in its schools and other facilities, and whereas the Director of Emergency Management for the County of Albemarle, Virginia has issued Order Number 21-3 pursuant to Virginia Code 44-146.21c, mandating vaccines, vaccinations, or periodic testing for COVID-19 for the employees of the County of Albemarle. Now, therefore, be it resolved that the school board finds that there exists a public health emergency that requires action to safeguard students and staff against the risks of infection, illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19. The school board adopts order number 21 dash three and will work in partnership with the county of Albemarle in the implementation of this order to control the spread of coven 19 in the school division and community. The administration of the school division is directed to develop procedures for the implementation of this resolution that are based upon order number 21-2 as modified to reflect the specific operations of the school division and school board policies, regulations, and code of conduct, and otherwise take all other actions necessary to carry out this mandate.

And I too wanted to thank the committee, Dr. Haas, the school board, Ms. Fernandez. This was quite an experience and our committee was extremely thorough and it was comprised of many different people and it was quite an honor to be a part of it. So I just wanted to walk through the process that our committee went through starting with The two surveys that we put out the first survey that we put out back in May yielded about 709 responses, which we were really pleased with considering we were in a pandemic and a lot of our students were still virtual so it was. It was a different task trying to get everyone involved and and on the same page. with understanding what they were being asked to do to fill out the survey. And then we also put out a second survey that we had a little bit more, so 719 respondents that we were also very pleased with. And the committee used this information as one part of the process in terms of being able to look at this feedback and information when we were able to discuss how we were moving forward. But I also wanted to note that in both surveys, a majority of respondents wanted to keep the school's name. But on separate questions, about 90% of respondents said the school should be named either for a physical location or a name that reflected a division value or for a theme. So again, this was one part of the feedback that committee took and used during our closed meetings. We also spent a lot of time talking to the public, whether it be within the school or out in the community. We held two community meetings, both with Spanish interpretation. The second meeting, we had several students write written testimony they were unable to attend, and those were read aloud during that meeting. We had several teachers, parents, and community members speak at the second meeting. We also compiled every email. Some emails were just feedback that they wanted the committee to read. Some emails were filled with research that the community members or students or parents or staff had done. All those emails were collected by the committee and used and read and processed with the committee during our closed meetings. And then we did individual research as a committee. Again, I spoke about research emails that community members sent us. We also reached out to the Jack DeWitt House in Kentucky. We had a member of our committee reach out to the Library of Congress. So we had a wide range of research that yielded similar information.\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"And then I would say the most important, the most fun part of this whole process was engaging students both virtually and within our school. We had several student leaders, both were avid, eighth grade avid students that stepped up. And one student suggested that we make a QR code specifically for the survey. That QR code was circulated around our school and then in the community. It was an easy way for staff, students, and community members to access the survey. using whatever technology that they had. It was also a lot of fun because it was an idea that was generated with by one of our student leaders. These pictures are the bottom, the bottom two pictures are displaying our community mandala project which is sort of how we kicked off introducing the name review process to the students. So we really asked them to think about who are we as a community and who are we trying to be. And a mandala is a visual representation of personal values. But in this case, we asked the students to think about their values as a community. And so we got 100 mandalas, although I'm sure there are more. We got a lot of virtual ones that we printed off and put up there, and then a lot came came from students within the building, but I know that there's more sitting in Schoology somewhere too, but this is sitting outside the library and it's a beautiful representation of who we are as a school community. A lot of what was really interesting is a lot of commonalities were seen visually and the committee was able to look at these and talk about what was important when developing and reviewing a name. And then you can see all of the students in these pictures are AVID students that helped with this project. The top picture is our eighth grade AVID mural project. Although that wasn't directly related to the name review, I wanted to include it because AVID is a huge part of our school community and their mural specifically this year really depicted and went well with the who are we trying to be and who are we now. And so that is their avid mural. It's the world with many different hands around it. And that's right in the front hallway. All right. So the committee and the superintendent recommend changing the school's name to journey middle school, based on the criteria below the committee felt very strongly that the name that was chosen needs to reflect the value seen in our school and the community. It was vital that it was representative of students, staff, and community voices. and then allowed all to be seen. And then most importantly, that a name provided, excuse me, provided safety and a welcoming environment for all that walked through the building. And then I just want to leave you with a quote from a student. And this was one of the written testimony quotes. In times like this, we must move forward and embrace change so that we can continue to grow. I feel strongly that we should change the name to Journey Middle School. I started my journey in middle school and I take a lot of what I've learned with me. So we welcome any questions or comments. Thank you.\"},\n",

Its mission was ambitious and vital to the collective prosperity of every community in the United States. The society was organized to promote academic excellence, provide scholarships, train leaders, and expand access to professional careers. A few years ago, the society broadened its charter to include high school chapters, and one of the first chapters in Central Virginia was established at Albemarle High School. Membership is open to students from all of our middle school and high schools, regardless of race or ethnicity. Students from Greer, Burley, and soon Walton are members and students are members, and students from UVA serve as mentors. There currently are 25 students in our local chapter, and more than 100 students have had their lives changed by this extraordinary program. Many have gone on to earn engineering degrees at the university level. The driving, guiding, determined light for these young people continues to be Ms. Pearl Early, Albemarle High School student support specialist. A characteristic of this program is its strong emphasis on project-based learning. Students learn how to research, design, experiment with, and refine solutions that can improve our lives. A natural topic this year is COVID-19, and true to form, students have come up with an ingenious approach to protecting public health. I understand that the nature of this development process is that it can take up to two years, but our students have field-tested their invention within seven months. I'd like to ask Ms. Early to tell us a little more about the journey of her students over these past seven years, and to introduce us to today's superstars who will tell us about their new discovery. Ms. Early?\"}]},\n",

       "    'content': \"Thank you. Good evening, everybody. This is Eileen Gomez. I'm serving as the COVID coordinator for this year. And you can see from this slide about Albemarle County on the seven-day floating average, our numbers have continued to go down. This has or a number of cases has declined for more than 14 days. So that is considered a decreasing trend. Next slide, please. And you can see that our percent positivity, that is of all those who are tested, what percent test positive, that has been declining as well. Although if you look at a graph over time, there's been a little bit of up and down. So this trend is considered fluctuating. The city of Charlottesville, You can see that it's been a, well, it's showing here that we have a decreasing trend, but you can see that it's a little, it's been fluctuating somewhat, but overall it's lower now than it had been last month. And the percent positivity for the city of Charlottesville is 1.8%. We've been low for about a month now. And that trend is considered fluctuating, but we're fluctuating in a very low zone there. Thanks, Eileen. Go ahead. I was just saying, there's a couple of ways to look at this data. One is the floating average, which were the other slides. The other is the cumulative total of the last 14 days. And that is what this slide is. I'll turn it back over to you, Patrick.\"},\n",
       "   {'role': 'Speaker_22',\n",
       "    'content': \"Yeah, thanks Eileen and this also in the CDC also looks at the percent positivity in a slightly different way to where they look at the, the average over the past 14 days, instead of the past seven as the VDH does. And you can see that. Based on our current numbers, our case incidence rate places us at the higher risk of transmission, and our percent positivity places us in the lowest risk of transmission. And as we've told the board before, it's important to note that there's a third factor that's been identified as the CDC to consider as schools reopen, and that's perhaps the most important one. And that's the ability of the school district to implement five key mitigation strategies, which include consistent and correct use of masks, social distancing to the largest extent possible, hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, cleaning and disinfection, and contact tracing and collaboration. with the local health department. And when schools implement all of these practices correctly and consistently, it lowers the overall risk of transmission in our schools, even when other factors are elevated. We currently have all five mitigation strategies in place and feel we're implementing them correctly and consistently. And we'll continue to monitor these numbers and our mitigation strategies now that we've moved into stage three of our return to school plan this week. With the move to stage three, we had over 2,700 students scheduled to attend in-person classes this week, although a few were sidetracked a bit today by the weather. In addition, we've got 140 buses on the road each day, bringing kids to school and delivering meals, which are being served to about 3,500 students every day. Stage three also brought the return of high school athletics and conditioning programs began this week with 75 to 150 students attending conditioning activities at each of our high schools each day this week, with the exception of today with the weather cancellation. And while Stage 3 has just begun, I wanted to let the board know about our work to plan for Stage 4 of returning to school. And first and foremost, we are making no assumptions that there will be either a recommendation or board approval to move to Stage 4 in the second semester. That will be driven again by the factors we shared at the beginning of this presentation. However, since there's a possibility that a move could occur as early as February, we are developing our Stage 4 plan. I'll share with you tonight a shift to our decision-making timeline, as well as how we're developing a more detailed plan for Stage 4. So based on stakeholder feedback, we're shifting the timeline for making a decision about which stage we'll be in as we enter our third marking period. On December 10th, we'll present to the board a detailed report from our stage four planning team describing the instructional and operational plans for that stage. On January 14th, Dr. Haas will make a recommendation to the board, and then we'll hold a special board meeting on January 21st for the board discussion and decision. Should the board decide that conditions allow for a move to stage four, we'll likely need to move the start date for that stage from February 1st to a date a week or two later in order to have adequate time to prepare. But a detailed timeline for that will be presented on December 10th. Some of the most consistent feedback that we heard from our community and from our staff when we moved to stage three was that our operational and instructional plans weren't quite detailed enough for families and staff members to make informed decisions about returning to school. Our stage four planning team is now up and running with four key teams. Our operational team is looking at key questions around school capacity, transportation capacity, food service needs and after school programs. The human resources team is reviewing their accommodation request process and timeline to adapt that for a potential move to stage four. And our policy team will be developing needed standard operating procedures. Our instruction team is developing detailed plans for both our secondary and elementary instructional models for the next stage. The instructional team is by far largest, with 10 lead coaches and 10 assistant principals paired together to lead conversations by subject area in the secondary level, and it will have a separate elementary instructional team as well. Teacher voice in the instructional plan is crucial for its success. And this week, we've invited secondary teachers to be a part of the planning process. So far, we have 65 teachers who have signed up to participate. Early next week, we'll invite elementary teachers to be a part of the process as well. And the work of these teams will be shared with the board and our community on December 10th, so that our stakeholders can make an informed decision about returning to school in stage four, whenever that decision in that time may be. And finally, I'd just like to reiterate what Dr. Haas mentioned just a moment ago, that our COVID-19 support hotline is up and running. As you can see, we've got both a phone number and an email address for our community to call us if they are in need, and we can connect them with resources, both in the school division and with our community partners. So that concludes tonight's update. I really appreciate the time to speak with you. And I'll be happy to take any questions or hear any comments that you may have.\"},\n",

Ms. Drago and Ms. Gairdner both mentioned and we've gotten a number of emails about the verbiage in our policy and also how it's being used. So I just, I wanted to put it to the board to talk a bit, to clarify a bit about what our intention is with that policy in terms of keeping our kids and staff safest. For me, the new guidelines from the CDC designating 15 minutes of contact over a 24-hour period that came out yesterday or the day before, was it yesterday? It just makes me concerned about this idea of respite, as well as the comments, you know, talking about expectations of teachers to set it specifically. And, you know, if that could be used against teachers, or if it's something that they would need to be managing on top of everything else as a part of hybrid learning.

And so their hospital levels remain low. And yet they come here and ours go high. If you look at, there was a period of time where we were at an elevated level, not because of the infections in our county, but because of the admissions in our county. So it made it look like our infection rate was higher than the surrounding counties, which was not true. But because of the way the CDC did it, they're assuming every county has a hospital, right? But it's impossible for a county that doesn't have a hospital, and there are a number of them in Virginia. to be impacted by that number. So it's only by the number of actual infections.

My understanding of the hospitalization rate is that the CDC looks at our health area as a whole. It comprises a number of counties, regardless of whether or not they have a hospital within that county. And they take the total number of cases that happen within that health district, hospitalizations that happen within that health district, and farm it out based on proportion of size of the county. So they do try to account for that a little bit. I don't know if it's a perfect system for that, but you can see counties without a hospital in them have an elevated level of hospitalizations as an intuitive as that seems.\"},\n",

So we were looking at administrators in particular. And we talked about the building up of administrators, nurturing them. And that was typically seen, like that was mostly seen as a good thing, but with a caution that when you look at the demographics of the administrators, how completely different they are from both the teachers and classified demographics. where mostly you're seeing like 72, 73% of teachers and classified staff, 77% are women, but only 53% of the administrators are women. So the question is, okay, so who is getting nurtured and brought up into the, to be administrators? The other question is the percentage of administrators who are internal and for the information that we have, it looks like about 72% of the administrative changes that happened in that year that was captured were internal. So promotions or transfers and then the other 1828%. Just doing quick math were external and so we're a school division that is really looking to make big changes in some of the you know, inequitable outcomes that we've seen. And I, I think that it can be hard sometimes to do that with so much of internal churn of the same sort of people. So that was just a concern that was brought up. We also had good discussions about substitutes and the support that we're providing with them. And it was encouraging to see that there a part of the big HR plan. So we're very happy to see that because they're a very important part of our ecosystem as we see more and more. And then we talked about how important it is to have the experience of teachers of color, but also we were interested in knowing more about the experiences of all employees of color Um, and especially since we, as an organization have a lot of like micro climates. So, um, you know, different schools might have different, I mean, certainly they do have different climates and different experiences for people of color.

I'm delighted to introduce tonight's spotlight on education because I'm the daughter of a public school science teacher who reached out to broaden his experiences in science and creatively engaged students. So spotlighting one of Albemarle County's own is a real treat. In 1994, the US Congress signed into law the Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Act, which provided a unique opportunity for highly accomplished K-12 teachers to serve in a national setting, one of which is a Smithsonian Institute. Teachers are given access to and will leave with a national network of leaders and programs to consult. Not only will this invigorate their professional development around STEM, but it will enhance their contributions to their school division when they return home. Yes. This highly prestigious national competition reached into Albemarle County this year for its newest recruit. She's Kate Cogey, who teaches science at our Charter Middle School. Kate will be working with the Smithsonian's famed Air and Space Museum, one of the most iconic, engaging, and heavily visited museums in our nation's capital. The timing is ideal for Kate, in addition to not having COVID to deal with, the museum is in the process of reimagining all 23 of its galleries and presentation spaces to, as the museum says, to inspire a new generation of pioneers and explorers. The work, Kate says, will fit perfectly into her next year's lessons in physics. It's a dream come true for a teacher who is passionate about break the mold learning. As exciting as the Einstein Fellowship is, it is not the first national selection process that tapped Kate's talents. A few years ago, she joined a cohort of influencers, which included a best-selling author, a movie star, I want to know who, an astronaut, and leading business executives and scientists in the NASA outreach program. As the only educator chosen, Kate visited Vanderbilt Air Force Base for the launch of an environmental satellite. She participated in briefings on the mission, pre-launch activities, news conferences, and was a VIP for the satellite launch itself. To capture her experiences for her students, Kate set up a YouTube channel. She returned to ACPS with an impressive lesson plan that ignited her students' interest to build their own launch pad and rockets. She also strengthened their engagement to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, where her students met, talked with, and learned about space flight from the laboratory's principal scientists. as Kate prepares to begin her Einstein fellowship. She's with us this evening to share her plans for what her goals will be and how the opening of these new frontiers of learning have and will continue to impact Kate and her students. So Kate, welcome tonight. And if you'd like to say a few words, I'm sure after that, all of my colleagues will have questions for you. But you have the floor.\"},\n",

It has been just a dream come true to work with community lab school these past three years. It has been such an engaging and inspiring environment. And I am so excited to share everything with the Smithsonian and bring back everything I learned in this next year to Agremont County. So thank you for everything, for creating this program for us. These past few years have been awesome. I'll be working, as you said, with the Air and Space Museum for the next year, working specifically on their Teacher Innovator Institute and What that program is, is it brings each year 30 STEM educators from across the country for free to the Air and Space Museum. They get to stay there for two weeks and work with each other and build these amazing projects that they get to take back home to their schools. And I would love to have a cohort of Admiral County educators out there too. It's an incredible program. I also would love to build projects with Averill County students, certainly with our school, but any school within the division. There are so many great resources there and I'm still learning quite a bit about them. This fellowship is quite, I'm learning something new every day, but yeah, thank you so much for this opportunity and for, yeah, for inviting me here today.

And there were three people who taught in our schools. One had previously taught in a Charlottesville school. There was the music director from Charlottesville High School and a teacher from Charlottesville Catholic School. If you're on YouTube at any point, look up K-12 Albemarle.

The question is going to be what are we actually capable of doing and implementing. And so that part, kind of the nuance of how we word our recommendation. Maybe I'm making an assumption. Maybe it's not just a given that smaller is better. So if the point of this is to kind of get how we feel, I would say for elementary school, I think small is good. But I don't know if that's reasonable. And if we have to decide where schools are going to be small or not small, I guess we should try to make them smaller where there's a higher concentration of economically disadvantaged students. But I don't know if that's really feasible or not. So it's a little hard to kind of get into the nuance because a lot of financial constraints.\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"All right, thank you, Ms. Jerome. In March, as you all were approving the funding requests, it was also approved by you to increase our classified salary increase to be higher than 2%. I plan to address this with you today. The exact motion is written out here for your reference. And I'll move right along. Before we jump into our recommendation though, I want to orient you to our starting point. The approved funding request on March 11th will be our baseline for the purposes of our discussion this evening. You approved a balanced funding request with $209.9 million in both revenues and expenditures. Here's a summary of our most recent revisions. The most significant impact that you see here is our state projections, which now reflects the most recently released state conference budget. We're seeing an increase in funding due to higher projections in sales tax, but more significantly due to funding for a 5% salary increase for SOQ funded positions over the current biennium. As a reminder, we had already planned for a 5% teacher salary increase before the state agreed to move in this direction. We've also made some technical adjustments on the expenditure side as we firmed up our minimum pay rate proposal and other approved items. In addition, you may remember that we had about $280,000 in unallocated expenditures back in March. This brings us to total available funding of approximately $1.7 million. Here are staff's recommendations on how the $1.7 million should be allocated. Per your motion, we recommend increasing the classified salary increase from 2% to 4%. I'll provide more details about this in just a moment. We also recommend increasing the teacher salary increase from 5% to 5.2%. While a 5% raise is in line with the market, the extra bump will further enable us to be more competitive with our teacher pay scale. Next, we propose restoring the STEP proposal from last year, which would expand our STEP program to four remaining schools. After this expansion, all comprehensive middle and high schools will have funding for STEP. We also propose restoring three positions, which were reduced during the last budget cycle due to the pandemic. We began this year's budget process with 15 reduced positions. We've since then restored 6.5 FTEs, and we now propose restoring three additional FTEs, resulting in a total restoration of 9.5. 5.5 positions will remain unfunded. Finally, we recommend putting the remainder of the expenditure change as transfers to special revenue funds to serve as contingency measures, as both next year and years beyond that remain somewhat uncertain. Here's some data regarding our classified market. We recently conducted a review of the adopted market and found that non-teaching staff in those divisions that responded are providing a median salary increase of 5%. The details of individual school divisions plans are listed here. We recommend a 4% salary increase for classified staff that's provided on top of adjustments as a result of the $15 minimum pay rate proposal. On average, classified staff will receive higher than 4% increases when combined with a minimum pay rate proposal. This slide digs a little bit deeper into the recommendation for classified staff. Here are some examples of positions who are and who are not impacted by the minimum pay rate proposal. For example, a typical part-time TA may earn $13.50 per hour currently.\"},\n",
       "   {'role': 'Speaker_1',\n",
       "    'content': 'But as a result of adjustments due to the minimum pay rate proposal, this example TA would get an adjustment to $15.99 per hour.'},\n",
       "   {'role': 'Speaker_10',\n",
       "    'content': \"The 4% pay increase would then be added on top of that to bring them to a new hourly wage of $16.63. The total increase for this TA from this year to next year would be 23%. You can see some other examples here as well that follow the same format. The proposal that we are recommending to bring back is the step proposal that we would like to restore that we discussed during last year's budget process. As I mentioned earlier, this proposal would expand the program to our remaining schools by adding 0.5 FTE to Sutherland and Henley Middle Schools and Albemarle and Western Albemarle Middle Schools. Finally, I do want to mention that we made some other technical adjustments. The first piece is with regards to the $4.1 million budgeted in our use of fund balance. While the total amount remains the same, we did make some slight shifts within these areas to reflect our most current and urgent needs. Similarly, we've made technical adjustments within the special revenue funds, primarily to account for changes in compensation assumptions, including the salary increase recommendations that we just discussed. Again, the total amount remains unchanged. Here are our next steps. After our discussion this evening, the Board of Supervisors is planned to adopt the county budget, which includes the transfer to ACPS. Our plan is to bring back an item to you on May 13th for action to approve the FY22 budget. The budget would then be appropriated in June in order to prepare us for the next fiscal year.\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"Yes, good evening board members. I'm Pat McLaughlin, chief of strategic planning for the school division. And I'm here tonight along with Rosalind Schmidt to give our COVID-19 status update for March 24th. So we always start our COVID updates by looking at our community levels in Albemarle County. And I am pleased to say that on March 17th of Friday of last week, we dropped down to a low level for the new CDC metrics. That means that we had fewer than 200 cases for our case incidence rate. We also had one of the other factors they look at is the COVID-19 admissions per 100,000 people in the population. Those were less than 10 for that week, and the percent of staffed inpatient beds occupied by COVID-19 patients was also less than 10. All of those factors put together give us a low level of community transmission. This is week one that we've been in a low level of community transmission, and I want you to remember that because it's going to be important for one of our final slides that we have. The other piece that we look at is community vaccination statistics. We've seen these several times. We have very high levels of vaccination, particularly among our school age students in Albemarle County. And then we also gauge our school impact, first looking at transmission within the schools. And this week, we've got that listed as a low level, although we did have one outbreak at an elementary school. Going to a medium level would take two outbreaks, but I wanna make sure the board was aware we did have an elementary school outbreak this past week. But our overall cases still remain low. On the COVID dashboard for last week, we had 23 student cases and two staff cases. Our attendance rate has really rebounded since it hit some low points earlier this year. Our attendance rate on Tuesday of this week was 94.2% in attendance. And we had an additional three-tenths of a percent of our population at home for quarantine or isolation. That equates to about 40 students that day. And finally, our staff absences. On Tuesday of this week, we had 65 staff absences, but only nine of those were COVID related. We always fluctuate a little bit between a normal and a strained posture for staff capacity because we know that substitute teachers are still rather hard to come by. And so I wanted to also remind you of a conversation we had last week about our planning for this spring and eventually moving to an endemic posture for COVID-19. We had four goals associated with that. One, to maintain a safe environment for our students and staff. Two, to align with current public health guidance to the greatest extent practical. Three, to ensure that changes are transparent, well-communicated, and easy to understand. and four, to transition to an endemic state with sustainable infection control practices. And there's really four key points on this plan. The first happened this month, and these are already in place, that masks became optional for our students, and we've also reduced our quarantine and isolation time, both for students and for our staff. Next month, we plan to suspend contact tracing for individual cases, and we're also gonna make some modifications to our return to school criteria after a student is symptomatic. We are not going to make changes to our identified mitigation strategies. We feel those will continue to be of benefit to us. And then there are two areas where the board would need to take action before any changes could be made. And if you recall from last week, Those two actions are any action on our staff and visitor mask requirements and any changes to our staff vaccination or weekly test requirements. At last week's meeting, you charged us with getting some recommendations from the School Health Advisory Board on both of those policies and so that you could make an informed decision around those.

       "    'content': \"Thank you, Dr. McLaughlin. I'm Roslyn Schmidt, Chief Operating Officer. As Dr. McLaughlin mentioned, we sought a recommendation for the board's direction from the School Health Advisory Board. I'm grateful for that board for reconvening on short notice. So they met earlier this week. and made the following recommendations. So first regarding masks, it was their recommendation that the mask requirement for staff and visitors should relate to community levels and trends over time. This aligns with the current CDC guidance, which ties mask recommendation to community levels. So more specifically, what that means is their recommendation is to eliminate emergency policy EBA, which is the mask and acceptable face covering policy. when community levels reach low for at least two consecutive weeks. So as Dr. McLaughlin mentioned in his data, we hit that low level last Friday. We anticipate it this week as well, but to be determined. They also discussed the importance of being able to respond if there's another surge or other future circumstances. So again, the more specific recommendation is to replace, if you're going to eliminate the emergency policy, replace it with an amendment to an existing policy that more operationalizes mask requirements and other public health guidance in the future. And so that would allow us to be a little more agile and flexible with CDC guidance. So regarding staff vaccination, their recommendation is to eliminate the weekly testing program or vaccination requirement for staff at the next practical date. but they are in strong encouragement of vaccination. So they urge the school division to continue to develop ways to encourage and incentivize vaccination. Happy to answer any questions on those recommendations. But before I do that, we just have one more slide and then we'll open it up. So with those recommendations in mind, if the board accepts those recommendations, we wanted to outline some practical steps the board could take. So, as I mentioned, the SHAB recommendation mentions two weeks at the low level, which will likely meet tomorrow. But you'll see these steps more aligned with spring break. You'll see an April 4th deadline. We feel it's a more natural time to make a change if a change is desired and allows more time for communication. And I'm confident the School Health Advisory would agree. So first, you'll see the first step to take would be to end the emergency policy. By doing so, that means masks will continue to be required until spring break and will become optional for staff and visitors beginning April 4th. So that's the first step. The second step would be that you could direct staff to amend our recommendation is policy GBE, which is a staff health policy. There's some opportunities there to add some language around giving the superintendent and staff authority to implement health initiatives specific to the CDC, VDH and Blue Ridge Health District. Those details are not specifically mentioned in the policy now. Again, that allows ACPS to remain agile in response to updated or future guidance. and if community levels change. If that's the step the board wants to take, we would present a draft at the April 14th business meeting. And then the last step relates to the vaccination weekly test requirement. You could end that requirement effective April 4th. That means that the last required weekly test for those employees would be next week. And then again, we align that with spring break. But if a sooner date is desired, we would feel like March 28, Monday, is the soonest. We wouldn't recommend any immediate changes. So with that, we'll open up for any questions or discussion.\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"I'm Vernon Lectee. I'm a teacher at Elmorrow High School, and I currently vote in the Jack Jewett District. I'm here to talk about collective bargaining. As public school teachers, my colleagues and I have been humbled by the support we receive from the parents, the board, and the public during the coronavirus pandemic. We've all seen posts on social media from folks who say things like, we should pay teachers a million dollars, or I didn't realize that their jobs are so hard. While we appreciate the sentiment, most teachers will tell you that they don't need a million dollars. What we need is the dignity of a voice on the job. For those that are not aware, collective bargaining is simply a process of negotiation between employers and their employees. Police, firefighters, and teachers have concerns related to workload, compensation, staffing levels, and safety. We want to make sure that classrooms are not overcrowded and that emergency responders have the resources they need because our work conditions affect the vast majority of Virginians. Collective bargaining allows localities to partner up with their employees, so they better understand these concerns and work together to address them. Fortunately, the General Assembly of Virginia has passed legislation that could grant Albemarle employees collective bargaining rights. The legislation empowers the localities and the school boards to give us those collective bargaining rights. This law will go into effect in May of 2021, and is now up to the school board to give the employees these rights. There is no inherent cost to collective bargaining. Giving teachers the power to negotiate a contract does not mean the school boards or localities are forced to spend money that they don't have. Rather, collective bargaining is about working within the realm of what is possible to achieve the best possible result for everyone. Workers who are on the ground are often in the best position to identify inefficiencies and waste that they witnessed firsthand. Furthermore, teachers' working conditions are the students' learning conditions. We want smaller class sizes so that we can give your children more attention. We want adequate planning time so that our students can get high quality lessons. And we want a consistent discipline policy so that consequences are fair across the board and not influenced by influential racial bias. Our contracts typically run in the ranges of two pages. The wording is intentionally vague and teachers feel pressure to take on extra responsibilities without additional time or additional compensation. We need clarity and we need protection. So many people in the past few weeks have expressed their respect for our teachers, firefighters, and public sector workers who continue to deliver essential services through this pandemic. But you can't support teachers if you don't support giving us the freedom to join a union and bargain collectively, as our counterparts in the private sector can do. Our students deserve the best. This school division is stepping up to ensure our students have the support they need to finish the semester. We're not turning back on these kids in the middle of a pandemic, and we're asking that our elected leaders not turn their backs on us. I encourage the Albemarle County School Board and the Albemarle County Board of Supervisors to grant its employees the right to collectively bargain. Listen to firefighters, police, and teachers. Show us that you truly do respect our professional opinions and give us a seat at the table. Thank you.\"},\n",

Dear Angel, on the occasion of your concluding your service to our school division as our student representative to the Albemarle County School Board, I want to express the appreciation of every member of our board for the quality of your counsel. I'd also like to quote from what you told us at a meeting on February the 25th and talking about school boards. You said you provide the conduit that delivers the community's values and will into its schools. It's not an exaggeration to say that decisions they make often have a greater long-term impact on our communities than those of any other elected body at any other level of government. You brought these words to life when you helped to lead a community town hall examining the life-threatening risk of COVID-19, most especially the equal medical care and services provided to communities of color. The expert panel you brought together included state and local officials and a large online audience. Your role in that event and your leadership on the Student Equity Advisory Council ensured that you have indeed had a great impact on our communities. Your discussion of structural racism, from the point of view of a student now widely shared across the division as part of our anti racism orientation for all employees did indeed deliver a community value into our schools. Your willingness to offer insightful perspectives on such highly consequential decisions on the safest and most effective learning environments for students and staff proves the wisdom of student representation on our board. Repeatedly, you have contributed to the establishment of a direct link between ACPS students and the elected body that governs them, and for that we are all grateful. There is no lack of definition for what makes a good leader. One of my favorites is that a good leader is thoughtful, inclusive, dependable, generous to others, and eager to provide them with opportunities to shine. It's exactly how you were described to us and how you will be described to the next organization fortunate to benefit from your service. Thank you for making us better. Best wishes for a successful year at Albemarle. And to you and your family, please continue to stay safe. Respectively, Graham Page, Chair. Angel, we appreciate so much what you've done for us.\"},\n",

I've seen him around town involved in various projects.

You'll remember that when we had conversations last year about trying to get to a 4% pay raise for teachers, that was part of our strategy because, you know, I've kind of changed my mantra here. over the past couple of years from saying that we have a competitive market to we just have a competitor. And our competitor is Charlottesville. And they pay teachers a higher pay rate to start and the pay stays higher all the way through. And so if I'm a minority applicant or any other applicant for that matter, and I'm looking to get a good start in life, and I don't need to change very much as far as the location that I'm heading toward, I'm going to go to the district sitting right next to Albemarle. if I can to start out at a higher pay rate. So that was one of my biggest disappointments among dozens in our budget process last year was we didn't get, I felt like knowing where the city was going last year with their pay raise, that if we were gonna hit 4%, we would have finally flattened out with them at the start and at least be able to attract more teachers, particularly more minority teachers into our applicant pool. One of the things I appreciate about this year's hiring was even though the pool shrank for minority teachers, the hiring of minority teachers went deeper into the pool. The minority applicants made up 11% of the pool. They made up 16% of the hires. So they dug deeper into there. And what that tells me is that the principals of the schools are beginning to realize, and many of them are beginning to realize because they've experienced at least the beginning of or the full micro-credentialing process and or the certification process around culturally responsive teaching to understand how impactful it is for students to see themselves in their educators. And they're hungry to hire minority applicants and applicants with more diverse experiences. You use the word rural. I often use the word rural to describe Albemarle as a rural school system that is trying to be more metropolitan and move in the right direction. But there are still some rural vestiges that we're continuing to fight against, which include hiring people I know, hiring people whose people I know. And we are making headway with those things. But really, I want to put that compensation piece that you mentioned right back out in the forefront again, because we had a couple of dollar sign strategies that I thought were going to help us get ahead a little bit. Because we do need to make more than these just holding serve or incremental changes if we're going to have an impact, especially as minority teachers come and go. Even AATF candidates are not required or aren't expected through their MOU with AATF to stay beyond a certain tenure depending on the amount of financial assistance they receive from AATF. So we have much more work to do. I'm so proud of the work that's going on, especially when I hear about these intense individual efforts. We just got to get a bigger pool.

The first celebration already had taken place, fittingly enough, at an educational institution, which was Kent State University, six years prior. Today, the influence of Black History Month enriches the curricula of schools, colleges, and universities throughout our nation, and it should lift the consciousness of all. Its theme this year is Black Family Representation, Identity, and Diversity, exploring in part the strength of Black families across the United States. We don't have to look very far to find a deep personal appreciation and insight why its theme for 2021 so resonates and is so vital to our own school community. In fact, we need look no further than Monticello High School. That's where Autumn King is a sophomore. For many years, Autumn was intrigued by an old family photo in her grandmother's house. It was of a young lady born in the latter half of the 19th century. Autumn often studied the picture, which was of a great, great, great grandmother. a photo that immediately dominated her attention every time she entered the room where it was displayed. Autumn is an outstanding young woman who finds inspiration and guidance from the story of others in life and in art, just as she does every time she becomes reacquainted with that photo and its compelling image. On the eve of Black History Month this year, with its focus on the strength of the Black family, Autumn's grandmother bestowed her with a very special gift. The photo, which has been passed down in the family for more than a century, now has been given to Autumn with the simple explanation, because I know its care will be in good hands. Autumn has written about her great, great, great grandmother, not as a class assignment, but in response to an ancestor who has reached across several generations to speak to her. I'd like to ask Autumn to share her poem with us this evening. And Autumn, we are so glad that you're here with us.\"}]},\n",

One nit-nit question goes back to what was to be funded with EDEP, and I understand that that is not happening. The one question I have, though, is that they were paying about $85,000 or $87,000 to the division every year, and that had been taken back or given back under the 21 budget. Is that still the case or will they continue to submit payments from their revenues? The way this scenario is built is that what they've done in FY20 would continue.\"},\n",

I stand by the vote from last week. I know Mr. Page at one point you had an interest in the in doing a parent survey. I don't know if you're still interested in doing that as part of the As part of the program moving forward, I know the school division is ready to move forward when we give them solid direction. And I would agree that July the 9th is going to be too soon. And I regret that I'm probably not going to be part of that next conversation. I got a lot out of the student responses. And I saw that there were. It was primarily the high schools that responded, which you would expect, with 64%. There were some groups that were overrepresented, the Asian population, the white population, and the Native American population. The representative one was African American population, the underrepresented one or ones were, well, was the Hispanic population. Two that weren't broken out were disabilities and ESOL. And as I was going back and forth and reading that information, I realized that it would make more sense for me to just look at the disagree and the agree sections, as opposed to the neutral sections, because no matter which way you were looking at it, if you move the neutral over with the disagree or neutral over with the agree, it totally skewed it because there were a lot who were neutral in that. I thought that was very interesting. I fully agree with Ms. Lee's statement from last week of we have to look at the national information, not just the local. And I, but I also have to say that I think we have to look at the local and not just the national. So I think it's got to be a blend. And I think that's what we're trying to do. I had a conversation with a senior police official on Wednesday, and she, he told me that the biggest concern that they had, if we're not, and I understand our motion is not to have a full-time presence. And I think we're all in favor. And please correct me if I'm wrong on this. you know, that there would be situations in which the SROs could be on campus, whether it's being called or whether it's teaching, you know, being involved with, you know, as was described in the letters from the principals and from the students, that they, you know, sometimes teach. I know that's not the major part of their duty. But the biggest concern was that if we are only going to have them on a call basis, you know, pick up the phone when we needed a police presence and we call 911, that means that we get the next person in the rotation in that area from the police. And that that person who will be responding to us may or may not have ever worked in a school environment. And I think there was one example given in the principal's notes about when a, I think they called it a road cop, never heard that expression, that showed up and it wasn't as good an experience as when SROs who had relationships with students, who had relationships with the principals were the ones who were dealing with situations. So the one thing that I would like to have us consider and perhaps have schools consider is to maintain some kind of a relationship And I'm not saying full-time on campus, I'm not doing that at all, but with the SROs so that it's a known quantity when we need help. I don't know how to do this, but it's a known entity that comes onto the campus in the northern feeder pattern, the southern feeder pattern, the western feeder pattern. And they've had experience working in schools. They've had experience working with principals. And I'm not suggesting that the road cop would not be somebody who's trained. I'm not suggesting that they wouldn't be trained in how to handle an emergency. But I think that our environments in our schools are different. than many of the things that these folks would be used to seeing every day. And I think it would be to our benefit to somehow figure it out so that at least some, if not all of the SROs are the ones who would respond when they're needed.\"}]},\n",

One is through our local clinics and we're we're hoping to be able to one of our Albemarle County clinics. We've done our first one. We're hoping to be able to do a second one. We've been working with the Blue Ridge Health District, and that is all dependent on the available vaccine. They also are vaccinating people at the Kmart tent through the Blue Ridge Health District, and they're working on some other partnerships. And so, unfortunately, we don't have hard numbers on that.

So if a primary care provider, a pharmacy or even one of our hospitals wants to order a vaccine, it has to come from that 2850 allotment, which has to cover our entire district. So right now there is scarce availability for the vaccine and we need to spread that vaccine in a way that's most equitable to our entire community and so it makes it difficult to sort of carve out large chunks of numbers for individuals who receive the vaccine. Based on our current schedule, those that have an appointment to get vaccinated are all in February at this point. We are trying to expand to the extent possible, and when we do, we'll make options available for K-12 educators, including those in Elmoral County, to access either by providing enough vaccine where they can operate that site again at Charlottesville High School in tandem with Charlottesville City Schools, and the Regional Emergency Operations Center at our Kmart location or in hopefully the near future at the Big Lots location that is operated by UVA Health.

One of the things that is difficult with all of this is all of the information needs to be reported by the employee to let us know what's going on. Right now, our principals and our department supervisors are working to collect that data. That's what you saw tonight, a partial collection of that. We've asked our employees, number 1, if they plan to have the vaccine. Then we also ask them a couple of questions about whether or not they've had it. Have they had their first or second dose? Do they have an appointment already scheduled and are they unable to schedule an appointment? at this time. And then we ask our principals and our supervisors to identify what the work is that those people are doing now. Our first prioritization as we went through the clinic at Charlottesville High School a couple of weekends back was we wanted to make sure that we were first inviting those that were in person with students during stage three. And what we're doing now with the information we have We'll continue that prioritization to get all of those people in stage three in person vaccinated first, or the opportunity to vaccinate first, and also roll in the stage four people as well. And that way, we are making sure that we're focusing first on those people that are directly working with our students. It crosses all of our schools and departments. So we are looking for that from our, our bus from our bus drivers to our teachers to our teaching assistants, our school based administrators, and so you know we're hopeful that we will make sure that those who are I'm going to back up. We know that there is a great need and a great desire for vaccine from all of our staff members or many of our staff members, but we are trying to work to make sure that those who will have the most interaction with students have that opportunity early on.\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"I'm Vernon Lectee. I'm a teacher at Elmorrow High School, and I currently vote in the Jack Jewett District. I'm here to talk about collective bargaining. As public school teachers, my colleagues and I have been humbled by the support we receive from the parents, the board, and the public during the coronavirus pandemic. We've all seen posts on social media from folks who say things like, we should pay teachers a million dollars, or I didn't realize that their jobs are so hard. While we appreciate the sentiment, most teachers will tell you that they don't need a million dollars. What we need is the dignity of a voice on the job. For those that are not aware, collective bargaining is simply a process of negotiation between employers and their employees. Police, firefighters, and teachers have concerns related to workload, compensation, staffing levels, and safety. We want to make sure that classrooms are not overcrowded and that emergency responders have the resources they need because our work conditions affect the vast majority of Virginians. Collective bargaining allows localities to partner up with their employees, so they better understand these concerns and work together to address them. Fortunately, the General Assembly of Virginia has passed legislation that could grant Albemarle employees collective bargaining rights. The legislation empowers the localities and the school boards to give us those collective bargaining rights. This law will go into effect in May of 2021, and is now up to the school board to give the employees these rights. There is no inherent cost to collective bargaining. Giving teachers the power to negotiate a contract does not mean the school boards or localities are forced to spend money that they don't have. Rather, collective bargaining is about working within the realm of what is possible to achieve the best possible result for everyone. Workers who are on the ground are often in the best position to identify inefficiencies and waste that they witnessed firsthand. Furthermore, teachers' working conditions are the students' learning conditions. We want smaller class sizes so that we can give your children more attention. We want adequate planning time so that our students can get high quality lessons. And we want a consistent discipline policy so that consequences are fair across the board and not influenced by influential racial bias. Our contracts typically run in the ranges of two pages. The wording is intentionally vague and teachers feel pressure to take on extra responsibilities without additional time or additional compensation. We need clarity and we need protection. So many people in the past few weeks have expressed their respect for our teachers, firefighters, and public sector workers who continue to deliver essential services through this pandemic. But you can't support teachers if you don't support giving us the freedom to join a union and bargain collectively, as our counterparts in the private sector can do. Our students deserve the best. This school division is stepping up to ensure our students have the support they need to finish the semester. We're not turning back on these kids in the middle of a pandemic, and we're asking that our elected leaders not turn their backs on us. I encourage the Albemarle County School Board and the Albemarle County Board of Supervisors to grant its employees the right to collectively bargain. Listen to firefighters, police, and teachers. Show us that you truly do respect our professional opinions and give us a seat at the table. Thank you.\"},\n",

But then as we went in, we talked about the exit surveys and, you know, saw a pretty decent size number in terms of dissatisfaction with policies and practices. And a lot of what we talked about with Mr. Redding was the whys and how this is getting measured and what kind of listening is going on.

And I think the number one word that we kept coming back to was communication. and communication with our staff to find out what was good for them, what was not so good for them, what we had for them, how we could help them.

How would we do this without following something similar to the middle school folks? Not having this be punitive as far as discipline and what would be the yin and the yang of when you could use it, when you couldn't use it.

I'd like to talk today and ask a little bit about the decision-making process on whether or not to open schools and how to do that.

       "    'content': \"Yeah, I'd also like to ask that the decision to open the schools is made on a local basis. We're not Northern Virginia, we're not Richmond, it's a different situation. I know we've been closed for two months now. It will be three months by the end of the year. I think everyone can agree it's been an awful experience for all of us. Kids have missed education. The online schooling has been good, but it's not the same thing. I'm also much more worried about the mental health impact. I know that my kids are beginning to be depressed. And if we don't open in the fall, we'll be doing an experiment on what happens if you don't let kids socialize for nine months. That's never been done before. And these are the ages where they have learn and the brains have to rewire and socialize with the peers and do it that way. So if we don't reopen, then I'm afraid that will be a very, very bad situation. And I mentioned data before. I know that it wasn't necessarily a popular thing to close all the schools for the whole year at the beginning when there wasn't much data. And it was probably the wise decision. But I'm a PhD scientist, and I've looked at some of the data out there. And there's a couple of pieces of evidence. One is that Out of the 75, 80,000 deaths in COVID so far, there's only four kids in the five to 14 age range that have died, which implies that if we open schools, it would not be a danger to the kids. And also there's a risk of the kids coming home and affecting the parents, which is a real risk. But we also have an experiment going on in Sweden where they did not close the schools and their deaths and infections were only about a third higher than us. Yet in Stockholm, they have 30% immunity and they expect by the end of the summer, they'll have herd immunity. So they, they traded off something there. Um, so I, I just like to ask that we use data and stuff like that. And unfortunately, as we know, you know, if school boards can decide we'd like to open, um, they can be overridden by the governor. I would like to ask that school board considers ways to get ahead of that and maybe communicate with the governor and request that it would be a local decision. for the benefit of the local parents and kids. And also maybe talk to some other school boards. If you could have 10 school boards that all feel the same way, let us make the decision not have a blanket one size fits all decision and maybe do like a newspaper editorial about that. That might be a good way to let this be a local decision. And so that we could all have some kind of agency because I know that, you know, some parents will leave the state if the schools don't open and they can't work. I mean, that's how I feel. If there's six months of no school, and we can't work, it's untenable, we'll be sending the kids to go stay with grandma or something like that. It's not a good situation. But thanks for the opportunity to talk to you guys, and I hope you guys come to the right decision about opening the schools in the fall.\"},\n",

I haven't done this in a while. And I think that debate and dialogue with the school board is not allowed, and we'll take it from there. We have 11, I beg your pardon, we have 10 speakers tonight.

       "    'content': \"Page Nod, if you can hear me. Okay, great. I'm sorry, I'm having some technological difficulties. My apologies, I don't have a camera, which I very much dislike, but I just wanted to let everybody know on the board that we're very appreciative. Thank Dr. Acuff for her very nice words. It's very appreciated. I just wanted to mention that one of the tools that we have in our toolbox this year that we really didn't have until really late last year is the vaccination. I know everyone who has not had one is concerned about the safety and the fact that it came so fast. But this vaccine has been a miracle, really. It was developed in under a year. It was developed with very good science. And I don't know of any vaccine that's ever had so many doses given in such a short time. I would say over 200 million doses right here in the United States. and thus far it's proved to be rather safe. And I just wanna underscore to the families out there who've been a little reluctant that they should go ahead and get their vaccine. It's really important. The pandemic has become a pandemic of the unvaccinated. If you look at the hospital numbers, it's clear that 98 to 99% of those being admitted to the hospital are unvaccinated. The same is true of those who are dying. And just in the last two weeks or less, the number of patients admitted to the UVA hospital has doubled. And I don't see an end to that. I think it's gonna get worse before it gets better. And the way to prevent that is for as many people as possibly can get their vaccine. Of course, not everyone can get a vaccination. The current vaccine is authorized for use in kids 12 and up The one that we use in that age group is the Pfizer vaccine, which is a two-dose vaccine. It's given three weeks apart. It's available pretty much anywhere that you want to get it, including numerous doctor's offices, the health department, numerous mobile clinics. They'll even come out to your home and do it at your home if you have an inability to get around. And that can be arranged through the health department. So there's really, I think we've tried to remove as many obstacles as possible to getting the vaccine. Everyone is curious about when the children under 12 will get vaccinated. We are as well. We're fortunate at our office that we're participating in the study for the Pfizer vaccine in that age group. We have a little bit of an insight on that. And unfortunately, Unlike what you've seen in the press here lately, we do not expect to see authorization of the vaccine in the kids under 12 until December. The FDA has requested a four to six month period of data collection. And we can tell you that the kids who were enrolled in the study in that age group did not complete their series until early to mid July and thus, if you count four to six months from there, that takes you into early winter. I'd like to think it would come faster and sooner, and maybe something will happen to allow that. But realistically, I think we're looking at early winter before we're vaccinating the kids under 11. And so I think, as I said earlier, this is one more tool in the toolbox. The way to prevent spread in the schools is to continue using all the tools in the toolbox. And that includes all the mitigation strategies that Dr. Perriello has mentioned already, plus using the vaccination where we can. I'll return it back to you all.\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"All right good evening members of the board as Jackson just introduced me my name is Josh Roller. I know you guys have had a long meeting already and still some more to go so I'll keep it as brief as possible. The audit and all related issues have already been discussed with the full audit committee back in November in great detail. So if there are any additional questions that come up, feel free to interrupt me or ask me at the end. But from that, we'll kind of get into it pretty quickly here. And I'll go by the page numbers at the bottom of the page, not the PDF page numbers to hopefully avoid some confusion. Starting on page one of the audit report, This is our auditors opinion where we have issued an unmodified opinion, which means we believe the financial statements are fairly stated on a material basis for the year, 2020, flipping forward a few pages on to page 23. Pages 23 and 24, these are your Exhibit 1, Exhibit 2, your entity-wide statements. These are your financial statements on a full accrual basis. They include all your long-term assets, all your long-term liabilities, in addition to your regular fund accounting, which are further on into the report we'll get to. The bulk of the report is in the footnotes of the financial statements. I'll point your attention to two pages in there that might be of interest to you. On page 60 is the capital asset note related to the school board. Just from comparing last year's ending balance to this year's ending balance of capital assets, the total capital assets net of accumulated depreciation increased from 67.1 million up to 71 million. The next one on page 66, this is your long-term obligation note of the school board. Again, this also increased, this increased from around 194 million up to 214 million. The large majority of this increase has to do with the net pension liability and net OPEB liabilities that are all based off of actuarials that kind of come up with these reports and these numbers that are based highly on estimates. Probably the most useful couple pages of the entire report there start on page 150. This is your school operating fund your food service fund and your school capital projects fund on the, on the budgetary basis. Exhibit 41 there is your balance sheet for the year for those three major funds. Exhibit 43, two pages later, is your current year activity of those funds. And then exhibit 45 is the same information as exhibit 43. It's your current year and for current year activity of all those funds, but it also just includes budgetary numbers for comparison. And then the last couple things here on page 177 this is our auditors report in accordance with governmental auditing standards. This is where we're saying we had no matters that need to be disclosed related to internal controls over financial reporting. The next two pages later 179 this is our auditors report. over uniform guidance compliance. Uniform guidance is what kind of governs the federal compliance part of the audit.

It shows all the for the county and the school board, all of the federal expenditures for the year. At the bottom of 183, it breaks out just the school board portion of that.

When we are revamping the budget, have we ever considered doing like a zero-based budgeting model for departments since we're kind of in a time of constriction with our budget? And I know Steve had mentioned that maybe 10 or 15 years ago, we went through and did that with departments.

So Mr. Zimmerman.\"},\n",
       "   {'role': 'Speaker_27',\n",
       "    'content': \"Thank you, Ms. Schmidt. This is Jackson Zimmerman. I'm the school finance officer Uh, going to present to you today, um, some, uh, information regarding what has happened to date from the beginning of the pandemic until the current point that we're in. Um, Maya, could you put forward this? So if you remember this pandemic began in March and it affected all of last fiscal year. We did have some COVID related expenditures, but relatively small. We had some savings associated with reduced operations, but again, relatively small. If you remember, we made a real effort to keep all of our staff whole during this process. And since more than 85% of our dollars are tied up in staff, that was not affected. Things like fuel and other things of that nature did results in some improved performance and operational savings. We did see some lower general school revenues. Things like building rental, athletic fees, donations, those kinds of things were less in this past fiscal year than they have been previously. One bright section of last fiscal year is that state revenues were higher than we had anticipated in June. If you remember, we did a third quarter financial report in June and did some preliminary projections in terms of what we believe state revenues could be like. Primarily driven around sales tax was a significant concern during this time frame. State revenues were higher than we had originally reported in June. Um, so that is some very, very good news. Um, the other really good news, um, is that our local transfer that local government had communicated to us was going to be cut in the prior fiscal year. Does not in, uh, does not appear to be, uh, cut at all in this, in prior, in the prior fiscal year. So that significant reduction in local revenue did not take place. We, so because of this, we do anticipate a significant, not a significant, we do anticipate having fund balance available, increasing our fund balance that's available from this current fiscal year. We are still managing this current fiscal year. Our auditors do not come until October. So we've got basically nearly a full month's worth of work still to do on the prior fiscal year. but wanted to give you a preview of what this looks like. So one of the takeaways of this is the prior fiscal year ending June 30th looks like we are going to have some increased fund balance, and it's going to give us some flexibility in operating for fiscal year 21, which we're in currently. So in fiscal year 21, we have had some very significant expenditures for COVID-related, either directly or indirectly, kinds of expenses. The range is well over a million, certainly in approaching the $2 million range in terms of expenditures for PPE equipment. If you remember, we distributed a large number of iPads. We have distributed a very large number of hotspots. So those kinds of expenditures, along with PPE and some cleaning equipment and supplies, they really did add up during this time period. Some of these are going to be offset by CARES Act monies, but not all of them. CARES Act is not sufficient to cover all of these expenses. So that's one thing that we're keeping an eye on for the current fiscal year. Operational expenditures, we're operating in a huge unknown here. We have never operated a school division where we're bringing in some kids for the year, most kids running virtually, Um, we were running school buses, but not as many as we'd had previously. So the, the concern is that we're, we're still in terms of operational expenditures in a, in a relatively unknown. As we develop some more, uh, experience in this area, we'll get a better handle on our operational expenditures. Could be some savings, could be some, some, uh, increased expenditures, a lot of question marks during this time period. The next few weeks will provide us with more information. In terms of revenues, we did have, so we're going to experience some generally lowered school revenues. We are also going to be experiencing some losses in terms of our revenue generating programs. EDEP in particular, the expenditures in that program will be exceeding EDEP revenues. So we will just need to monitor this as time moves forward. State funding. Again, that that sales tax significant issue associated with last year carries over into the current year. We believe that the same sales tax forecast, um, is is higher than what we had originally began our budget for for fiscal year 21. So that's some good news. Some bad news. The enrollment. Our enrollment's down. Our enrollment is down a lot. So a large component of state revenue is driven by your overall enrollment numbers. We had budgeted for a higher level of enrollment than we currently have. How this enrollment number rolls out over this time period is going to drive our state revenues. Because we have lower enrollment, our average daily membership, which is what our revenue is based upon, is anticipated to be significantly lower. The one thing I wanted to point out, much discussion has been taking place at the legislative level about an enrollment hold harmless. That legislation did not get reported out of committee. That was very disappointing as many divisions across the state are experiencing this enrollment loss. And I know that a number of state organizations are planning on bringing this forward and we're planning on bringing it forward as far as our legislative packet, but really wanted to make sure that that we keep that hold harmless legislation in the forefront of our mind when we have discussions with the legislators. So sort of summarizing where we are at the end of the first quarter. We have a number of areas where we're keeping an eye on. Some revenue areas are better, some are worse. But the big advantage that we have now is we have some fund balance. And so it gives us a level of flexibility to run through this current cycle that is very, very good for us. It gives us many more options than we had, than we were anticipating at the end of June. And I'm turning this over to Ms. Kumazawa.\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"Thanks, Jackson. So to shift gears a little bit, we have begun planning our budget development process for our FY22 budget. This is a draft timeline of what we are proposing. And I'll mention what's a little bit different this year than previous years and what's coming up So the next work session on the 24th will focus around the CIP and long-range planning. And we will give you an update about the CIP and have a discussion around our priorities for how we bring projects back if that is even an option. And then after that, the school board members will come together with the board of supervisors to further have the discussion about CIP, but then also the other joint efforts of discussing where we are with our compensation based on our, we will compare where we are with our world at work and our other market to see where we are in order to determine any strategies for the future. And then on November 12th is really the time where we will get together to discuss the annual budget. That is when the state of the division will be presented to you, and that will be a time to provide budget input. And after then is when we will be receiving state and local revenue projections. So as you can see, the fall and the winter work sessions are a little bit more streamlined than previous years. We don't have as many. And that has been planned with the local government and making sure we are aligned there. And then you can see, typically we have the funding request in January, but we're proposing that we move that back about a month to February so that we can fully incorporate the most recent revenue estimates. And we're not, you know, as uncertain of a place as we might be in January. We just want to work with the full information that we have. And I think that the longer we wait, we can work with better data. So we're proposing pushing the funding requests back to February and having those work sessions run through the end of February, maybe into March, but still adopt the budget in April. Local government is is proposing a similar calendar where everything will be pushed back just a little bit more to give staff more time to incorporate in more relevant revenue updates. And then I also quickly wanted to pull up our annual budget goals that we have in our budget document every year. So while we still don't know what our revenues projections are going to be next year, we do have goals that we try to strive for. The first and foremost being to meet our mission. So I'll give you a moment just to read through those. And I just ask for this evening for your agreement with these goals as we go into the budget planning process. And there will be more time to provide input as you saw in November and January. And I also, the next slide is a slide to encourage you to think about what your preliminary budget input is for next year. And again, this is extremely early in the process. We really don't have any indication of what our revenues are gonna look like. We don't know what our full expenditure needs will be. But I will open it up just for a few minutes for you all to provide preliminary high level areas where you think should be focus points for the FY22 budget. But before we do that, are there any questions about our current state of finances or with the budget process for next year.\"},\n",

We saw a significant decrease in over identification. that was quite inspiring, quite honestly, and a lot of great gains. We still continue to, and all of the schools are on board with progress monitoring, we have management systems for our support system, and we're close. When I've been reviewing the last two years, particularly three years, we're talking singular students, whereas before it felt quite honestly, like overwhelming, right? Like 30 children in a group, how do you, you can't just go and find them not eligible, right? You can't kick kids out of special ed. So, but now we're getting to like singletons and it is incremental because that's the challenge is you can't just go out there and go, you know, you child, I have to knock you off the rolls because you're, you're of a minority, it doesn't work that way. It goes into practices, and we've been addressing that head on through other means, not just RTO. As early as the first semester this year, we've been working on methodology, especially with speech and language pathologists, because one of the group were children of Hispanic groups being found eligible for speech and language impairments. So we were looking at our practices of identification for speech and language impairments and brought someone in from John. Oh, I don't want to say because I just went blank in my brain. The teacher university down in New York City brought her up to do training on dynamic assessment. And the same with school psychologists, looking at best practices with identification and working with teams. So we are looking at spreading out that issue, working with particular schools as well. So yeah, it's not all eggs in one basket, as much as trying to diversify where our efforts are. But it's coming close. It really is in Singleton type children. We get our reports each year from the Department of Ed. So I'm really hopeful that pretty soon we can, it's not a have to, that we actually choose to do intervention specialists and tiered systems of approach in the school.\"},\n",

The one thing that I would say about the video was that I sat through a couple of student conferences at Greer a couple of years ago. And it was just, they were fabulous. And there were three, and in two of them, the parents were crying. You know, they were so emotional about how their child, who could speak English in one case where they couldn't, was talking to them so well, and they were just overcome. We were talking in terms of the overall, we liked how the structure was laid out in terms of the what for the program. We appreciated the SEL component and thought that was so important, especially right now. In terms of wants, we had a few of these, and I don't think we got through all of them, but the difference between the relationship between SEL and mental and physical wellness. We want to get that expanded on. When will the, what you were talking about, Jen, be ready to go and in terms of will the assessment start before the end of the school year? Will they start after the end of the school year? When will they be, how long will it take to get it analyzed?

And I have no idea on that one either. Down in the opportunities, I made the comment about I think that CRT training will be absolutely invaluable for this because it can go across every group throughout our schools. And I think every family and every student will benefit from that. And June made a great point in terms of we've got to seize on the creative solutions more than just brick and mortar.

       "    'content': \"Good afternoon, board members. I'm Pat McLaughlin, chief of strategic planning. And before I dive into the calendar, I just want to respond once more to Ms. Lee's request I just heard from Jennifer Butler and COVID-19 results will be posted on our survey results page this afternoon. So I'll send those to you as well, but any members of the public can access those then. So onto the calendar. As part of our return to school plan, Albemarle County Public Schools solicited feedback from the community about changing the start date of school to be later in the year. As you can see here, our response rate was very robust. Usually when we do a calendar survey, we're lucky to get about 11 or 1,200 respondents. We had close to 5,000 this time. Most of those were parents and staff members and students, but also had about 95 community members. And that's in the space of less than a week. We opened up the survey on June the 11th and just closed it yesterday. And so I'll share the results of that survey with you tonight. I want to just take a minute, too, to thank Mr. Page for encouraging us last week to look for ways to engage stakeholders without Internet access in the survey. With a very quick turnaround time, the technology and communications teams enacted a phone survey feature in Blackboard Connect that we hadn't used before. This allowed us to send a phone survey in both English and Spanish to 568 homes without internet access. 101 of those families opted to participate. And I think this is just a wonderful example of a practice that helps to close the opportunity gap for families in the school division. So onto the results. A majority of respondents believe that the later start date would be beneficial to students. That was the first question that we asked them. You can see that 51.8% responded with either a four or a five in terms of the benefits of a later start date. Close to 30% of respondents believed a change would not be beneficial to students. And this had a weighted score of 3.36 out of five, which indicates to us the general consensus is to shift the start date to a later date in the school calendar. Next, we asked folks to what degree they were satisfied with each of our two drafts. For the start date of September 2nd, respondents were asked to rate their level of satisfaction. This one had a weighted score below three, indicating that respondents would not be satisfied with this draft calendar. The plurality of the responses was a neutral response, indicating they were neither satisfied or dissatisfied, which could show a little bit of ambivalence toward this particular version of the calendar. The second calendar option with a September 8th start date was rated more favorably with a weighted score of 3.45 indicating general satisfaction. The plurality of responses selected very satisfied with this draft and about 28.5% of responses selected a level of dissatisfaction with this draft of the calendar. We had about 250 pages of comments to go through. And so with the survey ending yesterday, we have not been able to disaggregate those in a way that would be meaningful to the board yet. But as soon as we have that, we can pass that information along to you. And so we just wanted to talk about next steps. That our hope, as you saw in Ms. Collins' presentation earlier, is that we can have a board vote on the calendar at the June 26th as part two of the board retreat. And really there you've got three options to stick with the original calendar, to move to the September 2nd start date in the calendar or to move to the September 8th start date in the calendar. And so that's our hope that on the 26th, we can finalize that and have one more item checked off the list as we begin to implement our return to school plan. So those are the results of the survey. They will be, I believe they are already published on our survey results page as well for the public to see. And I'll be happy to take any questions that you have.\"},\n",

On another, you see 15 days there.

So it could be. that we go back to 195 actual present days for our teachers.

And we see that in our local climate surveys too. However, Feelings of safety vary by race in the United States. And one study found that 77% of white students report feeling safer in the presence of school security guards, while only 54% of black students feel that way. EAB goes on to say that arguments against SROs state that they may excessively criminalize student behavior. And the research does confirm this argument. So in those In those files, and especially in the EAB research report, they give you a few alternatives to SROs in schools, and they give examples of school divisions that have taken measures to have SROs leave their schools. So you can read through those examples. And at this time, I will turn it over to our attorney, Ross Holden.'},\n",

       "    'content': \"Thank you. Good morning, board members. Thank you for your time. I prepared a resolution, not so much for you today to look at it and decide whether this is how you want to address the situation, but rather to provide some structure for your discussions today. We understand your position about the most recent MOU program. and want to let you know that we certainly will consider and make our best recommendations for a different program for school security. So there's no magic to this. It's not meant to say this is what we want as a school division. but rather to give you some food for thought. The most important thing, though, for us, for the superintendent and the cabinet, is that we have some direction to pursue. We've had an SRO program for decades. We don't have an off-the-shelf substitute program. That's gonna require some research, some discussion, before we can bring back to you recommendations or at least options for you to consider hopefully in the near future. But we do need some time to do that. And this is what this resolution is meant to do, to have the board provide guidance to the superintendent on what we should be looking into. Some of the ideas we had, for instance, are the use to which the draft MOU that has not been even completed yet with the county, but which addresses many of the issues about which you could express concern. And that is making sure that law enforcement does not intrude on the rights and authority of the school division to handle its own disciplinary matters. The draft MOU also states the goals that Ms. Gelmer was kind enough to put on the screen, and that is to make sure that all children feel safe and secure so that they can thrive in the school system. But that said, we don't have any preconceived notions. These were some ideas that we thought we would put before you for your consideration, for your change, for your modification. But at the end of your discussions, what we're asking for is a resolution that will guide our actions going forward to make sure that we are able to come back to you with ideas, with options, with recommendations for your consideration to have some type of school security in the ACPS. I will tell you, one thing that you need to know when you have these discussions is that The state of Virginia, by law, does not require SRO programs. However, if a school division decides that it does want an SRO program, it must follow the model that's put out by DCJS. Now, I wish I could have given you that today as part of your package, and we'll get that to you as soon as possible. However, the website has had technical difficulties for over a week, has announced that they've had technical difficulties for over a week and that we are unable to access that. However, to give you a good idea of what it looks like, the draft MOU which you have in your possession does follow that. It goes beyond the MOU. It covers everything that the DCGS model has But it goes further to delineate the responsibilities clearly between the school division and the police department so that law enforcement and school disciplinary matters are clearly separated. And also to provide some additional, I don't know if responsibilities is the right word, but that the SROs in the schools would have different roles to play, not just to bring students into the law enforcement arena. In fact, one of the major goals of the draft MOU is to, as much as possible, keep students out of the law enforcement chain and allow the school to resolve its behavioral issues on its own without intervention of law enforcement. But as I said, those are all ideas for your consideration. And what we would just really appreciate is some very concrete direction from you so that we can go forward and provide you with the information that we hope will allow you to develop a new program for security in our schools.\"},\n",

This last year, it doesn't feel good. But getting into really comparing ourselves to ourselves is where the rubber hits the road. And there are some things, I mean, I'm looking at the life after school numbers that I think were 3.84, 4.2, and four out of five. That's 76%, 80, 84, 80, 80%. So it's like a mid C, two low Bs, and a mid B. And so they're obviously, if you just do it on a percentage basis based on five. And so, you know, I really am looking forward to seeing what that's going to become over the next couple of years, because that's one that we can compete against ourselves. But I will tell you that the equity dashboard, and for anybody listening in who's never really paid attention to it, is one of the great tools that the school division has developed where none of us can run, none of us can hide.

Let me say first on the public comment, before every school board meeting, actually the day before, and then the day of, we post on the website, the homepage, the public comment option, and then we also post it on social media. But I think John's suggestion to add it into his email communication that goes to all families is a great idea, and we'll do that as well. Regarding the survey, as many of you know, the plan was to post a community opinion survey last week on the five budget priorities that were discussed at the school board meeting last Thursday. And the survey was posted late Friday. Now, we do lots of surveys, particularly on budget topics. And we generally get between 1,000 and 1,500 responses and consider that to be a pretty good response. Last week on Saturday and Sunday, which are not ideal days usually for public comment, we got 2,000 responses to the budget survey. So we exceeded what normally takes us a week or two weeks to get to. We got to that on Sunday. We're now at over 3,300 responses to the survey, which is just a phenomenal feedback from the public. We have several categories in which people can identify themselves in responding to the survey. The largest category of respondents or participants have been parents, about 40% of our responses have come from parents, 26% have come from students, and then 25% from employees and 8% from community members. We've seen some strong responses in the last couple of days, particularly from students weighing in on the various priorities. I think Maya is going to reference the survey in her presentation a little bit later this evening. But in general, the overwhelming, in terms of levels of support, the overwhelming choice of the people who are responding to the survey is you're strongly supporting student learning as a budget priority. And a little bit behind that, not far behind that, doing what we can to keep current employees employed and protecting their positions. And also ranking high was equity, which is, I think it's the highest support we've seen for equity in these public opinion surveys in a number of years.

And that's not something that I think Often it's something people say, well, gee, I want to go to school in the summer. I certainly wouldn't have wanted to. Opportunities, the most obvious one is that we have the potential for in-person instruction, additional reading time, focusing on math and reading. One of the strengths, the opportunities that I think we have is, I think that as a matter of, eventuality, our country is going to have to go to year-round schools. The reality is we're the only country in the world that still has summer break like we have. We know that there is an academic slide every single year. And so this is an opportunity to show our kids, to show our parents, to show our staff that, look, this could be a really good thing that maybe helps us to transition. One of the concerns that we have is that all of our kids have suffered through the pandemic. All of them have suffered setbacks academically. We know they have. But it's not necessarily going to be reflected in their academic performance. And so I hope that we don't lose side of the fact that all of our kids are going to be needing assistance, even if it doesn't reflect that on their grades or their test scores.

       "    'content': \"Good evening and thank you Chairman Page for the introduction. Mr Jeremiah, thank you for the opportunity to speak about Unforgettable Jackson Peak Early High School. Dr Haas and Dr Dunn. were very kind in allowing me to visit the county office building and go through old school board meeting minutes, which really assisted me with my research. I began volunteering with the Burley Varsity Club in 2011, and I became very intrigued with Burley High School. And I kept hinting, this great history needs to be documented. It did not happen. So I took the challenge and I decided to write the book because it has been more than 70 plus years since the school opened in 1951 and there has not been a publication or an official history written about the school. And many of the students No, all of the students are now senior citizens, and many of them are no longer with us. And the book tells some of the history of the school. There's just so much that you could write about. And there's the three area high schools. There's a highlight of those, Jefferson High School in the city and Albemarle Training School and Esmond High School in the county that united to become Jackson v. Burleigh High School. There are wonderful interviews from students, faculty, and administrators. And what was so important to me is that there is a picture of every faculty member, all of the administration that was there from 1951 through desegregation and the closing of the school in 1967. There is a timeline of the building of the school as well as an architectural description of the school. And there's many pictures of the organizations and the sports teams. Imagine for the first time, two jurisdictions, the city of Charlottesville and Albemarle County working together to build, own and shortly operate a school. My project began in 2020, right at the height of the pandemic. So it was really hard to get into UVA Special Collections Library, Library of Virginia, the Historical Society. So it took 18 months from the beginning of my research until the publication of the book. But I did have the opportunity to interview via telephone students and faculty, which was wonderful and what I'm stressing is that it is so important when writing history. to pull in segments of oral recollections. That was what really wowed me. That's so important. And working with the Burleigh Varsity Club, we could only locate about 17 of the remaining Falcuti. It's not that many more that remains anyway, but I was able to interview 13 of them and get some wonderful interviews. And I guess one of the most amazing things about that I learned about the community is that doing a very tumultuous time the parents fought so hard for their children to have a better education, so they partnered with the city and the county and for the first time working together. they began to erase that unequal educational system that was there at the time, and slowly it proved to be very fruitful. And through my research, some of the most important things that I learned, they were absolutely amazing, is that the land owned by Mr. Burley was acquired by eminent domain. The African American students from green county attended burley high school because they did not have access to a high school in their county. There were some students there from nelson county and I learned that African American students would only get an education through the 11th grade until burley open. in 1951 and I think one of the most amazing things and I just really delighted about that is I had the opportunity to reach out to Mr burley's granddaughter. Dr Olivia box and she and I have continued to keep in touch she lives in Atlanta now and that has been wonderful. with her talking about her family, but what I would like to stress is now is the time to document preserve and never forget the past. As we begin to secure the future by writing our histories and being an advocate and making sure that others are doing the same. The city of Charlottesville and Albemarle County are just rich in history and they have done an amazing job of preservation, and I think that is wonderful. So thank you for allowing me the opportunity to write about one of your schools. That's a great preservation. And your dedication to public education is absolutely outstanding because it is shaping the lives of our children and preparing them for a brighter future. And one of my last thoughts because Your Chairman Page had already mentioned about the Burley being on the Virginia Historic Landmark and being on the National Register of Historic Places. And that monument, that marker will be unveiled in April of this year on the grounds of the campus. And my last thought is placing copies of the book in all of the schools libraries will enhance discussions for students to talk about the schools of yesteryear. And what's so wonderful is that school is now Burleigh Middle School and it, you know, gets a lot of attention. It's been a wonderful school and you've taken really good care of it. You have wonderful students there and I love the administration over there. So thank you for allowing me to talk about my book tonight. And I hope that there's continued conversations and maybe at some point, some of these various students in the book that gave interviews can go over to some of the schools and the young people can ask questions about the days of yesteryear. Thank you so much for allowing me to discuss this. So I'll take any questions.\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"Typically they're staffed with one special educator and between two and four instructional assistants based on the grade level of the student and where that model sits and the need of the classroom. We kept those models at about eight students, students with autism. The next group is, or the next model is our B-BASE program, and that is, and BASE stands for Building Appropriate Supports with Evidence. And the B is for behavior. So children that are struggling with behavioral regulation, getting their needs met in a way that respects those around them and the learning that's taking place, when they struggle with that, we have this model set up. And all of these, the A-BASE, B-BASE, and C-BASE are available across the school division at each of the grade levels outside of preschool. So B-BASE is staffed with a special educator and typically one to two instructional assistants, again, based on the grade level of where that program sits. Then we have C-BASE, which is an inverse. The A-BASE and B-BASE models are by default inclusive models, the kids are expected to be out in the general and classrooms with supports by the staff see base, on the other hand, is providing it starts in see base with core instruction in aligned standards of learning for kids with. significant cognitive impairments, with the focus on providing as many inclusive opportunities, supported inclusive opportunities as possible for students in the general education environment. So I want to highlight that. Previously, in the past, we had referred to CBASE by many different names, right, functional skills classrooms, community-based instruction, But they are we're generalizing to see base and the C stands for curriculum, the staff in this model is bridging the need of students to access the curriculum in the general education environment. Then, what sits on top of all of these models are our multi school specialists. These include. The incredible support services of our speech pathologists, occupational physical therapists, school psychologists, teachers of students with vision impairments and hearing impairments, our autism and behavior specialists, And adapted PE, and I hope I didn't miss anyone because they are critical. What we've learned is the infrastructure, they provide the infrastructure, the glue and the support for these programs, and to work for both the staff and the students, really to align ourselves with the vision and mission of Albemarle County Schools. This next slide really highlights very similarly, but again it just breaks out the different staffing models for a clearer picture of that's where the investment in staffing is going in the FT ease that we are continuing to invest in our base models and. Initially, we moved in this direction really for three reasons. One was for the student. We needed to do more and do better for our students with disabilities. And two, for families. Families weren't happy with the jack of all trades model to special education. And since then, there's general support, I would say, and you'll hear that in a few weeks from our Special Ed Advisory Committee in particular, that support this move toward specialized models. But the third, and I wanted to at least put out some data here, was to address what the state has called really runaway they use the word runaway but an over reliance on outside service providers for kids with disabilities that pose challenging needs to public schools. So on this next slide. It shows the number of students that we in Albemarle County Public Schools have sought services from private day schools. That's the light green. Private day schools are those like the Virginia Institute of Autism, Elk Hill School, Keys Academy, Lafayette School to name a few. Those are located in the community for students that we could not serve appropriately in our public schools. And in the dark green below is a public separate school, that's Ivy Creek School, right behind Jewett and Greer. And that is a school for students with significant emotional disabilities that require intensive supports. And you'll see generally over the years, even since 14, 15, this has been relatively stable. Now, the placements within each, you know, fluctuate, but generally stable, which is opposed to the next slide, which is some data from the state level that has been trending upwards. Surrounding divisions, the state is still trying to grapple with what they consider out of control referrals to private day and public institutions for students with disabilities that pose challenges to public schools. So I just wanted to highlight that at least that point, and I do think you'll hear from our special ed advisory committee that supports our base models and where we're going, but also our we are educating our kids in our public schools through these models in a way that bucks the trend across the state. My next slide that I'd like to present is really a follow-up to some data I presented at least, I think it was last year, where we had data to suggest the pandemic really took impacted the number of students with disabilities that are preschool aged, as indicated by our enrollment, a significant dip in 2021. And we do believe it was based right on fear and the unknown of the pandemic. But the good news is that things are coming back, right? We've just reported in our December 1st count, 129 preschool children with disabilities that we're serving. When I checked on Monday, that number was 170 just since December 1st. So there is an active referral and eligibility process and service delivery models, I predict after all the transitions are done, and based on our data that we have, that we're probably gonna be, again, back on track with similar trends and trend data in previous years with students in preschool. These students were not included in the earlier enrollment slide, but I do believe that they will probably hit around 160 students with disabilities at preschool level, which is good news for us. We want to provide those services. And that, as I said earlier, is part of the special ed staffing request. So in summary, Special education staffing, the request is for a little under or over $739,000 and just under nine FTEs, which would go to staff our neighborhood schools and these specialty models and the multi-school support staff that really hold them all together. And on the right, the special education services funding is for what's called the Children's Services Act. And that is for, as I mentioned earlier, private day schools and residential programs for students with disabilities. It is a fund that matches the funding that comes from the state for those two purposes. And why I'm asking, that's the bulk of the request there, is there are general costs. you that are increasing and somewhat significant, right, for salary and benefits of just those programs to run. But also on the horizon are very few students in very costly placements that I need to plan for. And they're going to happen, they haven't yet, but I do see an impact financially that warrants the request for these special education services. And part of that 330,000 is also an increase to our Piedmont Regional Education Program that we still utilize for ancillary services like assistive technology and we're adding on some time for mobility and orientation services for students with vision impairments. We had a very difficult time contracting for that very specific service, but it's very limited amount of time. And we believe PrEP can help us out in that regard, as well as Ivy Creek School. We are still maintaining 29 seats there for students with serious and significant emotional disabilities. And that is the state and request of special ed. Any questions?\"},\n",

Tonight, I will share with you the directions of our discussions and the considerations we are looking to plan for summer and back to school in the fall. I want to set context before we begin to look at specific options. The next two slides I've shared with you before, so you will probably recognize them. As you remember, the Virginia Department of Education developed guidance on the continuity of learning. The guidance given under the first option has been instrumental as we move through our current digital learning endeavors. We have determined which students have access and which students do not. Our teachers and schools are providing paper resources or thumb drives with resources for all students who do not have access, which is about 5% of our students. Next. At this point, we've moved from reviewing content shortly after the school closure to teaching new content until the end of the school year. As we begin to consider the guidance given us under number two and three, we must decide how we will ground our next decisions. How will, what will we base those decisions on? Will we treat all learners K through 12 the same? As we move to considerations for the future, I want to make sure that I preface this discussion with no student will recover from this disruption by just thinking about the immediate future. We are planning to make up for lost instructional time and create plans for closing learning gaps. we've begun to think about what will drive our decisions for the next 18 months. We must first consider what we know about learning. For most students, their learning looks like this graph, a slow, steady growth rate over the year. As summer comes into play, we think about what is called the summer slide. Summer slide affects younger learners more than our older learners. To visually represent this, Northwest Evaluation Association published these graphs a couple of weeks ago. I think they represent for us what we're trying to think about as we move into a recovery phase. They also give us some background to which learners we might target as we move forward and why we would target them. Let's go back to the math slide, please. I'm going to walk you through this graph and then give you some time to look at it. Let's look at the top line eighth graders. If you fall inside line you will see the slow steady learning curve for most eighth graders. And this is averages. You can see how the line moves to the last day of school and then how it slides back somewhat from the last day of school to the first day of the school of the school the following year. That's what we call the summer slide. Now Let's take a look at the next, I'm sorry, go back to math. Let's take a look at the dashed line, and that's what they're calling the COVID slowdown. That's what we're doing right now. We're continuing to teach and learn, and students will hold steady in their learning. They won't grow to where they possibly would have if we continued to be in school, but they will stay steady. And the last line that you see that looks like a dotted line is called the COVID slide. This suggests without any additional learning experiences that students will slide to this point. Now let's move down to third grade. So we've kind of went through the eighth grade, but I want you to notice specifically the third grade. The gaps for the third graders are larger than the gaps for the eighth graders. So that's important to think about. And that's true with any summer slide. The younger you are, the more the gaps in the slide. From the last day of school to the first day of the school in the fall semester. So we can go to the reading one now. While the reading graphs are similar, they're not as dramatic. And this is due to the nature of the difference between a course like math and a course like reading. Math tends to be processes and procedures in nature, and not as recursive as reading is and reading skills. For example, we talk about author's purpose in reading, and we talk about author's purpose with kindergartners, and we talk about author's purpose with 12th graders. So that continues to cycle and recycle in those over the years with more specificity, but things like math tend to be taught once. So let's think about the quadratic equation. You learn the quadratic equation and you use it over and over, but it's typically taught at one time. And if you miss that you there's a there's a large gap there that you have to go back and teach that specific concept. So I've taken a moment to set context around how we move forward because I think that's important. There's complex factors when you think about your next steps in your next considerations. So, We're beginning to discuss several options, and all these options that I'm gonna walk you through are specifically face-to-face. So this is to determine if we can get back into school. The first one is a summer option. We thought about 24 days of instruction, could be less, for all K through three students, and invitations for four through eight students. And our high school students would be similar to what we've always done, which was would be they would be open to courses that they would like to take. The next slide, this is another option. If we could not do summer, then we would look to try to begin school early. And the next two options actually are an extended school year for the 2021. This is, again, suggests starting early. We would perhaps pull in all elementary students because that's where we know the deepest slides are. But we also could think about which other students we might bring in after our elementary students. And then the last option that I'm putting in front of you is an extended school year. So this is an option to add days to the calendar at the end of the year. And that would be if we weren't able to come to school before we had in the first of August. I want to also preface, one of the things that will be important to us as we move forward is providing pre-assessments for the learning that students will do. These assessments would encourage teachers to understand before teaching a concept, skill, or process where and if there are learning gaps with the students that they have. And this will be critical as we move forward in the next couple of years. These are the discussions we've had about near term, summer, and back to school considerations. I'm happy to answer any questions or clarify any of these options, but I will say that these are early plans and that we haven't gotten in a great deal of specificity around them because we are just so unclear about what our next steps will be regarding being able to open.

The third option, I think, could get a little bit more complicated depending on who you wanted to extend the school year for, but we also know that as we move through the year, we may have some better revenue pictures or so that, you know, we could make those decisions a little later on as we go forward. We've also, I mean, as we start thinking about this, This could, you could think about something like this if you were to limit the number of students in school every day. So if you looked at some of the models that we're seeing in other countries, not every child is coming every day. So you might have half the students coming one day or 20% of the students coming. So there's some things like models like that that we really haven't explored yet. Because again, we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves.\"},\n",

I know all the board members love to get out and visit schools, but a school you might not be familiar with actually is Post High. It is actually a house that was bought and renovated into a a school where our students who are in our community-based instructional program at the high schools, when they graduate, they graduate from their high school, but they still can stay with the school system until they're 22 years old. So if they choose to, they can enroll at Post High, which it's a place where they have a lot of their medical needs met. They also have community there with several other students and staff. And in addition to that, it's a work-study program. So the students will come there, they learn and develop work skills, and then they go out into sheltered workplaces in the community where they can continue to build those work skills. Certainly last, this school year, they didn't have Thanksgiving dinner or lunch like they normally do, but Every year they do that and I would encourage board members to maybe think about that as part of your Thanksgiving plans next year if we're able to visit places because it's a very special school. It was part of the a wonderful vision many years ago. And I was very familiar with it because it was part of the Albemarle high school budget. So we would, you know, I'd go over and visit pretty frequently from being principal at Albemarle and I still enjoy the students and it's just a, it's a great place to go. But if you ever, if you just want to see it without going in right now, if you're concerned about transmission, you go to the back of Burleigh Middle School, and when you go to that back parking lot near where the baseball field is, it's a yellow house that's back there.

Whenever we look at these surveys, and my staff is well aware that whenever we look at them, there are many limitations to surveying, and so I think Looking at them as just one piece of a communication puzzle is really the best way to look at them. It's often helpful, but as I tell people, it's not a vote. It's just trying to gain a better perspective than what we might have just by hearing anecdotes.

So we formed a work session committee, it was comprised of staff and representative board members, including Miss Lee and Mr. O'Carroll. We have drafted topics for the remainder of the calendar year. Before we get into the topics, I want to first start with the purpose of work sessions. The school board implemented the use of work sessions to gain greater understanding of critical issues facing the division and to provide staff with direction and support in the division's strategic plan. So in other words, work sessions are an opportunity for deeper work. And typically, the first meeting of each month is a business meeting, and then the second meeting is a work session. The committee has drafted a common framework for each work session outlined here. All work sessions will have a direct connection to the strategic plan. They will be data-driven, connect to current policies, and then all will conclude with a common discussion and ensure clear purpose and direction with questions such as, what further information does the board need? What are the next steps for the board on that topic? And always tying back into our funding and budget cycle as well. So there are six remaining scheduled work sessions in the calendar year. And so for each, you will see a date, a topic, and then the connection to the learning for all goal and strategy or objective. And so the first three, which will take us to the end of the school year are listed here. Our next work session is on March 24th, and that will be on what we're calling the first part of two that are focused on achievement data. And the topic will be a mid-year data review. In April, we propose a work session on the CIP. This will be a more global approach on the process and program as a whole and not about specific projects and will be an opportunity to better understand how the county assesses affordability, forecasting, financing options, as well as how we produce enrollment projections and other data. In May, we will plan a session about school climate and mental health. This will include information on student climate data, our counseling and SEL programs, instructors, such as responsive classroom, design development, and freshman seminar. As we come back from summer, right, in August, we will start with a session about intervention services, and that will include RTI, SPED, ESOL, and our title programs. In September will be the second part of the achievement data discussion and that will focus on the year end data. It will also be an opportunity for the board to develop their goals for the 22-23 school year. And lastly, we will conclude with the work session about school board, community and stakeholder engagement. We're still working on the details of these, but we've talked about a deeper dive on the role of advisory committees, perhaps reflection on the work of the work you just discussed or other topics. So with that, I will ask if there's anything Mr. O'Carroll or Ms. Lee would like to add or expand on and then open it up for discussion and feedback.\"},\n",

One is, and this is post COVID, is that we need to, I think as a group, have a more public presence in our magisterial districts, in our schools. I know that just about everybody has still been going to see their schools during this period. And I hear about it when I'm in a school. And so it's very, very appreciated. And it really gives us a chance to see what's happening and how the kids are doing. And we all do have myriad stories about that. The second one is continued PD. And I think professional development is something that we're pleased where we are, but we can be better. And we can be better from learning more. And having conversations like these is a big part of it. But I think more PD, we had a great book study last year that was extremely worthwhile, in my opinion. And then the third one is, really working on developing the anti-racism policy and preparing our students for the most diverse population ever in the United States, that they will all be coming of age during that period. And I think preparing them through some of the things that we're doing and other things that will come through Dr. Hairston and his group and from members of the board, I think will be of great importance for all of us. And I would also throw in just a fourth one, I'll make it quick, is I'd really love to have all of us have a strong interest in the CIP projects. and to give a lot of thought to what our priorities should be. I know we're going to be getting a presentation on that coming up in October. And I sure would love everybody to be actively involved in that.\"}]},\n",

The question is going to be what are we actually capable of doing and implementing. And so that part, kind of the nuance of how we word our recommendation. Maybe I'm making an assumption. Maybe it's not just a given that smaller is better. So if the point of this is to kind of get how we feel, I would say for elementary school, I think small is good. But I don't know if that's reasonable. And if we have to decide where schools are going to be small or not small, I guess we should try to make them smaller where there's a higher concentration of economically disadvantaged students.

Most of the school systems, particularly, the reason I look at it this way, too, is all around Richmond, the school systems start after Labor Day. And so the capitals in Richmond, the governors in Richmond, the VDOEs in Richmond, also on the south side, Peninsula, they all start after Labor Day. So we're all, we're just kind of looking at it that way that how do we get in alignment with moving toward phase three? Now, I do think it's important to ask our community and that's why we did the survey. And I really appreciate the board's patience with us having an established calendar and then coming back and saying, hey, would y'all entertain asking the public? And I'm really grateful to all the families for chiming in and letting us know what you think. I will say that I did discuss, I have been in discussion with a post-Labor-Day start with city school staff from the very beginning of our conversations about this. And I asked if city school staff would be interested in looking at this type of calendar. I understood at that time that there was some interest. They have not asked their community yet through a survey as to whether they would begin after Labor Day or not. I think they might, I think they may, but I obviously have no way of influencing that other than through collaboration. We do have, I am working on scheduling a meeting with our counterparts in the city for next Wednesday to discuss not only the post Labor Day start, but also what we are looking at as we begin to firm up our school site plans around offering instruction to students. I know they had already published some things to their community and I think they're also interested in learning more about what we're gonna be doing. I think it's important to just say those things because I want the board to know that we are trying to coordinate with the city and with what they're doing. If we end up on different schedules, we're gonna work with our staff. We're gonna work with our teachers, with our support staff to make sure that we meet their needs and help them as they make their way back to work.\"},\n",

You'll notice that the first two years were two and 2.3% increases for classified staff and four and 3% increases for our teachers. The following year, due to the start of the pandemic, no increases were provided. And that takes us to the start of the current fiscal year where classified staff received 4% increases and teachers a 5.2 increase to their step scale. And due to the school board's commitment to its staff and teachers, as mentioned, there is a 4% mid-year being implemented in just a few days, along with the proposed 6% increase to start the next fiscal year. And if you're wondering how four plus six equals 10.2, it's because the 6% increase takes into consideration the 4% increase as well, they compound. So an employee will be 10.2% higher in July than they are this evening. Next slide, please. Next, we turn to what we anticipate will be a peak at our competitive markets come July 1 for our teachers. And we looked at the master's scale as our example this evening. This slide highlights a few key data points. First, we pulled compensation information for our adopted market, as well as the new metric market discussed with the school board at its December work session. We projected a 5% increase to the markets and projected the 6% increase for Elmore County Public Schools being proposed. We landed on 5% increase for our markets because we're following what the state's guidance is so far. Thanks to the school board support, the mid-year adjustment and the proposed July 1 adjustment have positively impacted the school division's position as compared to the top quartiles of our adopted market as well as the new metrics market. And importantly, when compared to our adjacent market, Albemarle is now not only competitive, but it's beating the market for teachers through the first 10 years of their careers. Our classified employees utilize a pay grade system, not a step scale like the teachers utilize, and the classified pay grade scales will also be adjusted to reflect the four and 6% increases accordingly.\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"So as we near the conclusion of this compensation section, this slide serves as an overview of the funding request. The compensation increase proposal total 17.2 million, allowing two increases totaling 10.2% for all staff by July 1st. The proposal also provides $880,000 to target certain positions deemed hard to fill and $350,000 to provide meaningful adjustments to employees impacted by recent changes to our payroll cycles. And while this funding request does not specifically address any changes that may be needed as a result of the comprehensive compensation study, this budget does account for a one-time funds of $3 million to address the study's critical needs, should there be. Go to the next slide, please. So revisiting the logic model methodology that Ms. Kumazawa mentioned earlier this evening. When we look at this strategy's outputs, we're looking towards exit survey data reflecting compensation, not being a main driver for leaving the school division. We're also looking towards engagement survey data indicating that the school division staff are not dissatisfied for reasons related to compensation. And we're also looking towards applicant pools being richer to the extent that we're no longer starting a school year with vacant teaching positions. When we look at these strategies outcomes, we're expecting employee retention rates to increase as well as experiencing improved exit data and improved engagement data as it relates to compensation being a reason for employee dissatisfaction or disengagement. At this time, I will, I believe, hand it back to Ms. Kamizawa for the next portion of the presentation, unless there are questions.\"},\n",

We'll have a steering team tomorrow with local government and debrief and keep planning. All those positive relationships that we've built over time, I think, are paying off in a time like this. The only way it could be worse is if we didn't have good communication and collaboration and really creative thinking in alignment with the local government. That would make it far worse, I think.

I'm a parent in Samuel Miller district of two kids who attend the Albemarle County Public Schools. I was also an employee, a teacher with the schools for 11 of my 17 years as a teacher. And I'm speaking tonight as a parent to express gratitude to the members of the board and to all the employees in the schools. And I want to say, I love seeing student representation on the school board. That's very cool. To the board members, thank you for everything that you do for our kids every day, I know it can be a thankless job sometimes. Most recently, I want to thank you for following Virginia law SB 1303 the CDC guidelines and our pediatricians Virginia chapter for the American Academy on pediatrics on masks. This is going to give us the best shot at keeping our school buildings open. It gives us the best shot at keeping our staff and students and their families safe. And it also allows us to recruit and retain the best in the business because people can see that you're making common sense decisions and that you care about your employees. So thank you. To any parents that are watching, you know, I invite you to join me in expressing gratitude to all the people who work for our schools. It's been a tough couple of years. I did, I was in charge of virtual school for my kids. And I know it's been tough for parents and it's been tough for staff too. So just, you know, I invite you to share a short email, a call, a note, a quick conversation to express some grace and gratitude to the people who do the work. And I'm talking about the school bus drivers who are the first ones to see our kids in the morning and the last in the afternoon, the cafeteria staff who prepare meals for our children. The teachers in the teacher's age who inspire a love of learning in our kids and teach them to think critically about tough weighty issues. The front office staff who are fantastic in interacting with the families, the administrators, the custodial staff who give the kids a sense of pride in learning in a clean and safe environment, the counselors, on and on. Let's thank them. In closing, I just want to say that my sons love attending Albemarle County Schools. They feel safe, they feel supported, and they feel loved. So my message is keep doing what you're doing, and this community will have your back. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Hickey.\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"Yes, thank you. Good evening. First of all, I would also like to thank the school board administrators, teachers for your continued support to provide an inclusive, equitable and truthful education to our students in Albemarle County. My name is Sarah Lepore. I'm a nurse practitioner and a mother of children attending the Western feeder schools, including a fourth grader who is autistic and has two rare genetic disorders. I am here today to urge you to continue to follow the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation and the CDC guidelines on COVID policies, which include universal masking indoors for all students and staff. While I agree that we eventually need to consider an off ramp for COVID mitigation steps, Now is not the time to lower our guard. Instead, we should be focusing on obtaining better masks for students and teachers in order to limit the spread and keep kids in school. Already this week, my middle schooler had two teachers out and multiple classmates. Without masking, there will be many more absences and loss of instruction time. I believe the goal should be to limit the disruption from in-person school, and the best way to do this is to continue masking as well as continue the entire COVID mitigation plan. I ask that you focus on listening to experts like the entire AAP and CDC and only decrease COVID mitigation when our community spread is much lower and positivity rates have decreased. I also ask you to not allow the politicization of masking to influence your decisions. Positivity rates remain high and the vulnerable population is very much part of our community. This includes my child, many other children that attended the schools, some of our county's teachers, administers and ancillary staff. Reasonable precautions like getting vaccinated, wearing better masks and improved ventilation and filtration are not draconian measures at this point in time and will help to keep our students and teachers safe. Preventing people from getting sick is the most helpful strategy to keeping schools open and keeping students and teachers in school. Right now, we need every strategy to make that happen. As you know, our local hospitals are seeing record number of COVID patients and nursing and medical staff are exhausted and understaffed. It is not the time to change guidelines that potentially could compromise our healthcare system. You may have heard the term focus protection recently. Focus protection means healthy children can go back to normal while those at risk either wear N95s or worse stay home. The concept of focus protection is not an equitable choice. It does not actually protect the vulnerable population. And last I checked, there's not a child size N95 manufactured in the US at this time. What do you think could happen when only the vulnerable kids and at-risk teachers are asked to wear masks to protect themselves while everybody else does not have to? I believe the risk of highlighting who is vulnerable in an already stressed situation could possibly lead to negative behavior, like maybe an increase in bullying. It will be harder for kids to do the right thing when their peers aren't having to wear masks. We must never consider following a policy recommending significantly at-risk kids to stay home during increased community transmission.\"},\n",

And I also want to express my appreciation to the school board and staff, teachers, bus drivers, everyone for doing what they can to keep our kids in school safe. The last two years. The last couple years have been a real struggle, but for many people like me and my family. We were all able to get vaccinated and it felt like things were starting to get back to normal and we all want that so badly, but we've got to acknowledge that we're just not there yet there's still many people in our community. who are extremely vulnerable to the virus as they have been from the beginning. Nothing has changed for them. And some of them are kids and staff at our schools. They're people we live with and go home to and people we work with. And they do not have a choice in the matter. I believe it's our moral obligation to do everything we can to protect the most vulnerable people in our community. I think politicizing public health policy like masking that is scientifically proven to work is shameful and forcing our kids and teachers to deal with the controversy within the classroom where the focus should obviously be on learning is sad and it doesn't serve anyone well. I believe following CDC and our local health districts guidelines at this time is the most reasonable way to prevent the spread of COVID in and outside of our schools. and I appreciate you for continuing to follow them.

And one of the things that I also know is that just because a person is in a high-risk category, we can't force them to not work. So one of the things that we're going to have to do as we move forward is we're really going to have to work with our, our intention is for our supervisors to work with the staff, all staff, to determine are there underlying conditions that are going to prevent them from coming into work. if they are they going to feel comfortable coming in? Is that something that they are planning to do? We're developing a list of questions that will become guiding questions that our supervisors will work with their staffs on to determine what their actual needs are. This is something that once we have a better sense of what we talked about, learning more about our students and who's coming back that will also help us help guide us with what we're going to need staff wise to support those. And from there, what we will do is one of the things in the document, it talks about some accommodation and obviously you know virtual is an easy accommodation or relatively easy accommodation for. for teachers, but you're exactly right. That does not apply for other staff members. We've talked about, are there ways to reassign people to other situations that may allow them to do work that they may not have been able to do in their original job? And so those are some of the things that we're wrestling with. One of the things that I think is helpful to know is as we brought people back in for our first phase of our employees coming back into work, at this point, we've only had two people, I believe, that have needed to not come in yet. And so I'm hopeful that I know that right now there's a lot of unknowns and with the not knowing exactly start date and schedule and what school is going to look like, I know that there's a lot of angst for our employees around that.

This is, you know, kind of what we do every day and I think Elmer County was one of the first school systems to reach out and really start. having pediatricians help, and we've been grateful, and I think the partnership has been particularly valuable. One of the great things, as Dr. Vergalis just outlined, is that we got to experience last year and learn about what mitigation strategies work. I think that Albemarle County schools were maybe the first to go ahead and put out their universal masking this year, which was incredibly beneficial To have that out there, we think it's incredibly important, particularly as we go into the Delta variant time where we know contagiousness is such a factor. And we were able to learn last year that masks really do work to keep our kids safe, our staff and teachers safe, and keep our schools open. And I would say as pediatricians that the most important thing to us, and we appreciate that you all have had this on the forefront as well, is to have kids have as many in person days of school this year as possible. These mitigation strategies are going to allow us to do that. So, you know, masking the ventilation efforts that the school system has gone to using some distance being outside whenever you can, of course handwashing. And some basic hygiene things, as well as vaccination for as many 12 and up folks in the school that we can have all those things together are really going to be incredibly useful. We all hope, particularly in our high schools. where everybody in the high school is able to be vaccinated, that we can start talking about something different at some point, but we are clearly not in that moment. And we are really grateful for this great set of mitigation strategies going into the new year. I think Dr. Armengol is gonna talk a little bit about vaccine.\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"Page Nod, if you can hear me. Okay, great. I'm sorry, I'm having some technological difficulties. My apologies, I don't have a camera, which I very much dislike, but I just wanted to let everybody know on the board that we're very appreciative. Thank Dr. Acuff for her very nice words. It's very appreciated. I just wanted to mention that one of the tools that we have in our toolbox this year that we really didn't have until really late last year is the vaccination. I know everyone who has not had one is concerned about the safety and the fact that it came so fast. But this vaccine has been a miracle, really. It was developed in under a year. It was developed with very good science. And I don't know of any vaccine that's ever had so many doses given in such a short time. I would say over 200 million doses right here in the United States. and thus far it's proved to be rather safe. And I just wanna underscore to the families out there who've been a little reluctant that they should go ahead and get their vaccine. It's really important. The pandemic has become a pandemic of the unvaccinated. If you look at the hospital numbers, it's clear that 98 to 99% of those being admitted to the hospital are unvaccinated. The same is true of those who are dying. And just in the last two weeks or less, the number of patients admitted to the UVA hospital has doubled. And I don't see an end to that. I think it's gonna get worse before it gets better. And the way to prevent that is for as many people as possibly can get their vaccine. Of course, not everyone can get a vaccination. The current vaccine is authorized for use in kids 12 and up The one that we use in that age group is the Pfizer vaccine, which is a two-dose vaccine. It's given three weeks apart. It's available pretty much anywhere that you want to get it, including numerous doctor's offices, the health department, numerous mobile clinics. They'll even come out to your home and do it at your home if you have an inability to get around. And that can be arranged through the health department. So there's really, I think we've tried to remove as many obstacles as possible to getting the vaccine. Everyone is curious about when the children under 12 will get vaccinated. We are as well. We're fortunate at our office that we're participating in the study for the Pfizer vaccine in that age group. We have a little bit of an insight on that. And unfortunately, Unlike what you've seen in the press here lately, we do not expect to see authorization of the vaccine in the kids under 12 until December. The FDA has requested a four to six month period of data collection. And we can tell you that the kids who were enrolled in the study in that age group did not complete their series until early to mid July and thus, if you count four to six months from there, that takes you into early winter. I'd like to think it would come faster and sooner, and maybe something will happen to allow that. But realistically, I think we're looking at early winter before we're vaccinating the kids under 11. And so I think, as I said earlier, this is one more tool in the toolbox. The way to prevent spread in the schools is to continue using all the tools in the toolbox. And that includes all the mitigation strategies that Dr. Perriello has mentioned already, plus using the vaccination where we can. I'll return it back to you all.\"},\n",

As authorized by ordinance of the County of Albemarle, the school board will hold its meetings electronically during the COVID-19 pandemic. The school board is nevertheless committed to encouraging public comment despite its need to meet on a virtual basis. For this reason, there will be two ways for the public to provide comment. First, as always, they may be submitted to the school board clerk prior to the start of the meeting and will be disseminated to all of the school board members for review. Secondly, members of the public wishing to provide public comment during the school boards meeting may sign up online at our website by 4pm the day before the meeting, the clerk will email zoom links to the speakers on the day of the meeting, so that they can log into the meeting to provide comment. Before electronic public comment commences, the vice chair will announce the order in which the speakers will comment. Public commenters will initially be admitted to a waiting room area on Zoom until it is their turn to speak. There, they'll be able to hear the meeting in progress while they wait. Each speaker's access to public comment will be activated when it is that speaker's turn to provide comment to the members of the school board. The speakers will be notified when they reach the two-minute mark. And at the three-minute mark, the speaker's Zoom link will be automatically deactivated. Although the school board is confident that public comment will proceed in an orderly and respectful manner, upon instruction from the chair, the clerk has the ability to disconnect a speaker who is disruptive, profane, or fails to abide by these guidelines. Speakers during the meeting or those submitting written comment should state name and address or magisterial district. Simply stating Albemarle County is not adequate. The school board will not respond to comments made during the public comment period. School board members may address comments at the end of the meeting agenda under other business.

       "    'content': \"I'm Vernon Lectee. I'm a teacher at Elmorrow High School, and I currently vote in the Jack Jewett District. I'm here to talk about collective bargaining. As public school teachers, my colleagues and I have been humbled by the support we receive from the parents, the board, and the public during the coronavirus pandemic. We've all seen posts on social media from folks who say things like, we should pay teachers a million dollars, or I didn't realize that their jobs are so hard. While we appreciate the sentiment, most teachers will tell you that they don't need a million dollars. What we need is the dignity of a voice on the job. For those that are not aware, collective bargaining is simply a process of negotiation between employers and their employees. Police, firefighters, and teachers have concerns related to workload, compensation, staffing levels, and safety. We want to make sure that classrooms are not overcrowded and that emergency responders have the resources they need because our work conditions affect the vast majority of Virginians. Collective bargaining allows localities to partner up with their employees, so they better understand these concerns and work together to address them. Fortunately, the General Assembly of Virginia has passed legislation that could grant Albemarle employees collective bargaining rights. The legislation empowers the localities and the school boards to give us those collective bargaining rights. This law will go into effect in May of 2021, and is now up to the school board to give the employees these rights. There is no inherent cost to collective bargaining. Giving teachers the power to negotiate a contract does not mean the school boards or localities are forced to spend money that they don't have. Rather, collective bargaining is about working within the realm of what is possible to achieve the best possible result for everyone. Workers who are on the ground are often in the best position to identify inefficiencies and waste that they witnessed firsthand. Furthermore, teachers' working conditions are the students' learning conditions. We want smaller class sizes so that we can give your children more attention. We want adequate planning time so that our students can get high quality lessons. And we want a consistent discipline policy so that consequences are fair across the board and not influenced by influential racial bias. Our contracts typically run in the ranges of two pages. The wording is intentionally vague and teachers feel pressure to take on extra responsibilities without additional time or additional compensation. We need clarity and we need protection. So many people in the past few weeks have expressed their respect for our teachers, firefighters, and public sector workers who continue to deliver essential services through this pandemic. But you can't support teachers if you don't support giving us the freedom to join a union and bargain collectively, as our counterparts in the private sector can do. Our students deserve the best. This school division is stepping up to ensure our students have the support they need to finish the semester. We're not turning back on these kids in the middle of a pandemic, and we're asking that our elected leaders not turn their backs on us. I encourage the Albemarle County School Board and the Albemarle County Board of Supervisors to grant its employees the right to collectively bargain. Listen to firefighters, police, and teachers. Show us that you truly do respect our professional opinions and give us a seat at the table. Thank you.\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"I'm sorry, I was listening to your live stream and was a little bit behind in this schedule. Good evening, school board members. I'd like to introduce the item for the comprehensive annual financial report. Each fiscal year, the county as a whole completes an integrated single audit of all of our financial conditions for both the schools and local government in a single audit. And today we would like to present to you the audit, the comprehensive annual financial report. And we will have Mr. Josh Rohwer partner with Robinson Farmer Cox, our auditors. Presenting the financial report, Mr. Rohler has been a valued member of RFC for 14 years and has been part of the audit committee, audit team for quite a number of those 14 years. Also, I'd like to mention that this, the financial report was discussed with the audit committee in November. And this is the formal presentation of the audit report to you tonight. And what I will be doing is bringing up the pages of the audit itself that Mr. Roller is speaking about. It will be very small on most people's screens, but the report is attached. And Mr. Roller, as he's making his presentations, will be listing the page that he's discussing and y'all can bring it up individually if you wish and make it larger as we move through this process. Mr. Roller, are you online?\"},\n",
       "   {'role': 'Speaker_16',\n",
       "    'content': \"I am here. I'm ready to go if it's on me. First off, we'll start with the letter, if you can pull it out. Yeah. So like Jackson just introduced, my name is Josh Roller with Robinson Farmer Cox. We're the auditing firm. We're based out of Charlottesville here. Tonight, here to present the fiscal year 21 audit report for the county and school board. And also, like was mentioned, In November, there was an audit committee meeting where we went over the whole report, the whole letter, and in much more detail than I'm going to today. I'll just kind of point your attention to a few things and be happy to answer any questions you guys have at the end. So starting with that letter, this is the communication with those charged with governance. This is the standard communication required at the end of the audit. First thing I'll point your attention to is that first paragraph under significant audit matters there talks about how there was one new accounting principle that was adopted this year. It was GASB 84. How it affected the school board was that the school activity funds that all the different schools have, we do separate audits on them on an annual basis. With this new implementation of GASB 84, those now have to be included in the county and school board annual report. Once we get into the actual financial statements, I'll show you how that actually affected the financials, but it is something that will be a theme throughout this. And if we can go to the next page, actually, we can go to the report from there, Jackson.\"},\n",
       "   {'role': 'Speaker_3', 'content': 'So I believe we are on page 26.'},\n",
       "   {'role': 'Speaker_16',\n",
       "    'content': \"Correct. Yep. So starting on page 26, this is the second page of the independent auditor's report. This is where we have issued an unmodified opinion for the county and the school board this year, which is a clean opinion, the best opinion that we can give you all. The second and third paragraphs on this page here is a change in the accounting principle, the restatement of beginning balances, are both to referencing what I was just talking about there with the GASB 84. You will see on the financial statements, the beginning balances of the net position and beginning fund balances were restated, but that was solely because of this, the implementation of GASB 84. So now we can flip forward quite a bit to page 186, page, 186 is the balance sheet for the school board itself. As you can see, there's a school operating fund, the school food service fund, school capital projects fund, and what's new this year is that school activity funds. And that number there is combined of all of the schools together. And if you flip forward two more pages to page 188, You'll see in that third column there at the very bottom of the page, the fund balance at the end of the year as restated, that $3.1 million. That was the annual balance from the school activity fund audit report last year. That's just rolled forward into the beginning balance for this year on the annual report here for the county since it was new implementation this year. And then flipping forward to page 213, Page 213, this is our auditor's report on internal controls over financial reporting. As part of the audit process, we have to do various tests of controls on the county and school board over payroll, accounts payable, receiving money, revenues reported. And as part of our audit process, nothing came to our attention that needed to be reported in this. At the bottom, it talks about deficiencies and internal controls. There's two different levels of deficiencies where there's significant deficiency and material weakness. We had nothing to report on this letter for any of those. So a clean slate there as well. And flipping forward two more pages to 215. 215, this is our audit report over the federal compliance piece of the county and school board, which increased quite a bit this year with all the CARES and COVID funding. We're required to test various programs depending on size, depending on complexity, and depending on the last time they were audited. And the programs that we had to audit this year as part of the single audit process, we had no issues that came to anything that has to be reported as an issue of noncompliance. So again, another clean slate there. And the last piece I'll point your attention to is the schedule of expenditures of federal awards. This is page 217 through 219. The school board piece is reported starting at the bottom of 218 and mostly on 219 here. And as you can see at the bottom of page 219, the total federal expenditures for the school board piece this year was $14,291,000. A couple of things that are a little unique and new this year. The first program at the top of that page there, the COVID-19 Coronavirus Relief Fund is $2.4 million. And then down close to the bottom under COVID-19 Education Stabilization Fund, another around $2 million there. So as you can see, for this year, compared to previous years, there was around $4.4, $4.5 million of federal revenues that were expended during the year. And that's my quick spiel. I'll be happy to answer any questions you guys have.\"},\n",

But still, the stress level that the student would be exposed to would be one criteria to decide whether or not we should reduce the number of AP courses. The second one was college guidelines, whether or not by doing that, we would affect our students' ability to be enrolled at certain colleges, whether certain colleges would look and reduced AP numbers as sort of a bad thing. And then the third thing I think we talked about was the personal interests of a student. By reducing the AP courses, individual students might be better able to enroll in classes of their personal interests.

There's a huge diversity across our school division. And so my question is really at the board level.

       "    'content': \"Absolutely. Thank you, Mr. Alcaro. Good morning, board members. My name is Pat McLaughlin. I'm chief of strategic planning for the school division. And in recent weeks, we've shared with you some updated version of our school calendars. And today, we'd like you to take action by selecting a start date for the 2020-2021 school year. I'll begin with a quick reminder of our timeline. On June 18, we shared with you the results of our calendar survey, and also shared with you our return to school planning guide, which you spent some time unpacking on the 19th. This week and next, we've been meeting with principals and department leaders about possible scheduling scenarios for next year, and today we'll launch a survey for our families to provide feedback about their plans for next year. Today, we'd like the board to vote in a start date for the 2020-2021 school year, and at our meeting on July 9th, staff will present an attendance schedule for the year. Based on a number of factors, including teachers' desire for additional preparation time, the results of our calendar survey, and the planning of our school schedules, which are beginning to come into greater focus, staff is recommending that we start school on Tuesday, September 8th. It's important to note that this year's calendar will need to be somewhat fluid and will likely undergo additional modifications once a return to school scheduling plan has been adopted. For example- Did you stop your presentation?\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"Yep. Sorry. That's okay. For example, if students are not in school every day and we have a built-in planning and development days for teachers each week, we would not need to delineate these days as non-student days in the calendar like we have in the past. Students would be accessing school on these days, and we would plan to count them as part of the 180 days of the school year. This would allow us to shift the final day of the school year to an earlier date. Should we enter a phase of recovery during the school year that allows all students to return to school in person, that could also have an impact on the calendar. However, our traditional school breaks, including Thanksgiving, winter, and spring break, would not be changed so that families can make plans for these holidays. We also realized that each of the September date calendar, September start date calendars that we've shared with the board had the final school day where the Juneteenth holiday would be observed next year. We will not have school on this day for students or staff next year and believe our final day of school would likely be earlier that week with the modifications that we may make to the calendar. Finally, I wanna let the board know that this week we met with the executive leadership team of the Charlottesville City Schools to share our thinking behind our return to school plan and our updated calendar drafts. We'll meet with them again in coming weeks to discuss the board's decision today as they plan for next year. So if there are any questions prior to taking action, I'll be happy to address them now.\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"Thanks, Rosalyn. I'm going to shift gears a little bit now to student enrollment. These numbers here, I'll go through each column, but the first column is showing our original capacity calculations. We have not adjusted those for K-12. The second column here is showing the September 9th actual enrollment data, which was shared with you earlier this month. The third column is showing the the original projections for the current year. So what we thought we were going to get in terms of enrollment for this fall. And then the last column is showing the fifth year of those original projections. The purpose of this is to show you that while our enrollment is lower currently than what we anticipated, and it's still fluctuating every day, there are still some schools that are noted in red where the enrollment does exceed the current capacity. So I'll just give you a minute to look at that. The Red Hill and Scottsville capacities do include the additional space as a result of the current renovations. So looking forward, we have begun the planning process for developing enrollment projections, our 10-year enrollment projections. We have decided at this time, as you know, we are pushing the entire operating budget process. We're delaying that by about a month for each step of the way. So we are going to mirror that in the enrollment projections. That extra time will buy us more time to collect more data and to really look at our methodology to see what will be most appropriate to move forward with these projections. I think most importantly, we will be working with a lot of our partners, which we have previously, but there will be a special focus on this year. So that'll be the Weldon Cooper Center, who we've worked with in the past to develop enrollment projections. We will make sure to connect with principals and OAs who know the most what's happening in their schools and their communities. We're gonna do a deep dive with the Long-Range Planning Advisory Committee about what our methodology will be. And as always, we will partner closely with the Community Development Department and local gov, and we will turn to industry best practices or as much as they can be developed throughout this fall and winter. We will do a deep analysis by school, by grade level, by feeder patterns to really determine, to really understand what happened this year, and we will do as much data collection as we possibly can. And then finally, we will. Flex where we are currently and then an upper end that better reflects our status quo where we would have been before the pandemic. And again, the focus for the range will be that we may use a different set of projections, whether it's for operating resource allocations for the short term, or whether it's facilities planning for the long term. We'll sort of need that wiggle room and that range to really make the best decisions. So that's the first part of the agenda to understand where we are and what's happening.

We knew that we wouldn't need the construction money anytime soon, so it was paused. And same with the Crozet. And that's why they we were able to fund the design and not the construction.

       "   {'role': 'Speaker_13',\n",
       "    'content': \"Good evening. My name is Rosalyn Schmidt. I'm chief operating officer. Tonight, I just want to provide a brief update on four studies that are either underway or will be shortly that will help inform our long range facilities planning. So those four studies involve Mountain View Elementary, Lamb's Lane campus, the Brookhill Proffer site, and then renovations at Albemarle and Western Albemarle High Schools. First, I want to start with Mountain View Elementary as some background. Next fiscal year's capital budget now, with the passing of the Board of Supervisors budget earlier this month, officially includes a modest expansion of the school and some site improvements. Due to its limited site as well as an already large school size with over 700 students, no further expansion is recommended. And as stated when the project was first recommended, it addresses current space needs and minimal enrollment growth. So it is not intended to be a long-term solution and further study is recommended. So that's what this study will help us do. We have hired a consultant to help us develop a more long-term solution. They will be conducting a subdivision yield analysis to help us better understand potential growth and would develop options for consideration. And a key component of this study is to get stakeholder feedback. We are meeting with the staff tomorrow morning and the first community meeting is scheduled next week. The purpose of these initial meetings is to get a brainstorm on the topic. The project team will then develop specific options for consideration and return in June for feedback on those options. We estimate the work to conclude this summer and will present to the board for your consideration as you finalize your CIP requests. The second study I want to update you on is what we refer to as the Lambs Lane Campus. This is the campus that includes Albemarle High School, Jack Jewett Middle School, Greer Elementary School, Ivy Creek School, both of our building services departments and our vehicle maintenance facility, which houses our transportation department and fueling station. and it will soon be the new Boys and Girls Club Center. As you can tell by this aerial, and if you visited, it's a very dense and highly utilized area that needs further study to ensure that the campus is equitable and that we have a long range vision to best utilize the limited land that is available. So what we're doing in the short term is we are planning improvements on Lamb's Lane itself, science improvements and screening that is being installed along Limes Lane as a part of the Safe Route to Schools grant. And then, as well as the construction of the new Boys and Girls Club Center. For more long term planning, however, we are in the process of hiring a consultant to create a master plan for the area. The study would include community engagement, determine challenges, opportunities, and vision for the campus. And that would include recommendations for necessary traffic improvements, both vehicular and pedestrian, and a conceptual master plan for future use and opportunities, including potential relocation of our support services, staff offsite that would provide additional instructional opportunities in green space to the schools that remain on the campus. We estimate the master plan to be complete in about six to 12 months, and we'll report our findings to the board. The third study is related to the Brookhill proffer. So Brookhill is a development along 29 North on the East side of 29, just North of Polo Grounds Road, as you travel away from town. If you recall, as a part of that development, the county was proffered two parcels of land. One is actually in the development itself, which is intended to be the site for a future elementary school. And the second was actually not in the development, but across 29 between the Berkmar Extension and Ryle Mills Road, that long sliver of space that was intended for a comprehensive high school in the future. But as you can see in the language of the proffer, there's some flexibility and other uses for that property. As a reminder, it's a very narrow site with very challenging rock and terrain, and this is a visual of a school similar in size and amenities to Monticello High School. So this study is actually being done by the local government and county staff as directed by the Board of Supervisors. They have directed staff to engage in a study to evaluate additional uses of this site. While the high school will certainly still be considered, other options under consideration are the relocation of our vehicle maintenance facility as one example, but more technical analysis of the grades will inform the possibilities. This study is in the very preliminary phases. It is our understanding that staff is to present a proposal to the BOS about the scope and time on the study in June. We will keep apprised of the progress of that study. Lastly, I want to highlight work at Albemarle High School and Western Albemarle. If you recall, the high school facility planning study done by F&I back in 2017, which recommended the center model, also recommended improvements to existing schools. Due to the age and condition of the facilities, Albemarle and Western Albemarle were prioritized first. That study included a simple cost per square foot estimate for the work, but limited details on scope. So this study is intended to further define the scope and cost. We are also planning stakeholder engagement to better define priorities and opportunities. The study was previously underway, but was paused last spring due to economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic, but we have since re-engaged the consultant and have a scheduled completion by November. So again, that was a quick overview. But those are four, I think, exciting work underway. I hope it provides a glimpse of the early stages of work that will ultimately result in projects in our long-range facilities planning. And I hope you also see our commitment to get stakeholder feedback at beginning stages of a project's lifecycle. So I'll now open it up to any questions or comments you may have.\"},\n",

I know all the board members love to get out and visit schools, but a school you might not be familiar with actually is Post High. It is actually a house that was bought and renovated into a a school where our students who are in our community-based instructional program at the high schools, when they graduate, they graduate from their high school, but they still can stay with the school system until they're 22 years old. So if they choose to, they can enroll at Post High, which it's a place where they have a lot of their medical needs met. They also have community there with several other students and staff. And in addition to that, it's a work-study program. So the students will come there, they learn and develop work skills, and then they go out into sheltered workplaces in the community where they can continue to build those work skills. Certainly last, this school year, they didn't have Thanksgiving dinner or lunch like they normally do, but Every year they do that and I would encourage board members to maybe think about that as part of your Thanksgiving plans next year if we're able to visit places because it's a very special school. It was part of the a wonderful vision many years ago. And I was very familiar with it because it was part of the Albemarle high school budget.

I mean, they're balancing the concerns of our teachers With what we know from the science, most of our kids do better in the classroom. We've heard, we said at the very beginning of our work with COVID and trying to figure out a course that we would do the best we could follow the science. The science is imperfect and continuously evolving. But I think my best judgment is we can address many of these issues by offering parents the option to send their kids to school as outlined in stage four, but seriously work on our strategy for addressing the learning losses, but the continuing work we've been doing on racism, the adverse impacts on children's education, but really put the kids first.

So there's no magic to this. It's not meant to say this is what we want as a school division. but rather to give you some food for thought. The most important thing, though, for us, for the superintendent and the cabinet, is that we have some direction to pursue. We've had an SRO program for decades. We don't have an off-the-shelf substitute program. That's gonna require some research, some discussion, before we can bring back to you recommendations or at least options for you to consider hopefully in the near future. But we do need some time to do that. And this is what this resolution is meant to do, to have the board provide guidance to the superintendent on what we should be looking into. Some of the ideas we had, for instance, are the use to which the draft MOU that has not been even completed yet with the county, but which addresses many of the issues about which you could express concern. And that is making sure that law enforcement does not intrude on the rights and authority of the school division to handle its own disciplinary matters. The draft MOU also states the goals that Ms. Gelmer was kind enough to put on the screen, and that is to make sure that all children feel safe and secure so that they can thrive in the school system. But that said, we don't have any preconceived notions. These were some ideas that we thought we would put before you for your consideration, for your change, for your modification. But at the end of your discussions, what we're asking for is a resolution that will guide our actions going forward to make sure that we are able to come back to you with ideas, with options, with recommendations for your consideration to have some type of school security in the ACPS. I will tell you, one thing that you need to know when you have these discussions is that The state of Virginia, by law, does not require SRO programs. However, if a school division decides that it does want an SRO program, it must follow the model that's put out by DCJS. Now, I wish I could have given you that today as part of your package, and we'll get that to you as soon as possible. However, the website has had technical difficulties for over a week, has announced that they've had technical difficulties for over a week and that we are unable to access that. However, to give you a good idea of what it looks like, the draft MOU which you have in your possession does follow that. It goes beyond the MOU. It covers everything that the DCGS model has But it goes further to delineate the responsibilities clearly between the school division and the police department so that law enforcement and school disciplinary matters are clearly separated. And also to provide some additional, I don't know if responsibilities is the right word, but that the SROs in the schools would have different roles to play, not just to bring students into the law enforcement arena. In fact, one of the major goals of the draft MOU is to, as much as possible, keep students out of the law enforcement chain and allow the school to resolve its behavioral issues on its own without intervention of law enforcement. But as I said, those are all ideas for your consideration. And what we would just really appreciate is some very concrete direction from you so that we can go forward and provide you with the information that we hope will allow you to develop a new program for security in our schools.\"},\n",

       "   {'role': 'Speaker_20',\n",
       "    'content': \"Thank you, Dr. McLaughlin. I'm Rosalyn Schmidt, Chief Operating Officer. As we turn the corner towards the end of this school year, and as we started to develop what our spring COVID mitigation strategies will be, we first established what our goals will be with our spring plan. And these goals are outlined here. First, we want to continue to maintain a safe environment for our students and staff. Second, we want to align with the most current public health guidance. We are currently not in alignment with certain recommendations, so you'll see a common theme of this plan is to better align. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have followed the recommendations of the CDC, VDH, and Blue Ridge Health District, and we want to continue to do so. Third, we want to be transparent and communicate any changes. We know anytime we discuss changes, we know that we will be met with different thresholds of acceptance. So we want to make sure that we are committed to transparency and clarity of these changes. And lastly, we want to begin to transition to an endemic state with more sustainable infection control practices than what we currently have. So we've organized this plan into four categories. First, I will go over changes that will occur this month and related to student masking and our quarantine and isolation timelines. Next, we'll go over changes that will occur next month related to contact tracing. Third, we have a category of practices that will not change for the remainder of the school year. And lastly, we have items that operationally we cannot change and that are instead governed by the school board policy or resolution and cannot change until you as a board take action. So, starting this month, there are two key changes. One has already occurred, and that was effective March 1st masks are optional for students per the new state code. But second, effective March 14th, we will reduce some quarantine and isolation timelines to be more in line with CDC and VH guidance. Quarantine refers to an exposure. Someone who is identified as a close contact and is not up to date on their vaccines at this point must quarantine. Currently our practice is 10 days, but we will now reduce that to five days, which is the CDC and VDH guidance. And it's five days from the last date of exposure, but they must remain asymptomatic and they must have a negative test. So we've developed some tests to return procedures and those apply to both students and staff. Isolation, that refers to when a person has tested positive for COVID-19 and has to stay home. For staff, we will reduce that timeline now to five days, assuming certain conditions are met. They must be fever free, their symptoms have improved, and a negative test on day five or later. They also must consistently wear a mask and distance when around others on day six through 10. Our isolation timeline for students, however, will remain at 10 days. We acknowledge that the CDC and VDH guidance does give a five-day option, but part of that guidance is that the individual masks for days six through 10. Unfortunately, the removal of our mask requirement creates risk in a scenario where we can't require masking, and furthermore, it's difficult to manage logistics of schools such as eating and other times when a mask has to be removed. So those are changes that are happening this month. So fast forward to next month in April. In April, we will suspend contact tracing for individual cases and utilize only when there are outbreaks and sustained transmission. So contact tracing refers to the process in which our school nurses and infection control team members identify who has been exposed when someone has COVID-19 and has been in school while contagious. We will suspend those efforts, but isolation practices will remain and quarantine practices for household members will still be expected. This change aligns with the current guidance of the VDH, which is that schools are no longer expected to contact trace every individual case and matches the health district's current practice for community cases. Again, going back to that second goal of being in alignment with the current guidance. It is current guidance, but we are not doing it sooner because we want to ensure we know the impact of the mask policy. So to date, we have had very limited conversions of those quarantined individuals turning into positive cases. So we are confident in removing that risk mitigation, but again, we want to ensure that the removal of masks does not impact our transmission rates. And then the other change that will occur in April is that we will modify requirements for a negative test or a doctor's note. Our current practice is to exclude any student who is displaying any symptom of COVID-19 and require either a negative PCR test or a doctor's note before returning. We know one of our best mitigation strategies is to ensure sick kids stay home, but as we enter the spring allergy season and our case rates go down and PCR testing availability in our community may be less accessible, this approach may no longer be practical. So more work to come on this, exactly what this will be, but there will be modifications. We wanted to foreshadow that change. So then the third category is that these are the practices that we plan on keeping for the remainder of the year. These include maximizing social distancing, including during lunch. We will continue to maintain a signed and consistent seating charge, encouraging eating outdoors, frequent hand-washing, all of our improved ventilation strategies. We wanna keep our commitment to the transparency. So we will maintain our COVID case dashboard. So the families and staff know how many cases are in our schools. We will continue to maintain testing sites for employees and masks will continue to be available for students and staff. So the last category I want to touch upon are those items that require board action. And that includes our staff and visitor mask requirement, as well as our staff vaccination or weekly test requirement. Some timing considerations are identified here, including the community levels and current CDC guidance on masking, the easing of the DOLI requirements, which are workplace requirements requiring masks that have gone away, and then just timing consideration of the overall context of all the other changes going on and when changes to these two policies may be considered. In addition to these topics, had a school health advisory board last night and they talked about this plan and these items as well. They did not come to consensus as they acknowledge that there are many paths forward, but there was general consensus that any change in mitigation strategies should be tied to the level of community transmission. So we will share the full minutes of their discussion once finalized, but that occurred last night. So in summary, here is our spring plan, our goals that I went over, the four goals, and then the list of changes that will occur this month, next month, that won't change, and then ones that require board action. So with that, I'll open it up for questions and any discussion.\"},\n",

As authorized by ordinance of the County of Albemarle, the school board will hold its meetings electronically during the COVID-19 pandemic. The school board is nevertheless committed to encouraging public comment despite its need to meet on a virtual basis. For this reason, there will be two ways for the public to provide comment. First, as always, they may be submitted to the school board clerk prior to the start of the meeting and will be disseminated to all of the school board members for review. Secondly, members of the public wishing to provide public comment during the school boards meeting may sign up online at our website by 4pm the day before the meeting, the clerk will email zoom links to the speakers on the day of the meeting, so that they can log into the meeting to provide comment. Before electronic public comment commences, the vice chair will announce the order in which the speakers will comment. Public commenters will initially be admitted to a waiting room area on Zoom until it is their turn to speak. There, they'll be able to hear the meeting in progress while they wait. Each speaker's access to public comment will be activated when it is that speaker's turn to provide comment to the members of the school board. The speakers will be notified when they reach the two-minute mark. And at the three-minute mark, the speaker's Zoom link will be automatically deactivated. Although the school board is confident that public comment will proceed in an orderly and respectful manner, upon instruction from the chair, the clerk has the ability to disconnect a speaker who is disruptive, profane, or fails to abide by these guidelines. Speakers during the meeting or those submitting written comment should state name and address or magisterial district. Simply stating Albemarle County is not adequate. The school board will not respond to comments made during the public comment period. School board members may address comments at the end of the meeting agenda under other business. And tonight we have five speakers. They will speak in this order. Vernon Leichty, Murray Sekalski, whose name I butchered, Kevin Owen, Amy Gardner, and Cheryl Knight.

So you're saying a policy we had put in place last year to help eliminate the disparity, the proportional disparity of who we suspend was only implemented with our black students and that now it's implemented with Hispanic and multiracial so that overall we're not disproportionately suspending minorities at a rate we don't approve of.\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"And I would add that the goal that we set that I put in front of the school board, because we knew as the overall suspension number was going to be reduced, it would make the percentage for minority students grow. So what we said, the whole goal is not there. In other words, we said that we were going to reduce the number of suspensions for Black students in particular by 20. And as of February, it was by 30. So because the overall number comes down, as you can see, the percentage doesn't go down as much as it could. And I like Ms. Colson's question because it really, the real work So on one level we've done, I think we've done some heavy lifting because we're trying to control the actual suspension decision of the administrator at the school. The deeper work is going to be drilling down and really be looking for patterns in teacher referrals and staff referrals. Because the issue is once the referral is written and once the incident happens or it's interpreted as to happen, then the referral is written and then all of a sudden it lands in the principal's office and then the principal has to do something with it. What we want to be able to do is to start looking for patterns in our teachers and the numbers of referrals that they write, the numbers of referrals that they write disparately impacting minority students. And then working with those staff members with professional development so that they can become more culturally responsive and less punitive in their work with the students. And the piece that Nick talked about earlier where he worked with Mark Leach to develop an electronic discipline referral, that's really the key because we're developing dashboards now that'll be coming to the board pretty soon. Sarah Dusenberry's working on those. And right now we're still using suspensions as a climate aspect of the dashboard for a school. And again, that's after the referral's already written. And so there's that whole layer underneath it that we need to tap into and expose and put in front of the board and start to get strategic about how do we work with the classroom teachers.\"},\n",

Specifically, the School Board will establish its members' salaries by affirmative vote between May 1st and June 30th annually. If the salary increase is approved by an affirmative vote, then the increase will take effect on July 1st. Currently, Albemarle County School Board members receive an annual salary of $6,907. The current chair stipend is an additional $1,800 annually, and the vice chair receives a stipend of $35 per meeting chair. The Board of Supervisors also pays its chair a stipend of $1,800 annually, and the vice chair a stipend of $35 per meeting shared. Typically, the school board increases its salary by the same increase provided to classified staff. If the board follows the same increases classified, then the salary beginning July first 2020 would remain at $6,097. Before discussion, may I please have a motion to direct the board clerk to advertise for public hearing a school board member's salary of $6,907 with a chair stipend of $1,800 and a vice chair stipend of $35 per meeting shared.

Attached to your board item, you have a number of documents. One is the draft calendar for the 2021-2022 school year. Also, you have the results of our community survey that is in there. The calendar committee, which is made up of teachers, administrators, and parents from both school divisions, began meeting in December and developed a first draft calendar that was shared with our community in January. The calendar looks very similar to calendars we've used in the past, with the first day of school for students on August 25th and the final day of the school year falling on June the 10th. We shared the calendar with the public in January, and over 2,500 community members responded to our calendar survey. When rated on a five-point scale of how satisfied they were with the calendar, with five being the most satisfied, 93% of respondents rated their satisfaction at a three or higher. The committee met for a second time after feedback was received and decided that no significant changes were needed based on the survey results. On the committee's recommendation, we're submitting this calendar to the board for the first viewing tonight and plan to bring it back on the consent agenda at the school board work session on February 25th for approval and adoption. So that's all I had to present to the board tonight and we'd be happy to take any questions or hear any comments of the board if there are any.\"},\n",

As authorized by ordinance of the county of Albemarle, the school board will hold its meetings electronically during the COVID-19 pandemic. The school board is nevertheless committed to encouraging public comment despite its need to meet on a virtual basis. And because of that change, we'll have two main changes or two main ways of having people communicate with us. First, written comments may be submitted to the school board clerk prior to the start of the meeting and will be disseminated to all of the school board members for review. Secondly, members of the public wishing to provide public comment during the school board meeting may sign up online at our website by 4pm the day before the meeting. The clerk will email Zoom links to the speakers on the day of the meeting so that they can log into the meeting to provide comment. Before electronic public comment commences, the vice chair will announce the order in which the speakers will comment. Public commenters will initially be admitted to a waiting room on Zoom until it is their turn to speak. They will be able to hear the meeting in progress while they wait. Each speaker's access to the public comment will be activated when it is that speaker's turn to provide comment to the members of the school board. Speakers will be notified when they reach the two-minute mark, and at the three-minute mark, the speaker's Zoom link will be automatically deactivated. Although the school board is confident that public comment will proceed in an orderly and respectful manner, upon instructions from the chair, the clerk may deactivate the speaker's mic at any time. Speakers during the meeting or those submitting written comment should state name and address or magisterial district. Simply stating Albemarle County for your address is not adequate. Although the school board will not respond to comments made during the public comment period, school board members may address comments at the end of the meeting agenda under other business.

And I would say that the one that we did in Kate's district and the one we did in Ellen's now district were the two best because we had great turnout. And we learned a lot from that. I still remember the stories in both of those. And in Whitehall, we had pulled pork. That's true. That's true. That was pretty good barbecue. Yeah, that was good. And it was great for us.

And I would like to respectfully request that we do so. I think there's a lot that could be said about it and probably more eloquently by some of our other board members.

And we're opening ourself up to a lot of optics problems and beyond optics. We're sending a message to our students. It's really easy to resolve since we already are not allowing students to wear Confederate imagery. And I think it's time that we make a resolution and move on.

       "    'content': \"Thank you, Mr. Oberg, and thank you to the board for having us this evening. I cannot stress enough the opportunity to just convey the importance of teaching the social studies right now in our community and in our world. This program, the National History Day program, is a nationwide program. I was introduced to it at the National Council for the Social Studies Convention over 10 years ago, which Albemarle County sponsored us to get to go to. And this program has really transformed my teaching from one of just content to one of passion and skills based on research and communication and the ability for students to tackle an argument and support that with legitimate research and supporting evidence that many times they won't even get to experience until maybe graduate school. And so the National History Day program is one that does give an opportunity for students to design program to design projects on a year long basis on a topic of their interest around a given theme. projects and present them in the way that fits them best from documentaries to websites, performances, exhibits, and papers. And for the last nine years, I'm proud to say our Western Albemarle students have competed at the division, state, and national level. with their projects and have just totally stunned me as a teacher. And it stayed with them. Just two days ago, I had an email from a student who is in her second or third year in college and in a J-term course. And she was emailing me because she was like, do you happen to have a picture of my group exhibit project that I can share with my course on protest and media. And with my J term professor and I was able to share that with her. And so it's a research element that teachers can implement in their classrooms that any and every student can take part of. That's what the majority of the program's about. But National History Day, under the generous contributions of many different museums and organizations around the country, also provide professional development opportunities for teachers and students. For teachers, I've been able to take courses in World War I, World War II, and interact with other teachers from around the globe, even. And through that, I learned of this program. It's called Sacrifice for Freedom, Recognizing Silent Heroes. And in the past, National Jewish Day has taken teachers and students to Normandy to recognize fallen soldiers in Europe. Last year, I saw the opportunity that National History Day kind of sends out for applications so that students and teacher pairs can do research on a local silent hero and then have the opportunity to study more about World War II in the Pacific by actually going to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. I put out this opportunity to our Social Studies Honor Society at Western Albemarle and a former student of mine, Virginia Ping, who actually did a National History Day project on the revolutions in China when she was a sophomore. She reached back out to me last year as a junior and said, I would love to try out for this opportunity. And so Virginia, I put together an amazing application that I supported and was submitted to the National History Committee, and we were selected as one of the teacher student pairs out of 129 applications. We were selected to be one of the 16 teams. And so our journey began last spring, where Virginia and I took in-depth courses, me with all the 15 other teachers and Virginia with the 15 other students on the history of Hawaii and the history of the war in the Pacific. So it was just amazing to connect to, you know, teachers in 14 other states and the American Samoa. And for Virginia to do the same, we continued our research and Virginia narrowed it down to Lieutenant Harlow, which she'll talk more about. And this continued throughout the year. We were supposed to go last June and then this past December to Hawaii to Pearl Harbor. It has been continued to push off. But we are now supposed to go again this upcoming June, thanks to wonderful grants from amazing museums like the USS Missouri Memorial Museum, which is the battleship where 75 years ago this upcoming September, World War II ended. That's the battleship where the peace treaty between Japan and the U.S. was signed. And Virginia and I will get the opportunity to actually spend the night on that ship. And so, you know, thanks to these museums and the National History Day program, we're getting an amazing research experience and just connections with other teachers around the globe. I'm going to introduce Virginia now. She is a senior at Western Albemarle High School. I got the pleasure of teaching her in ninth grade as a freshman and continued on with her historical studies. She's also passionate about the sciences. and in everything she does from cross country to her beautiful artwork. But she in this kind of crazy time, she has done the most to take advantage of opportunities like this. And so I'm going to let Virginia talk a little bit more about her research and her eulogy and what recognizing a lost serviceman from Albemarle County has meant to her. So, Virginia.\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"Thank you so much, Mrs. McKay. I have to say that without Mrs. McKay's support, I don't think it would have been possible for us to get selected, you know, as nationwide. And Mrs. McKay, ever since freshman year, she has really inspired me to learn with her genuine passion as an educator, as well as her curiosity for learning itself. And so You know, starting off with the project, like Ms. May said, we did a lot of learning and modules online and discussions. And then our task was to pick a silent hero and a fallen soldier from the Pacific Theater in World War II, which is what this program focuses on. And that serviceman would be from our home state. And so for us, it's Virginia. So during the research, definitely one thing that was special about Lieutenant Harlow was he attended the same elementary school that I had, Meriwether Lewis. And so that kind of caught my eyes at first. And then through a little bit more research, you know, I realized that he was a banker and he lived in Ivy, which is also very close to my home as well. And, you know, from a farm family, he really had a very normal life going on until the day that, you know, war erupted in his life change and his family's life change as well because he actually had three other siblings who were also in the Army and in the Air Force. So Lieutenant Bernard Harlow joined the Air Force and attended a Hobbs Army Airfield training school to become a bombardier and He later joined the 11th Bombardment Group and really was in the Central Pacific, and he accomplished many missions against the Japanese, including the Truk Island. missions and a lot of island hopping as well. And so being able to, well, first of all, the research broke down into early life, home front, and military life. And so for early life, I was able to connect with a lot of local librarians and historians, newspaper journalists, and even possible family members. So that was a learning experience because being able to reach out to people one-on-one and talking about the specifics of his early life. And then the home front research was more focused on Virginia and Charlottesville in general. And so through that, I was able to kind of do more readings on Virginia farmers at war, you know, the civil defense and the state militia in Virginia during World War II. and digging, you know, the UVA archives. And so there's really a lot of resources out there that normally I probably would not have even thought of exploring. And the bulk of the research is on military life. And so using Ancestry and National Archives and many other resources, I was able to collect important information on his enlistment training, promotions, missions, and his contributions during his time in service. And so I think, especially from this experience, I've really learned about, you know, there's so many, there's so many silent heroes who are just like Bernard, Lieutenant Bernard Harlow, who were willing to sacrifice their lives for our nation and for the greater good. And especially today, for me personally, it really reminds me of you know, where we are today and to really appreciate what we have today and where we are. And not forgetting about the lessons that we learned from history, especially during this time with many tensions and various corners of the world. And, you know, from the 75 years of peace since 1945, despite regional conflicts, it's a very precious time and important for economic cooperation and peaceful development, which is, I believe, something that is very important. for our generation to understand and focus on because war is, in my opinion, never the effective and the most productive way to resolve conflicts. And yeah, and also we, Mrs. McKay and I are able to go to Hawaii this summer, which fingers crossed will happen since it's already been postponed twice. And I think that it's really going to be a lifelong experience and a lifetime memory to be able to honor our servicemen, Lieutenant Barnard Harlow, at the Honolulu Memorial and be reading my eulogy and being able to honor, I guess, not only Lieutenant Bernard Harlow, but all of the servicemen from World War II is, yeah, really special. And I'm really honored to be here and be able to participate with this project along with Mrs. McKay. Thank you. Oh, and also, we are still in need of a picture of Lieutenant Harlow, I wanted to mention. So if anyone know any Harlows, you know, just being able to ask around and reach out. That's something that we're really hoping to find. Yeah, we want pictures of you on the Missouri. Oh, oh my gosh.\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"Hi, everyone. Well, this is a new one for all of us, so bear with me here. But first of all, thank you for letting me join in. And I want to let you know how very, very much we do appreciate our special educators. We appreciate all they do on a regular basis, but even right now, they are making a difference every day as we all try to adjust to the new normal. This report was written before the virus changed our education model, so it may not feel as relevant right now, but the recommendations are going to be key when we get back into the classroom, which hopefully will be sooner rather than later, and will help us with the continuing improvement of the ACPS special education model. Our first point was that we would really like to see Albemarle County implement the Safe Schools Ambassador Program. It's already in use in 41 states and over 2,000 schools to reduce bullying in the school systems. It's research-based. It's been field-tested. The process is they recruit students in grades four through 12. They look for the social leaders, the social influencers, and they train them in how to defuse, safely defuse a bullying situation. We know that students are present in the majority of bullying incidents, and this is their chance to step up and help often before teachers or administrators can even get to the scene. The study showed that the State Schools Ambassador Program decreases bullying and all the costs of the associated related suspensions. It increases attendance, it increases academic performance, it increases the respect for diversity, which goes on to our second point, diversity. The special education advisory committee members are requesting that special education be considered in the culturally responsive teaching initiative. Our students, many of them have a culture of their own. If you Google autism culture, you'll get multiple results on autism awareness and neurodiversity organizations. The deaf and hard of hearing have had a culture of their own recognized for decades. And even ADHD has a culture of its own. If you doubt that one, try attending their international conference and watch the attendees just come alive when they're surrounded by people who really understand them and who know what's going on in their world. They talk about overcoming challenges and they talk about adapting to their situations, but they also really celebrate their gifts. And folks with ADHD have a lot of gifts that often get missed in the typical classroom setting. Our third priority is to include the SPED community in the contemporary schooling initiative. We had a wonderful presentation on what's coming up with contemporary schooling, but it worried us a bit to know that Murray and the Community Public Charter School are moving away from the mastery learning and into a new IB program. Our students with some challenges are losing a valuable opportunity for learning there. That mastery model worked particularly well for a number of our students with some disabilities. If the SPED is included in the planning, we can make sure that all our students have a place in this new venture. It's exciting. We want to be involved. Our fourth priority is additional training for teachers and staff on ADHD and on the executive function challenges that come with it. We hear this from parents, from students, from teachers, from administrators, that our schools really need more training in this. It affects all students with or without disabilities. That part of the brain that regulates executive function doesn't fully come online until about age 25 and sometimes later. So all of our students would benefit. Also, our students would benefit as the teachers gain a little better control of the classroom. If you're not having to stop and work with those students who ADHD behaviors are disrupting learning, you get more time for teaching. And we're talking about approximately 11 percent of the students in our school system having ADHD. So every classroom is affected. Our final priority is ensuring that families get the information they need to work with the schools to help our students. Albemarle County Public Schools is leaving the Parent Resource Center, and a lot of us have counted on that resource. We want to be sure that we get a parent-centered, student-focused, and most importantly, impartial source of information. I have two special education students of my own, and the process was initially terrifying and a bit contentious even. Once I knew how the process worked, I understood the acronyms, I was able to develop the relationship with the teachers and the administration, the entire process changed. And I know for other parents, this process can go from frightening to uplifting when they know what's going on and how to work with the schools instead of feeling like we're working against them. As SEAC members, we hear this from a lot of parents frequently. The process is scary if you're not used to it and the acronyms are confusing. That's the end of the presentation part. I do really want to say thank you so much to Kevin Kirst and Katie Kompel and the entire special education team for their exceptional support of our students and especially during this incredibly challenging time. Thank you to the school board for letting me present this evening.\"},\n",

In short, just to keep new board members up to date on what we're doing, the VSBA puts together a packet of legislative proposals, which are basically things that they go and lobby the legislature for, the state legislature. The proposals are submitted by various counties and localities, and then they put together a list. It's very brief this year. I welcome you to look over it. If you have anything you want me to say when we vote on these, I'm happy to do so. Nothing seemed particularly contentious. There was only one proposal that had one dissenting vote. So they're all vetted. They're all vetted before they come to us to look at. There's only one dissenting vote in the whole packet. And that was about having behavioral interventionists as a standard of quality position, which would open up some funding sources for getting basically more mental health counselors and helpers into our schools. If I'm assuming we won't have any issue with this. So then when I go to the VSPA delegate assembly meeting, which is occurring on Monday, I will just vote yes. And then they will, the VSPA will use its lobbying arm to push these proposals and hopefully get some of them passed. It usually is a long process that takes a little bit of time. It usually kind of you propose something and then you propose the next year and eventually maybe something happens. So yeah, if we're all in agreement, then that's all I need is the support of the board to vote yes for the VSBA to lobby for these proposals. I will say real quick, just one thing that, and Dave, you did this last year, right? One thing that kind of shocked me the first go around was just that the positions don't all necessarily align exactly with what we want to do as a school board, because mainly the VSBA is just advocating for local autonomy. So it's really just about the ability for school boards to make their own decisions. So how do you guys feel about it?\"},\n",

Next Wednesday, Judy and I are meeting with Rosalind to try and put together a list of ideas for work sessions in the next year and possibly, you know, beyond that. and so I would ask any and all of the board members if you would please send us your ideas and maybe copy both of us on it so we both are seeing it at the same time and keep the same list for what you would like to see and I know we've talked about this a little bit in the past and Kate you and I have talked about these a number of times But if you could just kind of start it from scratch and just send us your ideas before next, let's say the end of next Tuesday, because we meet on Wednesday, that sure would be great. And I think that gives us a great starting place. And we've got a few ideas between us as well. So if you would, please. That's it. OK, thank you.\"}]},\n",

How would we do this without following something similar to the middle school folks?

       "    'content': \"I have a quick comment, which is going to be hard to follow because, Nick, you are doing a great job. I think it's fantastic that our overall suspension numbers have gone down, but I do think it's worth noting that if you go a slide back from this one, or maybe two slides back, the ratios for Actually, you can stay on the slide you're on. The ratios are, in essence, almost the same for black students. Can you go back actually to the one we were just on? And it's actually increased for our Hispanic students, increased for our multiracial students. So if you actually look at our minorities, we've actually, since it's decreased for our white population, presumably it's overall increased for our minorities. And so I guess while still being very appreciative of the fact that we overall are suspending less students, which I think is important across the board, I am curious, given that we put a focus on getting rid of the disparity the racial disparity, and perhaps it also falls along economic lines, I don't know, how are we going to address that in the future so it's changing? Because I would say the trend is actually the reverse of what we wanted to happen in terms of the disparity in the ratio, even though the overall number is coming down.\"},\n",
       "   {'role': 'Speaker_26',\n",
       "    'content': \"So the first thing I'd say is that one of the things that we did this year that I think had a pretty significant impact on the reduction in terms of suspensions for Black students is the Implementation of the Superintendent's Out-of-School Suspension Case Review Protocol. We use that protocol exclusively for Black students this year. Administrators weren't required to do it for other students. Just today, I completed the revision of policy JGB, which is the board policy that regulates out of school suspension. And we actually wrote into that policy the use of that protocol for all suspensions beginning next year. And so I anticipate that as we continue to implement STEP across the division and as we move forward with the superintendent's suspension review, case review protocol, we will see suspensions continue to reduce and see them continue to reduce across all student groups. One of the things that's important to think about, and I talked with Dr. Haas about this the other day, or actually someone else. The wonderful thing about that protocol is that what it does is that it reinforces for our administrators the notion that as a school division, we're going to support them when they decide to be creative about the way they respond to student behavior in ways that don't include out-of-school suspension. And so that is something that becomes particularly important and particularly useful. I can tell you that there are oftentimes when, you know, I have conversations with the administrators who would like to not suspend the student, but are concerned that it's not going to be well received if they don't suspend the student for a specific incident. And what this protocol allows us to do is to help them get comfortable with the notion that they can actually safely keep students in school and make sure that everyone else around them is safe. And once administrators get in that place, they are certainly less likely to impose suspensions and actually look for additional opportunities to reduce those suspensions. So I'm confident and optimistic that as we go forward, With the use of that tool and the step tool, we'll continue to see significant reductions. So in a couple of weeks, you will receive that policy revision, and I trust that you all will approve it. And we'll be ready to implement that in the fall and hopefully begin to see additional reductions in our suspension rates.\"},\n",
       "   {'role': 'Speaker_5',\n",
       "    'content': \"So that I can better understand that. So you're saying a policy we had put in place last year to help eliminate the disparity, the proportional disparity of who we suspend was only implemented with our black students and that now it's implemented with Hispanic and multiracial so that overall we're not disproportionately suspending minorities at a rate we don't approve of.\"},\n",
       "   {'role': 'Speaker_26',\n",
       "    'content': \"Right, I guess we would say we ran a pilot this year, wasn't put into policy this year. We ran a pilot with its use this year. So we used it as a practice this year. But in revising the policy that relates to suspensions, we have actually placed it in policy for next year. So I think the response to your question is that that's correct.\"},\n",
       "   {'role': 'Speaker_13',\n",
       "    'content': \"And I would add that the goal that we set that I put in front of the school board, because we knew as the overall suspension number was going to be reduced, it would make the percentage for minority students grow. So what we said, the whole goal is not there. In other words, we said that we were going to reduce the number of suspensions for Black students in particular by 20. And as of February, it was by 30. So because the overall number comes down, as you can see, the percentage doesn't go down as much as it could. And I like Ms. Colson's question because it really, the real work So on one level we've done, I think we've done some heavy lifting because we're trying to control the actual suspension decision of the administrator at the school. The deeper work is going to be drilling down and really be looking for patterns in teacher referrals and staff referrals. Because the issue is once the referral is written and once the incident happens or it's interpreted as to happen, then the referral is written and then all of a sudden it lands in the principal's office and then the principal has to do something with it. What we want to be able to do is to start looking for patterns in our teachers and the numbers of referrals that they write, the numbers of referrals that they write disparately impacting minority students. And then working with those staff members with professional development so that they can become more culturally responsive and less punitive in their work with the students. And the piece that Nick talked about earlier where he worked with Mark Leach to develop an electronic discipline referral, that's really the key because we're developing dashboards now that'll be coming to the board pretty soon. Sarah Dusenberry's working on those. And right now we're still using suspensions as a climate aspect of the dashboard for a school. And again, that's after the referral's already written. And so there's that whole layer underneath it that we need to tap into and expose and put in front of the board and start to get strategic about how do we work with the classroom teachers.\"},\n",

And so there is a disparity in there and a gap that leads not just to the salaries, but to other issues. And with us having a rural aspect to it, that has to have a factor in there. And I think their city council is not timid when it comes to raising taxes in order to pay for things both in the city and in the schools. That's not a criticism of the Board of Supervisors.

When I've been reviewing the last two years, particularly three years, we're talking singular students, whereas before it felt quite honestly, like overwhelming, right? Like 30 children in a group, how do you, you can't just go and find them not eligible, right? You can't kick kids out of special ed. So, but now we're getting to like singletons and it is incremental because that's the challenge is you can't just go out there and go, you know, you child, I have to knock you off the rolls because you're, you're of a minority, it doesn't work that way. It goes into practices, and we've been addressing that head on through other means, not just RTO. As early as the first semester this year, we've been working on methodology, especially with speech and language pathologists, because one of the group were children of Hispanic groups being found eligible for speech and language impairments. So we were looking at our practices of identification for speech and language impairments and brought someone in from John. Oh, I don't want to say because I just went blank in my brain. The teacher university down in New York City brought her up to do training on dynamic assessment. And the same with school psychologists, looking at best practices with identification and working with teams. So we are looking at spreading out that issue, working with particular schools as well. So yeah, it's not all eggs in one basket, as much as trying to diversify where our efforts are. But it's coming close. It really is in Singleton type children. We get our reports each year from the Department of Ed.

And whereas principals serve as educational leaders responsible for managing the policies, regulations and procedures necessary to ensure a safe and effective learning environment for all students in Virginia's public and private schools. And whereas principals and teachers are entrusted with the opportunity and the responsibility of guiding, directing, nurturing, mentoring, and imparting knowledge to our children while they are at school. And whereas principals must work collaboratively with teachers, staff, students, parents, and the community at large to proactively prepare students to be self-reliant and productive citizens. and whereas Virginia School Principals Appreciation Week is an opportunity to recognize the hard work of Virginia schools principals and to recognize the importance of principals in ensuring that every child has access to a quality education. Now, therefore, I, Ralph S. Northam, do hereby recognize January the 8th through 14th, 2022 as Virginia School Principal Appreciation Week in our Commonwealth of Virginia.

Tonight, we are truly honored to have with us Mrs. Lucille Smith, who recently completed unforgettable and extensive history of Jackson P. Burleigh High School. Last year, the school was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In her preface, Ms. Smith wrote, Black History Matters. We must continue to document and preserve the rich and brave story of African-American students in Charlottesville City and Atmau County. Before readers open the book's first pages, Ms. Smith advises them that the interviews from students, faculty, and administrators are raw, candid, and from the heart. Her connections to segregated education includes her husband Rizal, who graduated from Burleigh High School in 1966. Rizal later served as chair of the Charlottesville City School Board. Ms. Smith grew up and attended school in North Little Rock, Arkansas, across the river from Little Rock Central High School, a place forever known for its role in bringing into national public consciousness the struggle for racial educational opportunity. unforgettable, the history of Burleigh is not a volume though about separate and unequal education in our community. It is instead a joyous celebration of remarkable young men and women whose time at Burleigh comes back in pages filled with personal reflections, copies of original documents and photos, and a long list of extraordinary achievements. It recounts a story that should be told again and again of how education teaches us perseverance, pride, and confidence, friendship, and the value of just plain hard work, and how together all of these gifts build strong families and careers and selfless and uplifting community service. Although she did not have the opportunity to attend Burleigh, the considerable talents of Ms. Smith as a historian and writer would convince you otherwise. She served for more than 30 years with the U.S. Army National Ground Intelligence Center. She now devotes much of her time as a volunteer to local boards and community organizations and to her church. I understand that our school division will be making copies of Unforgettable available to all of our schools, to all of our school libraries. I'd like to formally introduce you to Lucille Smith and ask our guest to share with us some thoughts about her important contribution to learning for all students in our school division.

       "    'content': \"Good evening and thank you Chairman Page for the introduction. Mr Jeremiah, thank you for the opportunity to speak about Unforgettable Jackson Peak Early High School. Dr Haas and Dr Dunn. were very kind in allowing me to visit the county office building and go through old school board meeting minutes, which really assisted me with my research. I began volunteering with the Burley Varsity Club in 2011, and I became very intrigued with Burley High School. And I kept hinting, this great history needs to be documented. It did not happen. So I took the challenge and I decided to write the book because it has been more than 70 plus years since the school opened in 1951 and there has not been a publication or an official history written about the school. And many of the students No, all of the students are now senior citizens, and many of them are no longer with us. And the book tells some of the history of the school. There's just so much that you could write about. And there's the three area high schools. There's a highlight of those, Jefferson High School in the city and Albemarle Training School and Esmond High School in the county that united to become Jackson v. Burleigh High School. There are wonderful interviews from students, faculty, and administrators. And what was so important to me is that there is a picture of every faculty member, all of the administration that was there from 1951 through desegregation and the closing of the school in 1967. There is a timeline of the building of the school as well as an architectural description of the school. And there's many pictures of the organizations and the sports teams. Imagine for the first time, two jurisdictions, the city of Charlottesville and Albemarle County working together to build, own and shortly operate a school. My project began in 2020, right at the height of the pandemic. So it was really hard to get into UVA Special Collections Library, Library of Virginia, the Historical Society. So it took 18 months from the beginning of my research until the publication of the book. But I did have the opportunity to interview via telephone students and faculty, which was wonderful and what I'm stressing is that it is so important when writing history. to pull in segments of oral recollections. That was what really wowed me. That's so important. And working with the Burleigh Varsity Club, we could only locate about 17 of the remaining Falcuti. It's not that many more that remains anyway, but I was able to interview 13 of them and get some wonderful interviews. And I guess one of the most amazing things about that I learned about the community is that doing a very tumultuous time the parents fought so hard for their children to have a better education, so they partnered with the city and the county and for the first time working together. they began to erase that unequal educational system that was there at the time, and slowly it proved to be very fruitful. And through my research, some of the most important things that I learned, they were absolutely amazing, is that the land owned by Mr. Burley was acquired by eminent domain. The African American students from green county attended burley high school because they did not have access to a high school in their county. There were some students there from nelson county and I learned that African American students would only get an education through the 11th grade until burley open. in 1951 and I think one of the most amazing things and I just really delighted about that is I had the opportunity to reach out to Mr burley's granddaughter. Dr Olivia box and she and I have continued to keep in touch she lives in Atlanta now and that has been wonderful. with her talking about her family, but what I would like to stress is now is the time to document preserve and never forget the past. As we begin to secure the future by writing our histories and being an advocate and making sure that others are doing the same. The city of Charlottesville and Albemarle County are just rich in history and they have done an amazing job of preservation, and I think that is wonderful. So thank you for allowing me the opportunity to write about one of your schools. That's a great preservation. And your dedication to public education is absolutely outstanding because it is shaping the lives of our children and preparing them for a brighter future. And one of my last thoughts because Your Chairman Page had already mentioned about the Burley being on the Virginia Historic Landmark and being on the National Register of Historic Places. And that monument, that marker will be unveiled in April of this year on the grounds of the campus. And my last thought is placing copies of the book in all of the schools libraries will enhance discussions for students to talk about the schools of yesteryear. And what's so wonderful is that school is now Burleigh Middle School and it, you know, gets a lot of attention. It's been a wonderful school and you've taken really good care of it. You have wonderful students there and I love the administration over there. So thank you for allowing me to talk about my book tonight. And I hope that there's continued conversations and maybe at some point, some of these various students in the book that gave interviews can go over to some of the schools and the young people can ask questions about the days of yesteryear. Thank you so much for allowing me to discuss this. So I'll take any questions.\"},\n",

Some of the wind's been taken out of my sail now that I realize that there are still an outstanding 400 that have not gotten it. And according to the Thomas Jefferson Blue Ridge Health District, there should be at least that 10-day window plus from the first vaccination, but I still would encourage the school system to get students in as soon as possible. And I would like to also point out, I guess, since we, I don't want it to go with so little discussion, I wanna keep you guys all night, that I appreciate the work that our teachers are doing. I know a lot of our teachers have come and given comment and I hope that it's never, the message that we don't appreciate the work that they're doing. They're doing monumental work, they're changing things around, they're adjusting their schedules. I think we had a teacher drop off a bag of Valentine's Day party supplies at our front door.

I would support doing the full geothermal heating system, but I guess my pushback would be I don't want to be over budget. So what would be, what are, it's already a million something over, what kind of things would change to get into budget? And potentially 1.2 million or whatever it said under so that we could do the geothermal energy.\"},\n",

And as Kylan noted, one of the things we're going to do as we start the next process of continuing design is we're going to dive deeper into the amount of square footage we have in the building. It's right at 60,000, but we may be able to pull a couple hundred out here and there, change a few materials, something that would bring it back partially But I don't believe that we can pull out enough to get the full geothermal system into the project as a design, you know, part was a lot of part of a lot of that geothermal cost is drilling the wells. There is a payback of roughly around 16 and a half years on that. The hybrid system, we're using a really efficient mechanical system to begin with, so similar to what you're using on plenty of your other projects right now, this would be a system-wide a building-wide system, a very efficient mechanical system. But to get the full geothermal pieces into the project in the $20 million budget, I think we'd have to reduce the building square footage at this point a pretty good bit. Or dial maybe some site work back. We have 200 parking spaces on the site. There's an opportunity there potentially. But there's some things we could do to do that if we were given that direction. I just don't know if we could get all the way back to 20 million with the geothermal in there.\"},\n",

What environmental plan do we have in place when we speak to our, when we prioritize the sustainable measures that we want in a new building. Because new buildings are one of the prime opportunities we have to build sustainable, environmentally-friendly buildings. And that's something that we've aligned as a county and as a school board. So I always kind of feel like I just ask, well, what are you doing? And that seems like something that maybe we should have prioritized. Our follow-up is with the, I know we're making space for the solar panels, but do we have a plan? I know there's power purchase agreements. Do we have a plan to get solar on there? And I guess I'm just kind of curious the process on that.\"},\n",

And that includes, like Kyla mentioned, recycled materials, how you're laying out the site of the building, having a two-story building so we have a smaller footprint, making our mechanical system as efficient as it can be with whatever budget we have. Geothermal is kind of that next step forward, which does have a higher upfront cost. We got crozet. We got lucky because the cost increase for geothermal is offset by and increase we'd have to do with the electrical service. So it made, there was a much shorter payback with the Crozet scenario. Here, it's new construction. The design committee made, I think, a great decision in not bringing natural gas to the site, even though natural gas is available for the site. So we're doing that so we can, as the grid becomes cleaner, the energy serving the building will become cleaner. And then long-term for the solar power, for solar on the building, We talked about this a little bit too, the solar power purchase agreement is how we've done that at six of our schools. At Henley, we were able to get solar on the building through a grant opportunity, but solar PPAs are a great strategy for us to do that in the future here. Thank you.\"},\n",

And that's getting candid feedback from students, initially in the high schools and eventually getting it into middle schools and potentially on from there. Early in the summer, I met, not in person, but I met a young woman who is a junior at Albemarle High School. Her name is Ella Vessel, and she started a club this school year. She'd been talking to me about it and hadn't gotten all the bylaws done and was going into a school fair to try and get members to work with her on it. And she's got 10 or 12 and so this is a real team and it's really now beautifully set up. It's called Albemarle Student Voice and it revolves around issues from county and school board division policies and how it affects students in their day-to-day experiences. Albemarle Student Voice uses Instagram to poll local students about these policies and give students a voice to provide feedback and insights to both the Board of Supervisors and the School Board. While Albemarle Student Voice is only active at AHS, Albemarle High School right now, Ella hopes to represent student voices at Monticello and Western Albemarle before the end of the year. It's her goal that Albemarle Student Voice will be a reference, a big part, and a resource for both students and our community leaders to better understand each other's strategies and positions and to create a more open community. She's a very impressive young woman and this is along the lines of what we were looking at in terms of getting more feedback. I know that Melanie has been working with Dr. McLaughlin on some surveys and some other means to solicit information from students. And ASV has currently pulled students online about the online school year and is looking to share their findings with us and with the Board of Supervisors. They're just in the process of compiling those data and getting it into a form that they could send to us, present to us, however that would work. They would also, and this is the part where I think we could actually help them, is they would welcome receiving any suggestions from the board that we would like to ask students about in their surveys. So the bottom line is, and I'm keeping mine under 25 minutes too, but I sure didn't want to give Ella a short shrift on this. I applaud her and her team and look forward to hearing further from them So if you get an email or emails or some sort of communication from Albemarle Student Voice, please open it and check it out. And she's one of these people who would really welcome a lot of feedback, a lot of fatiguing, and a lot of the wisdom that I think we could share with her. So that's all I have.\"}]},\n",

I will state for the record, and the minutes of this meeting should so reflect, that the meeting is being held electronically pursuant to Virginia state law and Albemarle County ordinance. because the COVID-19 pandemic makes it impracticable and unsafe to assemble a quorum physically in a single location. The meeting is being streamed live on the Albemarle County Public Schools website and public comment may be offered through the Zoom waiting feature in accordance with the school board's protocol or by written submission. I'd also like to say for anybody listening in who is looking at an older agenda, item 2.2 has been moved to the second meeting, which would be a week from tomorrow, of the school board retreat. Ms. Schmidt is going to be meeting with some of the people involved in that particular issue. We would like to incorporate that into the presentation to the board. And I just want to read one statement that I think is highly important. Tomorrow, June 19, is the oldest national celebration of the ending of slavery in the United States. On that day in 1865, A general order was read to the people of the last slave-holding state in the Union in Texas, which said in part, all slaves are now free. The order proclaimed that this action involved the absolute equality of rights between former slaves and their owners. History has sadly not agreed. Over the past 155 years, slavery's disgraceful legacy separated those rights, consistently destroying lives and families and causing incalculable damage to our nation. It is still doing those awful things today. Public schools were not established for such purposes. They were established to be the place where all children would receive equal opportunities to be safe and cared for and to learn and develop at their highest potential. We are not yet such a place. Earlier this week, Governor Northam said, slavery is not just the history of our black communities, this is everyone's shared history. Our anti-racism policy promises, quote, we are committed to establishing and sustaining an equitable community that achieves the school division's equity mission to end the predictive value of race and ensure the success of each individual student and staff member. To appropriately embrace this unity of purpose, It is imperative that our school division join the state and our country, and our county, rather, in designating June 19, Juneteenth, as a time of personal reflection and renewed commitment to racial justice and equality for all. A day that stands in tall fulfillment of the four values of our school division, to serve all of our students all of the time, to partner with members of our community, to respect all, and to achieve excellence in our relationships with all. It is appropriate to celebrate that which is the true place of public education in our communities and in our nation. And so I call upon my colleagues on the board to approve effective immediately that every June 19 will be a day of honor. a day of personal reflection and renewed commitment to equal opportunity and justice for all, and be set aside as a paid holiday for all school division employees. May I have a motion, if someone is comfortable, to approve this? I move that we approve the statement, placing the Juneteenth statement, placing our county in line with county and state guidelines as outlined by Governor Northam.\"}]},\n",

In establishing this role, our goal was to enhance the quality and effectiveness of decisions that directly impact students and their futures. We especially wanted to provide a direct link with students. You were that link. We especially valued your insight and counsel on such important decisions as the banning of hate images in schools, providing a safe and welcoming learning environment for all students, and the classroom challenges presented by the pandemic. In our policy, we said we wanted a student representative of exemplary character with high personal standards of conduct, a student who modeled the fulfillment of school policies and regulations, and a leader interested in school board governance.

I feel very strongly about the fact that we have an opportunity, and this is in light of what many people talked about and going back to what Kate and I have been talking about for the last three or four years, of setting up a new model for our relationship with the police department. And one of the big issues for me is educational disruption, the environmental disruption for students who feel negatively about an officer being present at school. I'm totally fine with that removal. And I do know that we're going to need to have some sort of a relationship with the police department. We have football games that they're at. There are other events that they are at. But we can do a new model, and that's very much in our hands to do. And that gets into independent reviews. That is in our hands to ultimately decide. And so I think we should be going down that path. Accountability is one that I believe in too. And while there is a lot of good content in the current MOU, the draft MOU, there's a lot that can be taken out if they're no longer on campus. There are a lot of things that could be molded in that, but we've got to have some sort of a working relationship with them, and that is really going to include an MOU. We have to get the data, not only from the schools, but from other sources as well, so we can make an informed decision. And I do encourage all of us to come in with an open mind on it.

I would like to give my two cents as a representative of the driver's education program, as well the extended day enrichment program, both of which will be affected by this decision, if you all care to hear my position. Please. I would like to. Thank you. Thank you very much. Well, I have not been a supporter of the program from the beginning, just because it has been one that I have observed with political influences. That was in the best interest of an organization without strong consideration of what is in the best interest long term long term not short term, but long term for our students and families. So, you know, Our objective as a school division is to improve the quality of life for all of our students. And so when we talk about a child care service that's inexpensive, it's like low or no cost for our low income families, what are we doing to address the core of the problem as to why they are low income families? And it boils down to the fact that we have miseducated the parents of the children that we're trying to serve right now. So what are we doing in terms of asking the right questions to make sure that we're not continuing to increase the economic disparities that we have by creating another program? Sure, this program will provide childcare service. Then you have to ask the question, should Albemarle County Public Schools be committed to childcare services? Now, also when we, We talk about replacing or relocating the driver's education range. We certainly should not make a decision today without determining the cost of a driver's education program and as to whether or not we can afford a new driver's education, replacing a driver's education program before we make this decision. So I think that we have to be very careful when we make these decisions. simply because we're all about long term impact. And, you know, we are looking at a lot of mistakes that we've made historically, and sometimes we repeat decisions by just considering how we made decisions in the past. Have we really thought about what we're trying to change in terms of serving some of our low-income families? Have we looked at how many of these children are latchkey kids, or whether or not their parents really need to service? So there are a lot of questions that were presented that were not asked. And I'm just encouraging you all not to jump into making a decision right away, such as removing our driver's education program, considering a new up-to-date facility without understanding the cost, a deadline, and all of those things before we jump into this decision?\"},\n",

There is no need to replace the driving range. I think that it would not be in the best interest of our taxpayers to move forward with a program that is not the standard program throughout Virginia and is absolutely not necessary with the modern technology that is available in our cars today. Perhaps during a time when there wasn't any kind of safety measures in cars, including not a requirement to wear seatbelts when that driving range was built, we no longer need such a, actually kind of a primitive facility to be used to teach our students to drive. say that capital dollars need to be spent in some other way. Dr. Hairston was part of the RFP process all the way through. We had him to be part of that. I think his voice has been heard loud and clear, well above all the data that absolutely suggests, not only suggests, but encourages us to have a high quality afterschool program right smack in the northern feeder pattern in the urban ring where we do not have one. So also there was extensive data around the EDEP program to suggest that it does not serve our most needy children. It is a very expensive program and only recently have we begun to adopt measures to use a lottery for that program. And we were looking to expand enrollment in that program this year, but we can't do that because we don't have the funding to do that. The Boys and Girls Club will be able to do that probably sooner than we will be able to, and they will, in my opinion, be much more welcoming and open to having those students than we have with our own program. I don't want to refute one of my staff members in a board meeting. However, we have put plenty of data in front of the board to show that that driving range is not necessary, but a high-quality afterschool program that's affordable for our children in the northern feeder pattern is very essential. And again, as the superintendent, I would also say that Rosalind Schmidt did speak to Dr. Harrison about this change in facilities, I believe last week or the week before, so that he would have time to share that with his staff in the driver's ed program.\"},\n",

Here's a summary of what we presented in the draft funding request as changes from the fiscal year 21 adopted budget. You can see the four categories that we have, and we'll talk about each of these in a little bit more detail. The total changes in the draft funding request in this category are $7.7 million. We'll first review the part-time health insurance spending proposal. Currently, part-time employees who are less than 0.5 FTEs do not receive health insurance benefits from the county. However, part-time employees who are between 0.5 and 0.69 currently receive prorated health insurance benefits. For example, if you are a 0.5 half-time FTE, you pay the employee premium that a full-time employee pays, but in addition, you're also paying 50% of the employer's contribution. This may be over $4,000 per year, the additional piece. The proposal recommends a change that all part-time employees who are between 0.5 and 0.69 receive benefits at the same rate as a 0.7 FTE. So in our 0.5 FTE example, their share of the employer contribution would now be 30% or about $2,400. Compared to the original 50% burden they had before of 4,000, they would see savings of about $1,600 per year. This banding methodology lines up well with our current banding of 0.7 to 1 FTEs. A technical adjustment in this proposal is that we would like to expand the proposal to include same benefits for our dental insurance plans as well as our medical. Are there any questions on this one? I'll now turn the presentation over to Ms. Dana Robb to discuss our minimum pay rate proposal.\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"Thank you. Good evening. I'm Dana Rob, the program manager for compensation rewards. And this afternoon I will be reviewing our recommendation regarding increasing to the $15 minimum for our school division employees. As you may recall last year, we were poised to move ahead increasing our minimum full-time pay rate to $15 an hour. That was paused due to the pandemic. And we are now bringing this forward for consideration for the upcoming year. The school division has about 18% of employees that are currently making less than the $15 an hour, $15 per hour. These are employees whose positions are in the lower pay grades, such as our custodians, our teaching assistants, and ADP assistants, for example.\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"Our recommended strategy for raising our minimum pay rate includes raising both our VRS and non VRS scale in order to bring the VRS scale to a minimum of $15 an hour. Our goal is to increase all employees to a $15 minimum hour pay rate in future phases. And we are looking at a decompression model that uses a banding strategy that avoids leapfrogging and improves communication to employees. We feel that moving our full timers to $15 an hour first is the best approach. The estimated cost for this strategy is approximately $2.8 million. In changing both pay scales to reflect the $15 minimum on the full-time VRS scale, we also have to decompress. So this cost, we're working through our decompression strategy to make sure that we are addressing and avoiding leapfrogging concerns and making sure that we are impacting the employees that we wish to, which are in the lower pay grades. Next slide, please. This slide helps illustrate the complexity of compression and why we want to be thoughtful in our methodology to address it. On this graph, you will see that there are employees that are currently making between $10 an hour and $20 an hour in the school division. All of these employees will need to be brought to the $15 minimum. For instance, you have an employee who makes a little bit above $10 an hour, and has one year of experience. An employee who is almost at $14 an hour and has almost 20 years of experience. This is why addressing compression is so important, because we're bringing both of these employees to 15, but then we will apply the compression model remedy to preserve some of the equity between these employees. Next slide. To solve the compression, we are applying a decompression methodology that utilizes what we call a banding or tiered structure. This means that we are creating tiers in which pay rates are banded together and moved to a new pay rate. An example is in the slide, employees that are making between $10 an hour and $11 an hour are moved to 15. Employees from $11.01 an hour to $12 an hour moved to 15.10. Please keep in mind, these are just examples. We are still working through the exact strategy, and we may have more tiers, of course, than what is illustrated right here. There are pros and cons to this strategy. The pros, it does avoid leapfrogging. We do not want to leapfrog employees. We want to make sure that we are placing employees appropriately and not excavating leapfrogging. It is easy to communicate to employees. There will be a table that employees can take a look at. It will show them what the range is, and then they will see that they'll go to Whatever the designated pay rate will be for that for that group of employees. And we make sure that this is targeting the right group of employees. So this will be for the employees, as we said before, that are in those lower pay grades. And this allows for a flexible structure and approach. So we, as we are working through the cons of this strategy, that it does arose some equity relationships between employees that are both experience related and performance related, and it can create possible hiring challenges. This flexible approach lets us work with those tiers to make sure that we can minimize those cons with a strategy. These are examples of employees that will be affected by moving to $15 an hour on the VRS scale and moving to also moving the non-VRS scale. So we're moving both scales and we will be impacting both full-time and part-time employees. And the application of the decompression strategy will impact teaching assistants, office associates, employees in building services and child nutrition, EDEP employees and transportation employees. We want to take just a minute to also explain what the difference is between the VRS pay scale and non-VRS pay scale. So for our VRS pay scale, those are our full-time employees. They have a mandatory 5% contribution that comes out of their salary and goes into VRS. With this pay scale, our minimum currently is $10.20 an hour. Our proposed minimum pay rate for this pay scale will be moved to $15. That's a 50% lift. On our non-VRS pay scale, part-time, this is a part-time pay scale. It starts at 972 currently, and it will move to 1429. So that's still a pretty significant lift for these employees. The last row on this slide just shows that with the $15 an hour and also moving the non-VRA scale to 1429 an hour, with a 2% pay raise, these employees will be moved even further into the pay scales. So for a $15 minimum, they'll be moved to 1530 as an example. For 1429, they'll be moved to 1457. You can go to the next slide. Are there any questions about the minimum pay rate strategy as I've explained it?\"},\n",

And normally in this month, we have two meetings. And we have two meetings next month instead of the normal one that we have in July. And I'm just very appreciative of that.

They all have full-time jobs during the days. and with a heck of a lot going on and moving on right now, but also moving forward through unchartered territories. So I thank you one and all for your work, your patience and your unswerving devotion to what it is that you do. I also wanna take a minute because I did not introduce another member of our group last week. And that was, I think, because Allison Linney is like family to us. And so we all know her, but I realized that not everybody in the viewing public will know who she is. So Allison is the president and founder of Allison Partners, a consulting firm that's founded with the belief that people are at the core of an organization's success and is based here in Charlottesville. Ms. Linney has an MBA from the Darden Graduate School of Business at the University of Virginia, and she has worked with government and academic agencies, large public and private healthcare systems, large multi-specialty groups, small group practices, HMOs, providers of healthcare information systems, and occupational medicine services, as well as free health clinics And she has worked with us and been an important part of our processes over the last five years that I've been on the board. I'm not sure how long you were doing it before, Allison. She was selected as the 2018 Charlotte's fit. Come on. I'm going to do this. Nobody needs to know all this. One last thing, because this one's important too. She was selected as a 2018 Charlottesville Regional Chamber of Commerce Small Business Person of the Year and serves on a variety of University of Virginia boards and community organizations. So Allison, we're very glad that you're here and now everybody knows who you are. And she's got a cool lightsaber. So moving on with our first order of business, we need to approve our agenda.

       "    'content': \"Good evening. My name is Maya Kumazawa, Director of Budget and Planning, and I will be facilitating the work sessions for the development of the FY22 budget. Tonight, I'll be sharing with you the technical details behind the draft funding request that Dr. Haas presented earlier this evening. I first want to acknowledge Stephanie Clark, Senior Budget Analyst, who continues to work tirelessly to cost out and build this funding request. Thank you, Stephanie. Here's an overview of the various pieces of the draft funding request that will be covered throughout our work sessions. Today's work session number one will focus on the assumptions or inputs going into the funding request, including revenue and enrollment assumptions. Over the next couple of weeks, we plan on covering the expenditures and the draft funding request in more detail, as you can see in this outline. After you've had some time to review the budget document, if you all have any questions about any topic, please feel free to submit them at any time, and we will do our best to incorporate the information in future work sessions, like some of the questions we received around the minimum pay rate. We will also submit written responses to any questions posed by our board members in between work sessions and post them to the website for the public to see as well. Here's our agenda for today. As I mentioned, we'll go over FY22 budget assumptions. Mr. Kirst and Ms. Kastner will present detailed information about our special populations towards the end. After each section is presented, that's on the agenda, I will pause for questions and discussion as needed. Does that work for everyone? And are there any questions up to this point? All right. Without further ado, I will jump into our revenue assumptions. As you can see in the pie chart, we receive our revenues from two primary sources, local and state. The local revenues portion mostly represents the transfer from local government. But there are some other revenues that we generate as a school division that is included. The recurring revenue outlook is positive and our conservative approach to the current fiscal year puts us in a favorable position going into next. We have two primary drivers of the local revenue change. We're currently budgeting for an almost $7 million increase in the local government transfer. This is slightly offset by a decrease in local school revenues of $175,000. Revenues for school building rentals are projected to decrease as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and continued uncertainty regarding building needs. As a reminder, Albemarle County shares 60% of the increase or decrease in available shared local tax revenues with the school division. The majority of local tax revenues are general property taxes. This transfer is increasing as a result of higher real estate assessments and other local tax revenues that to date have been impacted less than anticipated due to the pandemic. I won't spend any more time on this slide since you've seen it already today. I'll now move on to the primary drivers of our state revenue changes. The structure of state revenues and FY22 will differ significantly from previous years, and I'll attempt to highlight them over the next few slides. This is a summary table of the high-level changes that are impacting our state revenues projection. Basic aid and sales tax are expected to increase slightly together as a group. On the next slide, I'll explain why these items are shown together. Funding that applies enrollment projections are declining. However, these declines are offset by no loss funding of $2.9 million in FY22. And finally, we're incorporating in some state funds to support teacher compensation. In the state's proposed budget, the $546,000 represents funding for a 2% bonus for SOT positions. We would still see this funding if we did something different, such as the raise that we've proposed in the budget. The 2% bonus is a minimum requirement. This line chart illustrates how the state revenues reflect both decreasing enrollment and no loss funding. The blue line at the top represents pre-pandemic state projections for our school division. The orange line on the bottom represents revised state projections due to the pandemic. The FY21 state revenues were developed using the FY21 pre-pandemic projections. The FY22 state revenues are developed using the FY22 revised projection. This is the change in budget-to-budget enrollment, and this decrease is reflected across various SOQ funding and other programs. However, the state has proposed a no-loss funding amount to make us whole to the original FY22 projection. In the budget book, you'll see this as a lump sum under incentive programs. Moving on to sales tax. Walden Cooper projects the school age population for Albemarle County each year in order to distribute sales and use tax among the school divisions of 1.125%. These taxes are distributed to Virginia's 135 school divisions. Here's a glimpse of historical sales tax trends. The blue columns represent total Virginia taxable sales and the orange columns represent ACPS sales tax revenues. You can see that both amounts peaked around FY20, dip in FY21, and are beginning to increase again in FY22. We're anticipating a significant budget-to-budget increase in sales tax in FY22. Due to the economic uncertainty we were in last spring, our budgeted sales tax revenues were very conservative, and we now know that we will be seeing higher than anticipated revenues in this area. I also show here the basic aid formula so you can see how sales tax is incorporated into the funding. While basic aid is driven by the per-pupil funding amount, the enrollment projection, and LCI, an increase in sales tax will have an opposite effect in basic aid. When we combine both declining enrollment and increasing sales tax, you'll see a decline in basic aid funding overall. However, when you combine these two pieces together, sales tax and basic aid, you can see that the declining enrollment is more than offset, and we are expecting an increase in this category. The final piece of revenue information I plan on going over is our one-time budgeted use of fund balance. Here's a partial snapshot of FY21. This is the FY21 adopted budget compared to our FY21 projected budget, so a revised budget. We anticipate a savings of about $4.9 million in the current year, and we're proposing to bring this forward into FY22 as part of the proposed budget, the total budget. This amount represents one-time funds in addition to the $12 million increase in recurring funding. During the third work session, we will discuss the different uses for these funds. What's not included here is one-time funding from the Federal CARES Act. As we continue to develop our learning recovery plans, we will incorporate CARES Act funding into the budget later this spring. Are there any questions regarding our fiscal year 22 revenues?\"},\n",

Marie tribe of Chippewa Indians, and I'm speaking on behalf of my children. Native Americans have been the recipient of more abuse and false promises from the American government than any other culture in the 244 years of America's history. Forgive me if I am predisposed not to trust my children's welfare to the whims of the school board and administration empowered by that government. That being said, I'm not here to talk about masks or quarantine or any of the other issues plaguing our students because the governor and the attorney general have that well in hand and it won't be long until it's over. What I'd like to focus on tonight is get to the root of our local problem and propose that we recall the entire school board. You continue to refuse to meet with us in person, unlike most other Virginia counties, including Savannah, Culpeper, and Loudoun, to name a few. I am tired of all of you hiding behind your computer screens. We want the opportunity to encourage each other in person and to be able to look you in the face and know that you're actually listening to us. Don't mute me, there will be a quiz at the end and definitely a petition. You had no problem putting elderly at risk school bus drivers on the front lines in the fall of 2020 when you forced them to go out and deliver school lunches. They had no option to work from home and like all of you. Long before there was a vaccine and before we had a full understanding of the dangers being faced, you put them face to face with students. And yet you won't meet face to face with us with your vaccines, masks, face shields and social distancing. I was told by Phil that the school board doesn't have permission to use the county office building. Sure, okay. I understand that part may be out of your hands, but surely you can grant yourselves permission to use one of the school auditoriums if you really want to meet us in person, but you don't. I mean, if we can put 70 kids on a school bus, surely we can put 70 adults in an auditorium. And while we are at it, we can even magically reduce the COVID contact trace to three feet like they do on the buses. If you can change the rules to meet your needs, you can change them to accommodate your constituents. Apparently these meetings being zoom meetings multiplied attendance by the hundreds and that's wonderful. There's no reason to stop. But that is also no reason for you not to show up and do your job in person. You expect teachers, bus drivers and custodians to come to work every day. So I expect you to be at work one day a month where you're supposed to be there. I worked the entire pandemic, I never stopped. My husband and I delivered food to people like you were afraid to leave their homes, people sheltering in place. We didn't have the luxury to stay at home because we had to keep our business open so we could survive. The school board and administrators are no better than we are and they should have to go to work just like everybody else. Don't worry though, if we do succeed in replacing all of you, I heard the transportation department is desperately in need of school bus drivers. Thank you for listening and good night.\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"Thank you. I live in the Whitehall District, and I wanted to thank you for continuing to uphold the masking policy, given our current rate of community transmission. I was going to cite statistics about how relying on vaccinations as the primary mitigation strategy is inherently inequitable, given the fact that many people remain unvaccinated or under vaccinated for reasons that have nothing to do with choice. I can remind you that COVID-19 disproportionately impacts black, brown, immunocompromised, and low-income families and families without the ability to work remotely much more significantly than white or affluent families, families who aren't already dealing with significant health challenges, and families with flexible work options. In the absence of readily available and accessible testing opportunities, masking remains our most equitable mitigation strategy to limit the spread of COVID-19 and to keep schools open. To be clear, I share the urgency to return to normal. I recognize that declining mental health among children and teens is a major concern, but there are many factors that have contributed to student mental health decline and masks are not one of them. There's a loss of normalcy, yes, but also the literal loss of loved ones and family income disruption and loss of social interaction and endless anxiety over all the different ways COVID has or could impact their lives. There has been fear and not just fear of COVID. In our county, in one semester alone, there have been multiple social media threats that have led to lockdowns and arrests. That's traumatic for children and teens. active shooter drills, divisive politics, the existential threat to our democracy, world leaders' inability to take substantive action to combat the climate crisis, angry parents yelling at school board members or suing school divisions over a curriculum that includes fact-based history lessons and policies that make schools more inclusive of all students. What are we doing? Mask wearing is not the problem, and fear is not ruling our lives, but compassion should. We want our community to be healthy. We want our children to learn the truth. We want our kids to be safe. We want our kids to care about each other. And everyone wants our kids to be in school. So masking for now is a way to keep our schools open. And it's also how we show our neighbors and especially our healthcare workers that we care. It's literally the least we can do for each other. Thank you.\"},\n",

Over the summer months, they perform deep cleaning activities, which include floor refinishing, and cleaning all spaces from top to bottom. The summer cleaning checklist is simply one tool the custodians use to ensure the buildings are ready once the students and teachers arrive. Again, all spaces are cleaned from top to bottom. The custodians do incredible work. The Environmental Division has been very busy with the COVID pandemic response and preparation. They have created plans for physically distancing, procured and distributed COVID-19 supplies to all schools, and have installed COVID-19 related signage in all buildings. In addition to COVID-19 works, The environmental group was successful in bidding and securing a contractor to make improvements to the Stony Point well system and work with the Urbana Solid Waste Authority to infill the basin near the transportation department. Before and after shots here. Okay, now on to capital improvements. I want to begin by reminding you that the capital improvement maintenance program was not as robust this year budget cuts, about one third of the program had significant impacts on what we were able to accomplish. Reductions to the maintenance program were a result of the concerns related to COVID-19. Some of the cuts included casework replacement, locker removal, window and door upgrades, restroom upgrades, painting and flooring improvements. However, despite the cuts, we were able to make significant repairs to our facilities this year. At Albemarle High School, we were able to perform upgrades to the mechanical systems. We were able to replace two boilers, a chiller, the electrical switchgear, and two sewer pumps. All of these systems were 30 years old. The Vehicle Maintenance Facility had its HVAC system replaced. This system was also 30 years old, and the new system will improve efficiency and improve the air At Henley Middle School, we installed a new emergency generator. The generator not only improved the backup power for life safety systems, but also allow the phones and various kitchen equipment to remain operable in the time of a power outage. At Walton, we replaced the front office HVAC system with a high-efficiency VRF system, as well as replaced the chiller that serves the entire building. These changes will make the spaces more comfortable, more reliable, and more energy efficient. Jewett and Henley each received a new walk-in cooler and walk-in freezer to replace the aging obsolete equipment. Brownsville received a new kitchen exhaust hood and dishwasher room upgrades. In addition to the new dishwasher, the dishroom received a large pass-through window from the cafeteria to allow a more efficient collection of trays. We were able to renovate the kitchen serving area at Jewett, which included serving line improvements and a new security gate. The main objective here was to increase the efficiency of serving foods to the students. Walton, Woodbrook, and Albemarle High School received new roofs on a significant portion of each building. Over 124,000 square feet of roof was replaced, or approximately three acres. We modernized classroom spaces at both Walton and Jewett middle schools. At Jewett, we upgraded the CTE space. And at Walton, we updated six classrooms, including soundproofing between classrooms and providing natural light by installing skylights. Renovations to Western Albemarle High School shop were also completed this summer. Improvements included a new hot work area for forging and welding and renovations to the woodworking area that included a new dust collection system, new bay doors, new shop equipment, and electrical upgrades. A sixth classroom trailer was installed at Baker Butler, which included bathrooms, technology, security locks, and furniture. Mountain View received new signage on the building, at the road, and within the building. The Scottsville addition and renovation project is progressing well. This summer, we completed renovations to 12 classrooms, four bathrooms, and provided new furniture. The addition, which includes five classrooms and a gymnasium, is well underway. The rough site grading is complete, the building footers have been installed, and the structural steel is arriving next week. The Red Hill Classroom addition has started. This project includes a new 6,300 square foot gymnasium addition as well as renovating the existing gym into classroom space. Before I conclude, I'd like to acknowledge and thank not only the building services staff, but also the staff from the Department of Facilities Development for their help in the execution of these capital projects. We have a great partnership with them. And with that, I would just like to end with a big thank you for your support. And I'd be happy to answer any questions.\"},\n",

Because of the pandemic, we are required to read this statement into our minutes.

The meeting is being communicated to the public electronically through Zoom and streamed live on the Albemarle County Public Schools website. And public comment may be offered through the Zoom waiting room feature in accordance with the school board's protocol or by written submission. And also tonight we have another statement that we hope our listeners will be aware of and adhere to. I'd like to quote from a paragraph that is in our policy on school community relations. It says in part, the school board recognizes the public has vast resources of training and experience. And I add perspectives that are useful to schools. The strength of our school system is in the degree to which these resources are tapped in an advisory way. And these resources are involved in supporting the improvement of our educational program. Broad and diverse community engagement with the work of the board and the school division is so important that its value is expressly stated in the policy. Everyone is encouraged to offer their ideas, judgments, concerns, and questions about how well the school division is serving the needs of students and contributing to the health, safety, and economic prosperity of our community. The live streaming of school board meetings office of that valuable opportunity to benefit from the voices of more parents, students, employees and community partners. Since the pandemic participation in school board meetings often has gone from less than 25 people to more than 1000. We'd like to build on this growing community interest. Beginning this evening, those who accessed our live stream link will be offered a brief survey that will help us to expand our community outreach and contributions. Please take a few minutes to help with this goal. So if you are listening to our meeting, please take that opportunity at the end of the meeting, at the end of this session.

So that, for example, we have, Mr. Holden showed me a resolution that a board recently developed to make decision to alter their relationship with their police department. And what they did is they structured it as a resolution that provided their, you know how like when you make a resolution, it starts with the reasons for why you're doing what you're doing. And then also it provides a step-by-step understanding of how that relationship is going to be undone or redone, reconsidered, altered in some way. So it spells out the particulars of the change so that your constituents understand the change that you're making in pieces. And also the board has a clear understanding of what's changing and what's not changing and why that's occurring. So what we wanna do as we've done, I think we had a very successful budget process this year, although it ended with us going into a recession. But the reason I think it was successful was because we worked transparently and worked back and forth with the board to get to where you wanted to get in the decision-making process and it became very clear to everyone what the decision was gonna be. So we're hoping that by July 9th, that through the direction of the board, we'll be able to present a resolution to you that can be put in front of you by the chair, and then looking for a motion to support that resolution for the change. To me, it's like a breadcrumb trail. that you're laying out into your decision so that it's not just a yes or a no or not just we're gonna undo this, but we haven't really made any kind of considerations for what the undoing looks like or how it's gonna be structured.

We reached out to everyone in the community and said, tell us a little bit about your experience in being in school. and what you think are the right sizes, both in terms of minimum and maximum for our schools by level. We presented them with a little bit of information to begin with. So it showed them the average school size at the national level, at the Virginia State level, and then our school level, so that they could have a perspective on where would some boundaries potentially be. We then gave them a series of options to select from as their ideal minimum and ideal maximum. For the minimums, we tried to identify the point at which we were thinking about theoretically the smallest school in our division. And we were also kind of roughly matching the cut point for the Hold Harmless funding that Maya mentioned, because we would ideally not recommend schools go below that Hold Harmless level. At the maximum, we were looking at extending beyond where our largest schools were. We were also looking at extending beyond the scope of our current staffing standards. If we were to build schools that large, we would have to either reconsider our staffing standards or adjust our staffing models to accommodate schools that large. We also attempted to reduce the numerical gaps between any of the response options. to the extent possible, so that people could feel like they were choosing something close to where they honestly felt they were, as opposed to a large, you know, 500 student gap, which felt like they were just getting lost in the abyss. We tried to provide as many options as possible to reduce those options. Next. So for our survey, we had over 3,000 responses, nearly 3,100 responses, which is excellent for our community. The responses were largely by parents. We also had a very large response rate by students. We directly sent the survey out to students to try to solicit their feedback. We can look over on the right, we can see the demographic breakdowns for the race ethnicity. We can see we're kind of close in some of our groups, but we're maybe a little heavy on the white, a little light on that black and Hispanic, maybe a little heavy on the Asian as well. close to a good demographic representation, probably ideal considering real world circumstances and a lot of external factors that affect people's ability to participate in these kinds of surveys. So I would say overall, a very high quality representation of where our community is in terms of demographic representation. Next. So these are the results that we will present. For the minimum enrollment size, the community was pretty consistent and wanting somewhere between two and 350 students, which very tightly aligns with our minimum schools right now. When you look over on the left, you'll see a weighted score and a plurality score. The plurality score is whichever bar is the farthest to the right. The weighted score is using a weighted average of all of the scores. And so it's intended to give you a sense of, if you looked at the plurality and budged, which way would you want to budge? So for minimum, ideally, we would keep schools at 200. But if we had to go bigger as a minimum size, the community would support going a little bit bigger. It's also possible they'd support going smaller if we allow that option to be visible. But given our hold harmless staff, then we didn't allow that option visible. The maximum, you can see that the plurality was at 500 with the weighted at 510. So they're really tightly in agreement that about 500 is where they want to see elementary schools stop growing. And that's where the community largely has agreement about that decision. And so if the board were to present something in a policy around 500, there would be quite a bit of community support for that decision. Next. Middle schools were similarly in agreement. At the minimum, there was somewhere between three and 450 students, which is right in line with actually many of our middle schools. If you look at Walton, Lakeside, Jewett, Burley, they were all kind of in that range with Lakeside, Burley, and Jewett kind of extending past that range slightly. So we're very much in alignment with where we are as a school division. When you look at the maximum, they're looking at a cap of about 600. If you had to push up, there would be a little bit of community support for pushing up beyond 600, but not a lot, which would primarily impact schools like Henley, which is well in excess of 668 students. And the next. The high school, this is the one of the places that was the most interesting data point that we received. So the minimum was exceptionally consistent. They wanted small minimums for high schools. We didn't go below 1000 because that's a difficult number to project because that impacts things well beyond the considerations of this particular survey, including VHSL sports and program after school programs, etc, etc, so it was very difficult to go beyond below 1000 as an option, because we simply don't have a school at that point. And even if we were to add let's say another high school or various centers we likely wouldn't go below 1000 at any of our schools. The maximum had a lot of variability there really wasn't a lot of consensus within the Community about what would be a good maximum size. The plurality of support was behind about 1,200 students, which is slightly in excess of where Monticello and Western Albemarle High School are right now, but could push up to about 1,400, which sits right around where our average is for all of our high schools. There doesn't seem to be a lot of support for that 1,800, but there was a considerable amount of support for around 2,000, which was an interesting data point We don't have a lot of information about why people would think that a school that large that's so out of line with the rest of our state, as well as the market comparison that Maya showed us. We're not really sure why there's that support there. So after we completed this, we also did a review of some existing research on school sizes. If we click next, we reached out to EAB, and they did some research on ideal school size. And so I'm going to shift hats a little bit to go from statistics to economics. Economics is not my background, so I apologize to anyone who's listening who knows this stuff way better than I do. I'm using some terms loosely, but the idea that we got was there's not a lot of consistency in the research. There is some, there's plenty of research out there about ideal school size, but there's no one definitive answer of where is that ideal. What they identify are two competing priorities. The first is the The economies of scale right so as some resources are fungible you can increase the student enrollment without increasing that resource let's say a principal right, we can have a principal school of 100. We can also have a principal of school 300 so the cost for that principal doesn't change across the number of students enrolled. Except that the cost per pupil changes, so there creates an economy of scale. What the research did identify was the law of diminishing returns, which is where when you reach a point that the economies of scale begin failing. And it's specific to students who need specialized support. And so that was, if you look in that very far right column, the special education and disadvantaged populations, this is where the economies of scale begin to falter. And so if we give an example like Albemarle high school with roughly 2000 students enrolled and we have roughly 10% of our students identified as special education. That means there are potentially roughly 200 students who are in need of special education services at Albemarle high school. If we average roughly 10% 10 students on a caseload you're talking about 20 special education folks working at Albemarle high school in concert with one another. If anyone sat in a room of 20 people and tried to find agreement, you'll understand the law of diminishing returns when it comes to some of these specialized populations. Similarly, when we look at our students that are from economically disadvantaged homes, they receive special economic support around things like Title I. So if we start to increase the number of Title I teachers in a school, so you start to have five, six, seven, eight Title I teachers, it becomes very difficult for them to have productive PLC conversations. And so again, the law of diminishing returns becomes a problem. So there's not a right answer, but the idea is trying to maximize the economies of scale. But stopping before we hit that law of diminishing returns is what the research tells us is sort of the best idea. And I believe that's the end of my section.\"},\n",

I'm also a general internist as well. And thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak. First, I want to express my appreciation for the school board and all of the teachers and administrators at ACPS. It's been an unprecedented time over the past two years, and I really want to express my appreciation for all that you have done to support the teachers and the students and the staff, especially to keep our schools safe and have everybody return to in-person school over the past year in a safe setting and try to protect all of our students. Specifically, my son, my older son, has leukemia. He's been fighting leukemia for over the past three years and underwent a bone marrow transplant this past year. And I really want to express appreciation for how much Brownsville has done for him to keep him safe over the past three years and keep his brother safe in order to not transmit COVID to him prior to going through his bone marrow transplant. But I think the important thing to keep in mind as we keep these vulnerable populations safe is that we want to make sure that we keep are high risk patients and students safe. And we don't, we need to think about this equitably because it's not just students who have comorbid illnesses. It's also students who have parents at home who might have comorbid illnesses. It's also students who might have increased difficulty accessing care and if we if we change our policies without thinking about it ahead of time, we could actually kind of provide unequitable care to our students and kind of. shortchange them, so I think we need to think kind of critically about what we do if we end up changing our policies. ahead of time, so I think I really want to express appreciation for how you've addressed EO2. And just want to kind of how thoughtfully you have gone about protecting our students over the past two years, because I really greatly appreciate how well you've protected my son. I also want to appreciate how well you've taught diversity and history. And I hope that you guys continue to kind of think about the diversity curriculum in terms of how you teach it within our schools to make sure that they're prepared for facing the greater world. going forward, because I think it's really important that we prepare our children to really be aware of different cultural backgrounds other than our own, so that when they go to college or go to graduate school, they're fully prepared. And I'm not sure if EO1 will really prepare us for that. Thank you. I appreciate your time.\"},\n",

For the past week, I've had this non-word stuck in my head, all the moral, and it's stuck there because the ACPS mission is really to help all students thrive. And I see that all of you and ACPS have been working so hard to achieve this during incredibly difficult times. So tonight, I really just want to share how much we parents and families appreciate all that you're doing. So first of all, thank you to you school board members during a difficult time when it feels like public education itself is under assault. You've put in way more time and energy than I'm sure you thought you'd signed up for. And thank you for supporting the policies like the continued masking, at least for now, that are keeping our community safe. I also want to thank the principals and ACPS leaders, Dr. Haas and others who are on the call, not only for doing your jobs, but for serving in classrooms and on the bus lines and keeping our schools open. It's amazing. I want to thank the school nurses who have been great for putting themselves at daily risk to preserve the whole county's health. Our bus drivers are amazing. They're so lovely. They're getting our kids to school safely, including up and down some really steep, icy, narrow roads, in my neighborhood at least. And I want to really say how much I appreciate the bus drive, sorry, the substitutes, because I know that they're showing up to classrooms where they know there have been positive COVID cases, and they're still there, and they're keeping the schools open. And I have to send a call out to the school counselors for helping kids like mine who are struggling not only with physical illnesses, but also mental health issues and no surprise related to academic issues. And also to the counselors who are helping us parents who are really frankly sick with worry about pretty much everything these days. But most of all, I wanna thank the teachers because not only in the face of the pandemic, but also in the face of so much criticism and even scary political threats. They are all continuing to teach and inspire my kids. There are amazingly wonderful things happening in my kids' classrooms, and I just want teachers so much to know that the families of ACPS really support you. And that's it. Thank you all.\"},\n",

If it's going to be early capacity, there's an importance to Crozet Elementary and to Mountain View because they're busting at the seams. And so, let me just take that down. And it all came down to money for, well, for me, that if we had the money to work with in order to work on capacity. That if we didn't, no, we would work on capacity. But if we didn't, then potentially modernization of our existing facilities could be a place to put our CIP money for a year and hopefully get back up to to the regular numbers. But the number one thing and the big idea of it was we got to solve capacity issues. We talked about a number of things in there. One of the reasons for the school center too was that it was promised in the 2016 school referendum because if we all remember that was In addition to the Woodbrook project, it was the big project to be able to provide a relief from a capacity for Albemarle High School and Western Albemarle High School. And they were still going to need that capacity release. And one point that was made that was so important is that space is increasingly important. during the pandemic because of the spacing needs.

       "    'content': \"Well, I, I would support that, but if you recall our process, it, The drivers range was always the first choice, both of Roslyn Schmidt and the Boys and Girls Club, and in the end, after lengthy. We had a program evaluation done of the drivers and program which found no difference, no, no. advantage to having the driver's course over what we have at the other schools. We still didn't act. We instead did an RFP that delayed the process by four more months, at which time the Boys and Girls Club was concerned about retaining its funders. So they proposed reluctantly the secondary choice. I don't know if those of you who have not walked that site behind Jack Jewett, it's a sloping ditch. It's a terrible location. It can physically happen. But as you can see from the list of water drainage and clearing out hiking trails and clearing out woods. It is a much less good sign. They had hoped until the past six weeks that they could get some of that shortfall in funding from the Board of Supervisors. The Board of Supervisors historically has chipped in in certain kinds of communities. benefit projects, like the new senior center made a small contribution to that. So there was precedence for that. But they were told unambiguously a couple of weeks ago that they would not get any money, in fact, which is unfortunate, the timetable. But that is what the timetable was. I This is in my district. I'm, of course, particularly concerned with re-envisioning that whole campus. But I think without denigrating in any way the passion of the driver's ed staff, I think that our program evaluation showed it is the quality of the staffing and the program and not specifically that driver's range. that makes the Albemarle County Public School Drivers Ed Program exemplary in the state. And, you know, kudos to them. And it's one of those awful situations where you have to choose between two goods. And I choose generally a good that will touch more students. And we have three to five hundred students per year that will be touched by the Boys and Girls Club. And I don't want to have another year of fundraising delay before they break ground.\"},\n",

I don't know that I would term the other location a terrible location. It was not the preferred first location. And to the RFP process, if we all remember those of us who were on the board, that that was done because it was the right thing to do. We had not set this out for bids. Mr. Page and I sat on the committee to make that decision from the different vendors, and it was the right thing to do. It was not ideal, and it was not, I think, No, I would say it was appreciated by the Boys and Girls Club. It was probably a frustration. And I know Mr. Pierce is watching this right now. And I think there was a real frustration on it. But in some ways, the timing of this is fairly propitious because the Boys and Girls Club is going through a change of architect. And they have some other work that they have to be doing in terms of redesign. And so the timing is actually pretty good for this. I understand that we thought this was put to bed, but at the same time, this timing is not all that bad. Yes, I think, Mr. Page, you moved. Mr. Page, that the department will be contacted I agree with Dr. Acuff's comments that this is a terrific department, there are terrific people in that department, and the success of the program is largely due to that. I do believe, and this is something that some of you will remember from my comments back when this was all going on, that the roads around Albemarle High School Jack Hewitt, down to Ivy Creek, and down to Greer, and the parking lots involved could all be a fabulous location for the driver's program. I think we would have to probably build a tower or two in there so that instructors could see where the students were and get guidance from having seen them and they don't lose track of them. But I don't think that this is something that will, in the long term, damage the overall program, not with Karen running it. She'll make it work.\"},\n",

She may have. I just don't remember it. But I do remember that the board was pretty clear on the decision. And it was a decision made in good faith.

So we formed a work session committee, it was comprised of staff and representative board members, including Miss Lee and Mr. O'Carroll. We have drafted topics for the remainder of the calendar year. Before we get into the topics, I want to first start with the purpose of work sessions. The school board implemented the use of work sessions to gain greater understanding of critical issues facing the division and to provide staff with direction and support in the division's strategic plan. So in other words, work sessions are an opportunity for deeper work. And typically, the first meeting of each month is a business meeting, and then the second meeting is a work session. The committee has drafted a common framework for each work session outlined here. All work sessions will have a direct connection to the strategic plan. They will be data-driven, connect to current policies, and then all will conclude with a common discussion and ensure clear purpose and direction with questions such as, what further information does the board need? What are the next steps for the board on that topic? And always tying back into our funding and budget cycle as well. So there are six remaining scheduled work sessions in the calendar year. And so for each, you will see a date, a topic, and then the connection to the learning for all goal and strategy or objective. And so the first three, which will take us to the end of the school year are listed here. Our next work session is on March 24th, and that will be on what we're calling the first part of two that are focused on achievement data. And the topic will be a mid-year data review. In April, we propose a work session on the CIP. This will be a more global approach on the process and program as a whole and not about specific projects and will be an opportunity to better understand how the county assesses affordability, forecasting, financing options, as well as how we produce enrollment projections and other data. In May, we will plan a session about school climate and mental health. This will include information on student climate data, our counseling and SEL programs, instructors, such as responsive classroom, design development, and freshman seminar. As we come back from summer, right, in August, we will start with a session about intervention services, and that will include RTI, SPED, ESOL, and our title programs. In September will be the second part of the achievement data discussion and that will focus on the year end data. It will also be an opportunity for the board to develop their goals for the 22-23 school year. And lastly, we will conclude with the work session about school board, community and stakeholder engagement. We're still working on the details of these, but we've talked about a deeper dive on the role of advisory committees, perhaps reflection on the work of the work you just discussed or other topics. So with that, I will ask if there's anything Mr. O'Carroll or Ms. Lee would like to add or expand on and then open it up for discussion and feedback.\"},\n",

So that, for example, we have, Mr. Holden showed me a resolution that a board recently developed to make decision to alter their relationship with their police department. And what they did is they structured it as a resolution that provided their, you know how like when you make a resolution, it starts with the reasons for why you're doing what you're doing. And then also it provides a step-by-step understanding of how that relationship is going to be undone or redone, reconsidered, altered in some way. So it spells out the particulars of the change so that your constituents understand the change that you're making in pieces. And also the board has a clear understanding of what's changing and what's not changing and why that's occurring. So what we wanna do as we've done, I think we had a very successful budget process this year, although it ended with us going into a recession. But the reason I think it was successful was because we worked transparently and worked back and forth with the board to get to where you wanted to get in the decision-making process and it became very clear to everyone what the decision was gonna be. So we're hoping that by July 9th, that through the direction of the board, we'll be able to present a resolution to you that can be put in front of you by the chair, and then looking for a motion to support that resolution for the change. To me, it's like a breadcrumb trail. that you're laying out into your decision so that it's not just a yes or a no or not just we're gonna undo this, but we haven't really made any kind of considerations for what the undoing looks like or how it's gonna be structured.

I forget what they were for, to be honest with you, but I just have to say. So he was, I have to say, first of all, I'm really proud of Robbie. That's customer service right there for him to be out there doing that. The other thing he told me was that our summer school enrollment is very high this summer. It's much higher than it has been in the past. I asked him how much higher, he didn't have the numbers on hand, but he said, It's 612. Did someone say something? It's 612 students. OK, great.

One is we have opened our summer school registration for our high school students, just to let you know that that will continue as we have in the past. Our high schools are, those courses are virtual, so we have no real changes there. The first day of registration, we had more students than we've ever had before on our first day. At this point, we have 360 students registered. That registration is open until June 5th. Typically, we have about 400 students that come to summer high school, summer school. Most of the students that have registered so far are in PE and health, which is typically our trend. And we have about 35 students registered for econ and personal finance. So just wanted to let you know, if you hear about summer school for high school, that's, we're continuing in the fashion we've been doing for the last several years. The second item I have is just to let you know that the Return to School Task Force has convened and met twice this week. We are each, there's four areas of focus. We're looking at healthy students, healthy environments, healthy staff, and healthy instruction. There is a key central office person and a principal that are leading each of those smaller work groups. And at this point, it looks like about 12 educators on each of the work panels. So it looks at this point, we probably have over 60 educators, now Markham Public Schools, working on this document that we will have finished by June 1st. And then we'll begin to vet with multiple groups, health advisory, teacher advisory, et cetera. And then we'll be bringing that to you at your June 11th meeting. And this is a guidance document that will help us make sure that we're understanding what our steps are when we return to school. Thank you, Dr. Haas.\"},\n",

       "   {'role': 'Speaker_1',\n",
       "    'content': 'I have an announcement. Thank you, Mr. O\\'Carroll. It is not possible today to turn to a radio or TV or website or to pick up a newspaper without reading about the very best in our country. Every day we are learning about those who had great personal risk and sacrifice of putting the interests of others ahead of their own. What would we do without them. It is one of life\\'s great ironies that in times of tragedy that our community best learns about those who routinely dedicate their lives to the service of others. We admire those on the front lines of our hospitals, clinics, and medical offices. We are grateful for their courage and their selfless dedication. I want to tell you about another such hero who comes from a different place. A recent NPR story was about a student in another part of the country who said about her educator, and I quote, she wasn\\'t just concerned about me getting good grades. She was concerned about me being a good human being in life. She would always ask me how my mom is doing because my mom was kind of sick. Things like that she didn\\'t have to do because it wasn\\'t school related. She built my confidence up because I was so insecure about being smart, or the skills that I wanted to have, or the goals that I wanted in life. I could always hear her telling me, you belong here.\" End of quote. The student went on to say how in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, she reached for her phone to text a message, and how she stopped in mid-sentence, realizing she would not get a reply. Her friend, the teacher, was among the hundreds of educators across this country who had lost their lives to COVID-19. Here in Albemarle County, we know about the contributions our teachers make in the classroom every day of the school year. We know about their creativity, the determination, the passion, and the joy of our educators bringing to the lives of our children. We measure that on tests and examinations. We calculate that in our graduation rates. We celebrate that in the academic awards our students earn. And even tonight with the three young ladies that we heard. Less visible, but deeper in value, more life-changing is what is not captured by a number. It is revealed in the comments of the student in the NPR story, in the self-esteem, confidence, friendship, trust, and kindness she gained from an educator. As a teacher for 24 years with Albemarle County Public Schools, I had the privilege of working next to hundreds and hundreds of educators who provided these gifts to the students. Here\\'s what one of our parents in the midst of the current COVID-19 crisis wrote on Facebook. And again, I quote, with joy to listen to my fourth grader talk to his fabulous teacher. It is hard to tell who is more enthusiastic. I know this time away from students is soul crushing for teachers who\\'ve dedicated their lives to educating our children. Thank you all that the faculty and staff are doing to keep us connected. End of quote. This past week was Teacher Appreciation Week across our nation, and one week from this evening, we will be celebrating teachers who have received a Golden Apple Award. They are excited to serve students and families. In fact, the past few weeks have been a time to honor many of those who unselfishly serve our students and their families. They included Assistant Principals Day, National Library Week, Student Leadership Week, Administrative Professionals Day, National Physical Education Week, Principals Day, National Music Week, and School Nurses Day. Normally, each of these occasions would feature special programs and activities. And while the public health restrictions in place to protect us from COVID-19 make this anything but a normal time, they do not diminish the everyday accomplishments and attributes of these highly dedicated and extraordinary professionals. So in light of that I would like to make a motion that our board expresses its deepest appreciation to our teachers, administrators and staff, but they\\'re exceptional public service, and for being so important to the success of our students and families to our school division and county, and to our together. Are you on mute, Mr. O\\'Carroll? I just took myself off of mute.'},\n",

Because its scope specifically extends to the school board, it allows the school board to meet virtually and continue with its essential functions without confining subject matter of its meetings to just the emergency itself. This is what I announced in our first Zoom meeting that we anticipated coming in the middle part of this month. It happened as of last night. And I think all of us are genuinely appreciative of what the Board of Supervisors did. I also want to thank Mr. Holden for working with Mr. Kampner, who's the attorney for the Board of Supervisors on this issue and for guiding us through the virtual meeting process as a whole.

We're going to need more data from our parents around transportation, if they are going to transport their children, and if they're going to come to school. Because all that information allows us to determine how many students we can transport at a time and how many parents. We also have been working with the health department about the recommendation around transportation. If you read some of the guidelines, it looks like it might be every other seat. So for our biggest buses, that's 12 students and For other conversations, it might be every seat, there's one student. So we're trying to get some more definitive information around that because that changes the number of students that we can get into the building every day. And we're determined and really pushing ourselves to get as many children in the buildings as we can.

And I don't think we do. Like, we only have five SROs. Your elementary school right now, there is not a police officer monitoring elementary schools. We are not taking that away. Because there were parents that were like, well, yeah, I do want it. And they pull it. But I'm like, it was never there to begin with. I don't think. But I don't know. I'd be.\"},\n",
       "   {'role': 'Speaker_8',\n",
       "    'content': \"You're correct. So there are five. And actually, at one time, Right around the time I came to the county in 2004, there were more school resource officers than there are now because there was one in each high school and then there was also one in each middle school. And then during the recession, when the local government and the schools lost a significant amount of funding, the SRO program was reduced and it went down to three. And then over time we added back one so that there would be a school resource officer to be at Murray High School and also kind of work at Burleigh kind of because they're close to each other. And then another one was added not too long ago to be another police officer at Albemarle High School because there are 2,000 students at Albemarle as opposed to 1,000 at Monticello and at Western. And also, they wanted to be able to have a police officer that could kind of circulate among the elementary schools and middle schools in the Northern feeder pattern without not having one at Albemarle while that person was out and about if they needed to be. I think that for the elementary schools, the most times when police might come to an elementary school is when there's like a heads up that there's going to be an upset parent that maybe has once a better custody arrangement and can't seem to get it. That's that's typically when I'll hear like you know that a police officer has an SRO has been deployed to go to one of the elementary schools is because a father or a mother or someone has said I'm coming to the school tomorrow and I'm going to take my child whether you stop try to stop me or not. That's typically like how that might come about. But to to the point that several board members have made, there's not a, in fact, I think one of the things that Dr. Acuff was arguing for was a greater accounting of the police presence at the schools because while they are assigned to be at the high schools, they're often not there because they're in training or because they have other uh, responsibilities that the police expect them to fulfill. Um, you know, they're not at the school every day. They're not, um, they're sometimes for a good part of the day because they've had to go to court or something like that. And I think one of the ways that, um, that you might rationalize that is because we, we pay for half of a police officer and the County pays for the other half. So, they're just not going to be there 100% of the time. So that was another thing I think that was sort of holding up our negotiations back and forth with the police department was we wanted greater accounting for the time that the police were in the schools. So anyway, that's just a little bit of perspective.\"},\n",

The school mass requirement helps us make sure that our daughter can be in school learning while our son's health is protected. And I'm incredibly grateful to you all for not forcing our family to choose between one child's education and another child's health. But even if that wasn't our situation, we would still support keeping masks in place for now. We teach our kids that their choices and actions have consequences. Wearing a mask isn't just an individual choice. It has consequences for the people, the kids, the teachers around you. Our schools are helping our children learn to be good citizens, to consider the impact of their actions on the people around them. My daughter understands that she wears a mask not just to keep her little brother safe, but to be compassionate and considerate of the people in our community. That includes her friends, teachers, and school staff who have health conditions themselves, or vulnerable family members at home. And we keep wearing masks to respect the work and sacrifice of the healthcare workers who are struggling through incredibly long hours in the midst of another COVID surge. We are all eager to be done with COVID and put the pandemic behind us. But the reality is just that we're not there yet. And we've all got to come together for a little while longer to stop the spread of this disease and keep each other safe.

First I want to communicate my gratitude for pausing the Henry, the Henley advisory pilot that created so much division last year. I truly appreciate that it is under review and hope that it will be brought into compliance with Governor Yonkin's Executive Order No. 1. My wife and I are grateful for the Governor's Executive Order and respectfully ask that you please work in good faith with the new State Superintendent of Public Instruction to review and remove divisive and partisan curricula from our schools. Second, we also encourage you to please focus renewed attention on the learning loss of our children. Students have already lost so much instructional time due to the pandemic. And we've lost so many days due to weather this month alone. We do understand that you have I think it is nine bank days. that prevent a need to make up an equivalent number of snow days. In ordinary times, I agree that would be a great approach and a great strategy, but these are not, unfortunately, ordinary times. Like Charlottesville, I'm hoping that you'll find days and ways to be able to make up the instructional time. Our teachers, I think, need that, just as they need and deserve higher pay for the great work that they do. Our children certainly need that as well. Please do focus more on instructional time as well as academic rigor, the high standards and merit that we all seek, creating equal opportunities for all of our kids, and helping our kids develop resilience to face adversity. And please let us as parents help you in that endeavor. We're willing to work with you. In the end, we all want our children to be competitive for college, the job market, or whatever path they might choose. We want to help you prepare the child, our children, for the road, but not the road for the child. It will not serve them well in the end. Thank you so much for your time.

I'm also a general internist as well. And thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak. First, I want to express my appreciation for the school board and all of the teachers and administrators at ACPS. It's been an unprecedented time over the past two years, and I really want to express my appreciation for all that you have done to support the teachers and the students and the staff, especially to keep our schools safe and have everybody return to in-person school over the past year in a safe setting and try to protect all of our students. Specifically, my son, my older son, has leukemia. He's been fighting leukemia for over the past three years and underwent a bone marrow transplant this past year. And I really want to express appreciation for how much Brownsville has done for him to keep him safe over the past three years and keep his brother safe in order to not transmit COVID to him prior to going through his bone marrow transplant. But I think the important thing to keep in mind as we keep these vulnerable populations safe is that we want to make sure that we keep are high risk patients and students safe. And we don't, we need to think about this equitably because it's not just students who have comorbid illnesses. It's also students who have parents at home who might have comorbid illnesses. It's also students who might have increased difficulty accessing care and if we if we change our policies without thinking about it ahead of time, we could actually kind of provide unequitable care to our students and kind of. shortchange them, so I think we need to think kind of critically about what we do if we end up changing our policies. ahead of time, so I think I really want to express appreciation for how you've addressed EO2. And just want to kind of how thoughtfully you have gone about protecting our students over the past two years, because I really greatly appreciate how well you've protected my son. I also want to appreciate how well you've taught diversity and history. And I hope that you guys continue to kind of think about the diversity curriculum in terms of how you teach it within our schools to make sure that they're prepared for facing the greater world. going forward, because I think it's really important that we prepare our children to really be aware of different cultural backgrounds other than our own, so that when they go to college or go to graduate school, they're fully prepared. And I'm not sure if EO1 will really prepare us for that. Thank you. I appreciate your time.\"},\n",

I had never attended a topping out ceremony in my life. And so having said that, probably about 100 people gathered over at Crozet Elementary School on Wednesday morning, right before lunchtime to celebrate a topping out ceremony And what it means is that the structural frame of the new school addition had reached its highest point. So they put the highest beam on the new addition. So construction workers, contractors, architects, school and county project managers, administrators. Ms. Crummey was there, of course, because she's the principal. And school board members gathered to celebrate the exterior structure of the building. So this addition and renovation to Crozet Elementary School is really something to celebrate. It is the largest construction project for Albemarle County Public Schools since Baker Butler opened in 2003. It's almost 20 years. The school will also boast the county's first, it'll be the first county building, not just the county school building, with a geothermal HVAC system. It will create new capacity for 350 students and, as you know, the board is redistricting 219 students to attend there from Brownsville. And I would just share a few notes. Ms. Schmidt gave these notes at the meeting. Just really want to share our appreciation, especially with the construction workers, because this was really meant to celebrate the construction crew, which there were always about 60 members of the construction crew out there working long hours. And at times, there was up to 100. And if you can imagine having school and having students in the school while the whole structure around the school is being worked on, you can appreciate that the construction team really does everything they can every day to minimize disruptions to the school. And they've done a great job. And they've kept the project on track. We just really want to thank Tulsa Cook, who is the superintendent for Nielsen, Rocky Moulton, the project manager for Nielsen, Ken Thacker from VMDO, of course, Lindsay Snoddy, our director of building services, Matt Workman, who's the project manager from the county, Gwedet Crummy, principal, and over 20 different subcontractors.

So thank you to Dr. Harrison and other folks from community engagement who helped present that program. And also thank Ms. Underwood and Mr. Gillespie for being in attendance at our meeting tonight. We always appreciate having our principals here with us. So thank you so very, very much. And Dr. Haas, good to hear the news about the topping ceremony, the topping off ceremony.

We do have information in here in terms of more dedicated split out of our revenues a more operational split out on where our expenses took place, but where the rubber meets the road as we're budgeting and planning for next fiscal year is fund balance information. So if you remember correctly, we finished at the end of fiscal year 21 with a very positive fund balance, $15 million. There were significant plans for that fund balance, So we have the initial $15 million fund balance. Our adopted budget called for the use of $5.2 million. And then we had some significant carry forwards of items that were unfilled from the prior year. Carry forward of purchase orders, the Mountain View project, and ESOL WIDA funding associated with prior year purchases that did not get filled in time to meet prior year expenditures. We also had a significant transfer of money to the CIP. So when all of these transactions take place right here, we got down below the limit of the 2%. In the current year, we did have $4.1 million associated with a revenue update that took place in December. the $10 million revenue update that we had in December. And then here's an additional, the $5 million, nearly $5 million that we were anticipating having available at the end of the fiscal year. So we're projecting at the end of this fiscal year, we should have around $13.6 million in available fund balance at the end of the fiscal year, assuming that we just stopped operations. When we look forward to 22-23, of that $13 million fund balance, the budget that you just adopted includes almost $4.1 million in the use of fund balance. Staff at this point believes that we do have, we will be bringing forward proposals for Suggested uses of one-time funds in light of the multitude of identified needs that have been brought forward to the board over the last few months. We will be bringing forward suggested uses of approximately $5.4 million of one-time fund balance money as part of the April 14th school board meeting. And assuming that those items are brought forward, we would have an available fund balance of approximately $4.1 million, which is below the 2% threshold set by Board of Supervisors policy.

I've been really privileged to work with a diverse group of students from all of our high schools who, as a result of the policy that you all passed, on anti-racism. And as you know, one of the regulations of the policy is that we have a, that we impanel a student organization that is responsible for promoting anti-racism across the school district and with their peers. The group that we have put together consists of some of the students who were instrumental in writing the policy, as well as other students and they range in grade from 10th to 12th. We're working on a plan to reach out to younger students so that we have a constant flow of students. One of the things that we do with each of our meetings is we spend some time unpacking the concept of being anti-racist. And we've been looking at the differences between individual, structural, and institutional racism. And as part of that conversation, the students got to talking about COVID-19, and they thought that with the information that we're now learning about the misrepresentation, or not misrepresentation, the over representation of people of color in terms of mortality, with respect to the virus, and recognizing that some of that comes from health care discrepancies and over-representation in essential jobs and things of that nature. The students thought that was a great illustration of institutional racism. And they thought that it would be a good idea to use this to illustrate the differences between the types of racism. And we were thinking about having a signature event. And so hence, the teen town hall virtual Zoom meeting was born. And we reached out to some folks with the Virginia Department of Health, as well as at UVA. And we will have Dr. Cameron Webb as our speaker, as well as Dr. or Mr. Lawrence Pilkey, who is the father of one of our student leaders. Mr. Pilkey works in the ICU at Martha Jefferson. Dr. Webb is a physician and a lawyer from the University of Virginia. He's been speaking out both locally and nationally about COVID-19. And they have both generously offered to be a panel We're fortunate that we'll have Dr. Haas giving some welcoming remarks. And the idea is to educate students on the intersection of race and COVID-19, and then also to educate them on what they can do to keep themselves as well as community members and their family members safe during this time. So we're very, very excited to be in partnership with the University of Virginia's Youth Next out of the Curry School, as well as the Equity Center on this activity. And the students asked me to please extend an invitation to you all to participate. We've created a Google form that students will be able to use to register and then be sent a password and a zoom link so that they can participate. Does anyone have any questions?\"},\n",

And that's getting candid feedback from students, initially in the high schools and eventually getting it into middle schools and potentially on from there. Early in the summer, I met, not in person, but I met a young woman who is a junior at Albemarle High School. Her name is Ella Vessel, and she started a club this school year. She'd been talking to me about it and hadn't gotten all the bylaws done and was going into a school fair to try and get members to work with her on it. And she's got 10 or 12 and so this is a real team and it's really now beautifully set up. It's called Albemarle Student Voice and it revolves around issues from county and school board division policies and how it affects students in their day-to-day experiences. Albemarle Student Voice uses Instagram to poll local students about these policies and give students a voice to provide feedback and insights to both the Board of Supervisors and the School Board. While Albemarle Student Voice is only active at AHS, Albemarle High School right now, Ella hopes to represent student voices at Monticello and Western Albemarle before the end of the year. It's her goal that Albemarle Student Voice will be a reference, a big part, and a resource for both students and our community leaders to better understand each other's strategies and positions and to create a more open community. She's a very impressive young woman and this is along the lines of what we were looking at in terms of getting more feedback. I know that Melanie has been working with Dr. McLaughlin on some surveys and some other means to solicit information from students. And ASV has currently pulled students online about the online school year and is looking to share their findings with us and with the Board of Supervisors. They're just in the process of compiling those data and getting it into a form that they could send to us, present to us, however that would work. They would also, and this is the part where I think we could actually help them, is they would welcome receiving any suggestions from the board that we would like to ask students about in their surveys. So the bottom line is, and I'm keeping mine under 25 minutes too, but I sure didn't want to give Ella a short shrift on this. I applaud her and her team and look forward to hearing further from them So if you get an email or emails or some sort of communication from Albemarle Student Voice, please open it and check it out. And she's one of these people who would really welcome a lot of feedback, a lot of fatiguing, and a lot of the wisdom that I think we could share with her. So that's all I have.\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"I have a couple questions about virtual learning. First, I want to say I do appreciate all of the work and planning that's gone into this. I know that we're not dealing with unlimited resources and we have to make a lot of really difficult decisions to educate 14,000 students. So I really appreciate all the work that staff has done and definitely the people on the ground who are doing every day. So I really appreciate that. I just have a concern about the equity between the virtual learning and the hybrid learning. Also because we know nationally and locally that more of our black and brown families are choosing that. So I just want to make sure that we have some assurances. It will be important to me that we have some assurances that that is robust for my decision making. Firstly, I have a question about intervention services. And I think a way for me to be able to get my head around this is to know how many students will lose intervention services in stage four as it is now. And I know that you don't have those numbers ready, but that's something that I would like to know next week. Also, I would like to know how instructional hours for the hybrid learners will compare with the instructional hours of the virtual learners in K-3, or pre-K-3, I guess, for the four-day-a-week students. I assume that the 4-5, 4-12, I guess, would be the same. But I just would like to know the difference, if there is any difference between the instructional time for those youngest learners. And then I also would like to know how if or how meal services will be affected. For the students who are at home. And then on a different note, I don't know if this is something that Ross considers or we consider how this works. But I wonder if we should be looking at updated mask guidance, given that the new variant is likely coming or here. I know that we've all read a lot in the news about how the single cloth masks are just not as effective now against that. So that's just something I guess I'll throw out there.\"},\n",

Dr. Fauci said having more layers is better. I listened to Dr. Osterholm. He said, you know, that could, having more than one mask could create issues. So I really think that we have to follow the guidance and advice of the medical professionals and do what's best. I mean, we have a school board policy on face masks. If we determine or we are advised that we need to modify that for medical reasons, we are more than willing and happy to do so and bring it to the school board with the appropriate modifications.\"},\n",

We see variations in viruses all the time. We've been expecting variants of this virus to come. The mitigation strategies that we talk about being NPIs or non-pharmaceutical interventions, i.e. masks, do not matter the individual strain. So instead of talking about that we would need a different mask, you would necessarily say that you need to double down on using masks. And I always tell people that when we think about this in public health circles, that the best mask is the one that someone is actually going to wear. And so we want to make sure that, you know, just like what you hear in kind of competing circles, that the masks that they wear are the ones that the kids are going to wear throughout the day.\"},\n",

When will they be instructed to what those processes have to be? And will that be before they get to school or will that be something right as they get in there? And will they also be instructed, and I'm assuming that our existing students have been, in terms of what to do once they leave school, how to use hand sanitizers at home, how to wash and clean because of the importance to the school community as well.\"},\n",

And that's what we did with our K-3 students, and that's what we'll do with our 412. We'll continue to do that. The advantage of having the students come in, half of them one day and half of them another day, is that you can spend your first couple of days transitioning and having those conversations with students.

My name is Chad Ratliff, and I serve as principal of the relatively recently merged community public charter school. and Murray High School. To give you a brief history, Murray High School, initially called the Education Center, opened in 1988 as a school of choice and housed in Virginia L. Murray Elementary School. The following year, the program moved from V.L. Murray Elementary to our current location, the former Rose Hill Elementary School, which had just become available with the opening of Mountain View, then Cale Elementary. Our school kept the name Murray but replaced the education center with high school by request of the approximately 20 students enrolled in the school at that time. Community public charter school, a middle school, opened about 20 years later and was originally housed inside Burleigh Middle School, relocating a few years later after that to our current location to be co-housed with Murray High. Of course, in February, 2020, your board approved the merger of the two schools into a new single 612 school entity that harkened back to the original philosophical concepts of both schools, which is a student centered learning pedagogical model and to serve as a lab school from which other schools can learn as it states in board policy and in state code. This merger initiated the naming process. I'm very honored to be here to share the work of our volunteer committee, which, as you know, became much more intensive and lengthy than they were likely thought they were signing up for. But we are so thankful and delighted by their volunteer time and so appreciative of the thoughtfulness in which they put through this. Our committee composition included five staff members, myself included, teachers, and an office assistant, two members of the community who do not have children in schools, three students served on the committee plus some additional feedback opportunities and special projects in addition to just the survey feedback model. And finally, five parents, including parents with children currently attending our schools and parents of students with children from all fear patterns that could possibly attend. One of our committee members also attended Rose Hill Elementary School when it was Rose Hill Elementary School. And I am now going to turn the presentation over to Miss Shelly Blakey. As you may know, the wonderful Miss Stephanie Passman served as our committee chair. She's unavailable tonight. So I'm happy to introduce you to Miss Blakey, who will address you this evening in her absence and on behalf of the committee.\"},\n",

We also had an amazing opportunity and really loved the process of taking the time to figure out what would be an appropriate name for this new merger of the school. So we also followed all the school policies. And we had two surveys. And as you all know, Our process took a lot longer than others. So we were very proud that we even had more respondents in our second survey. We had public participation. There were two committee meetings that we had virtually. We had emails that were addressed to the committee or our principal that really addressed concerns and thoughts that the public had about our school and what they felt might be appropriate to this exploration of a new name. What was really amazing for our particular group was that our principal was really able to talk via phone with some people in the Rose Hill community to get a sense of what was important and also to get a background about Rose Hill and also the building in which our school is currently located. With all of this information brought to the committee, we were able to extend that to our students. Our students did an amazing job of really trying to explore the historical and the geographical importance of Rose Hill. And so the students really felt like They had to be engaged in the history of the school and its surroundings before they could engage on a new journey with the merger of the two schools. They were able to use this information that they gathered to design a mural and also to get with the committee and brainstorm new ideas for the new school. One of the things that they did have that was really neat was a word association and it was amazing to see what words these middle school and high school students thought about that represented their school and how they felt about each other in the sense. So after further consideration, the committee and superintendent recommend the name Community Lab School based on the fact that it captures the vision and the mission of the new school. When we were either doing our survey or getting feedback from the public or even talking with our students and staff, the word community kept popping up. We felt like This was a word that really embodied how students feel when they walk into the school, as well as the staff to include teachers and also the parents. They feel like the school is a community. The students also really wanted as a word that was incorporated in the name of the school. They felt like this was a word that tied both the middle school and the high school together based on the type of learning style and teaching that goes on in the school. The nice thing about this name also is that it avoided confusion of having two schools in the division with the same name. We just felt that, you know, this was a long process, but an amazing one, and we feel like this name really embodies the school, the community, and the people that it serves.

I must admit that when the first time I heard about the lab school, I knew that it had to be a good idea, but I wanted to learn more about it. And your comments and Mr. Ratliff's comments really helped with that. And so I think it's a great idea.\"}]}]"
