The school board wishes, excuse me, the school board invites and actively seeks the public's input in the matters relevant to school board governance and provides for time during its business meetings to hear from Albemarle County residents and community members. The school board wishes to maintain appropriate meeting decorum so that persons can observe and hear the proceedings of the school board and that attendees online are not subject to inappropriate language and conduct. As my son I'm sorry is crying in the background, you know, he waited until it was my moment to speak and and this is when he's doing it so if you hear him. It is all right, my husband's dealing with it. As authorized by ordinance of the county of Albemarle the school board will hold its meetings. electronically during the COVID-19 pandemic. The school board is nevertheless committed to encouraging public comment despite its need to meet on a virtual basis. For this reason, there will be two ways for the public to provide comment. First, as always, written comments may be submitted to the school board clerk prior to the start of the meeting, and they will be given to all the school board members for review. And as long as the school board holds its meetings electronically, members of the public wishing to provide public comment during the school board meeting may sign up online by 2 p.m. the day of the meeting. Before electronic public comment starts, I'm going to announce the order in which your speakers will comment. I'm actually going to, there's 11 speakers, so I'll just announce the first three. Each speaker's access to public comment will be activated when it's that speaker's turn to provide comment to the members of the school board. Speakers are going to be notified when they reach the two minute mark and at the three minute mark. It is me doing the notification and it's generally just me waving when you're at the one minute mark and then waving when it's time to stop. Speakers during the meeting are those submitting written comments should state their name, address, or magisterial district. Further, speakers should limit comments to those matters that are relevant to school board governance or the operations of the school division. And lastly, although the school board will not respond to comments made during the public comment period, school board members may address comments at the end of the meeting agenda under other business. And with that, the first speaker, one second. is going to be Jen T.W., the second speaker is going to be Jeff Handler, and the third speaker is going to be Tara Ilgner.

I wanna start by thanking all staff and families for the time, patience, hard work and flexibility. Our two sons are in elementary school, pre-K and second grade for the virtual start. I appreciate the thoughtfulness, attention to detail and concern that their teachers and schools have shown. Our family also appreciates the cafeteria and bus staffs for daily meals via buses daily. The learning materials available that we pick up also help supplement and add to their seesaw learning and Zoom class meetings. Our family is finding what works for us and we're excited to keep learning and engaging with teachers and classmates. I'm also an educator for Albemarle County Public Schools. This is my 14th year with Albemarle County. I'm a collaborative high school special education teacher. I just wanted to share that my two different co-teachers and I have been forming great relationships already with students and families. Our Zoom classes are also successful and engaging. The attention to detail and creativity is evident. I've even had a new student, a ninth grader, call me on the phone to share a piece of work that she was proud of for another class. This is one week after meeting me. It just made me happy that she felt safe and interested to call me. But now I just want to share my concerns and fears for moving into phase three prematurely. And this kind of reminds me of my son's assignment about the power of yet. It's concerning to hear news of educators of varying ages who are not only becoming exposed or sick, but dying. College campuses, even in our own community, are places with increasing positive COVID cases and exposures. I feel that acting hastily and reopening before it's safe to do so, and there's a vaccine available, will push things back negatively. We should wait to vote on moving up in phases when it is safe to do so and cases are not steadily rising in our community and state. Teachers and staff has spent time doing extra PD to prepare to be more successful virtually and to get families and get more familiar with a variety of technology and online resources. Students and families are being asked for feedback so that changes and modifications can be made to make future lessons better and more engaging. We're putting extra time and energy to make this virtual start work. I wanna close with the reminder that we're all in this together. Thank you. Thank you, Jen.

Um, so I'm a citizen of Charlottesville resident Charlottesville, and, but I just had a question about the HMSA and the Mesa special education programs through Albemarle school. I understand that city children are not eligible for consideration for these Albemarle school academies. And I just wanted to understand why. I didn't realize this wouldn't be a question answer sort of situation so I'll just throw all my questions out there and you guys get to them as you can. But my questions are this. So I understand there may have been segregationist policies in the past that kept downtown Charlottesville away from the Albemarle schools, but is that still the policy? And if that's not the real reason why Charlottesville city kids can't petition or apply to attend Albemarle schools, is it because their families are not contributing taxes, in which case, why is tuition not an option? If the issue is that there are too many kids in Albemarle, wouldn't the application process allow the academies to regulate their size? So I'm just not sure I understand whether it's a size of the class issue or a funding or tax issue or segregationist issue. I just don't know what the reason is for keeping that. completely inaccessible to city kids. So my kids are residents of Charlottesville, as I said. I work at UVA in the Earth Sciences Department. I'm in graduate school for atmospheric chemistry. My kids are bright, but there are also lots of other kids here in the city who would, underprivileged children who would really benefit from this option. So basically what I'm asking is, is this separation necessary or just by preference? That's all.\"},\n",

We all know that we have confirmed cases. here the first weeks of phase two, right here in Elmira County. We all know the cases in Virginia are on the rise due to one big factor being UVA. Why would anyone even consider putting children's lives, their families, educational staff lives on the line when we know it's dangerous to do so? By the way, I teach at Albemarle High School in special education and government. I want to read what a senior wrote to me today, and he gave me permission for me to share it with you tonight because it was too late for him to get on. This is from Josh Francisco to everyone. about opening up schools before any form of effective medical advancement for the purpose of combating COVID would lead to nothing but disaster and is a move that is begging to get everyone infected. The concept of herd immunity is also worrying because not only is COVID an extremely painful experience, as testified by my friend in Italy, that actually currently has it. But also, you're not guaranteed to survive. My father, who is a nurse, has told me a true story here in UVA that a woman had COVID once before and is now recovering for the second time. And he specifically says, I'm not too fond of the idea of dying, coming close to dying, or being afflicted by something that is extremely painful. I don't think anybody else wants that either. I'm, I asked you as a member as to really carefully look at what the Elmira Educational Association has laid out. These are my words, not his now. Measurable, reliable benchmarks that can guide the school board in deciding when to move between phases. It's not OK for all this responsibility to be sitting in your lap. And I saw it on different times. You're saying, oh, should I open? Should I not open? Well, my goodness. You laid out exactly what each phase looks like. But it can't be just like nine weeks. And then it's going to magically disappear. An arbitrary nine weeks in one phase, then go to the next is not acceptable. You need to use science and data and look at the experts. I can only see that that's the way we could move forward, and it would help you to say you know if you don't like what lmr was laid out, and they're very specific. The Education Association on, and it seems like you have. Um, but make your own and make it clean and make it with CDC guidelines and, you know, and they've done that. So I just ask that you would really highly look at that. And by the way, I am teaching it at Elmorrow high school and, and it's, it is really working. I don't know how it works in the elementary, but I know we have more kids attending than before.\"},\n",

I gotta give my hats off to everybody in Amarillo County, public schools, all the staff, and everybody, the teachers that are making this work. We've got two kids, we've got a child at Baker Butler, another one at Jack Jewett, and it's been fantastic. As far as with as much, the minimal amount of resources y'all have gotten, and to be able to make it work as well as you could. Our first grader, you know, he's having a tougher time. He just loves being in school with friends and stuff. But, you know, we balance that with being in the emergency department and things are still tough. Supply lines, they haven't really bolstered them at a federal level. So we're not any better off. I don't know a single hospital of any of my colleagues that work at, they're back to single use PPE, you know, appropriate mask supplies and things like that. In the Charlottesville area, it's been, Last week, I think the university emergency department effectively shut down for half a day they went on divert because they were so busy they couldn't take any more patients which obviously. there's only two hospitals in our area, so people have to go somewhere but, and that is with we had a surge in July and August, and it was it was not a fun time and so we're off of that, but obviously with the weather changing. You know, we don't know what's going to happen. There's a flu outbreak I was reading in San Francisco today we were hoping we might escape that the southern hemisphere largely did but That's a gamble we have to take. Whatever you decide, we just need to take all that into consideration and that the fact that the virus seems to be spread primarily through the air by airborne vectors. I don't know that I've seen a confirmed, I don't know that I've personally seen a confirmed case of like an outdoor transmission. I'm not saying that's not possible, clearly, but people are outdoors and away from each other, you get a lot of ventilation, it's a lot safer and it's a lot harder to do as we go forward. I'm not just to make sure that whatever you decide to do that you're keeping all of that in consideration, because if we have to hit the brakes again and we should probably have a plan to do that. By the time we do hit the brakes, you know it takes two or three weeks. to slow down if that makes sense and catch up. And, you know, it's the emergency services folks that are gonna be sort of the brakes for that. So, you know, we're coming at it from two ways, both as a family that works in emergency services and with kids that we'd like to get back in school. So it's tough. And if you guys just make sure you take that into consideration as you go forward. Thank you.\"},\n",

I graduated from college and came to work for Albemarle County and this is my thirty first year. That being said, I am all in Albemarle County. That being said, I am in that age group where COVID is something that worries me. I am in that medical group where my doctors filled out all my ADA forms and I cannot return to a building. This virtual start has been amazing. I don't know many teachers that won't tell you that this has gone better than we ever thought it could. And that doesn't mean that we haven't had technology problems and Wi-Fi problems and problems. But the bond that I have already built with my children, I can't imagine in November losing the ones that go back into the building. I can't imagine that. And I don't think it will be good for them either because We've bonded under these pandemic circumstances and we're important to each other and we're learning and we're learning together and we're having fun. I know these parents at three weeks better than I have ever in years because they're sitting beside their kids, because they're walking behind their kids, because they're checking on their kids, because they're popping into Zooms to say, hey, Ms. Stallings, I need help with We text, we email, communication couldn't be better. It just couldn't be better. I'm speaking for myself and I know that everybody has a different point of view with that, but the majority of teachers I've heard from, it's been a very positive opening. So I'm asking you to really think about all of those kinds of things about how it's gonna affect the kids I'm asking you to really think before we move into stage three. And you're welcome anytime to pop into my Zoom class. I think you'd love what these little kids have to say about things. And I appreciate your continued hard work.

       "  'text': \"Hi, thank you so very much for having me. My name is Bo Odom. I'm a parent of a first grader at Greer Elementary. So we're in the Jack Jewett neighborhood. And really sincerely, I wanna thank our first grade teacher. incredible. We think she's fantastic. She's been working incredibly hard. When issues arise on Zoom, she's seeking to pivot to the next best option. She's sweet. She's kind. She's, she noticeably tries to care for each child present on Zoom. I assume she's a lot like Ms. Stallings and, and I would hope you'd all look, look up Archer's first grade teacher and give her a raise and give all these teachers a raise. But I, but I do want to say that, well, we have a first grader and I can only speak to that experience. But I think it's really imperative that you know what that experience is. And I believe Ms. Stongs when she says that it has been a good enriching experience for the children and they have a bonded relationship. But I would argue that this experience is not working for my first grader. I don't believe students are learning. Our daughter is not learning. I believe it's enrichment. I'd urge you to visit any first grade Zoom class. It's a bit of pandemonium. Distractions abound, and we knew that was gonna be an issue, but distractions compound with little attention first graders can dedicate to YouTube videos and whiteboards that are unfocused, and nine different other students continuously unmuting and forgetting to re-mute, and continuous background noises they add to the cacophony. And even if one student is overeager, they end up dominating the questions that are asked to the general class. answering the question before my daughter has an opportunity. And I want to be real. I mean, these are first graders. These are first graders. We shouldn't expect the kind of self-control that is necessary for an online format. I just want to say that I don't believe my daughter is receiving the attention that's necessary for learning at this age. I echo again how marvelous I think my daughter's teacher is. But the experiences in education, I would say it's enrichment. Yes, she's learning social cues. She knows What a mute button is, and she's getting ever so personal look at the range of privilege in this world. And I'm really, really grateful for those things. I know that we have an incredible amount of privilege in our household. We have good internet. We have a quiet place to retreat. We have two parents with flexible schedules who can be one of those parents in the background. But I can't even imagine what this experience would be for those without the privilege that we have. But in reading and math and particularly in writing, my daughter needs so much help. She's already tested and placed in remedial help in kindergarten. This is not a format of education for first grade. And it seems that the education that's necessary is simply impossible over Zoom. They are learning to enjoy and appreciate, but they're not practicing any skill building, the skill building that's necessary. Thank you so very much for taking my comments.\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"So hi, my name is Catherine Deatley and I teach kindergarten at Meriwether Lewis. And like many of the teachers in the county, I want nothing more than to go back to the classroom and be with my students. But I only want that when it is safe for everyone. When I read an AEA email stating the county was planning on proposing we go to phase three in November, my anxiety levels immediately went through the roof. The three main reasons for this anxiety are health, choice, and student impact. As an asthmatic, the idea of going back in a person during a global pandemic that involves a respiratory illness scares me. And as much as I want to see my students and my colleagues, the fear of possibly coming into contact with someone who unknowingly has COVID is real for any teacher, staff member, and student that is considered high risk. This leads me to my second reason for the anxiety, the choice I may have to make. If the rumor mill is true, then teachers will be given a choice to either go face-to-face or stay virtual. If we go face-to-face, we get to keep our class. If we remain virtual, then we lose our class. We lose our students that we have spent weeks getting to know and have built relationships, bonds, and trust with. I love and adore my students. And while virtual learning is not the ideal situation, we are making it work the best that we can. My students continue to amaze me every day with their resilience, persistence, kindness, and patience. And yes, there have been a few bumps here and there, but we are able to push on because we know that we are in this together. We continue to learn through singing, movement, discussion, art, games, play, and exploration. My kids are even writing at this point. All approaches that we are using are developmentally appropriate. And lastly, I have extreme anxiety over the learning experience my students will have if we go back face to face too soon. Research will tell you that our youngest learners learn best through play, movement, music, interaction, and hands-on exploration. If we go back face-to-face where we have to follow strict safety measures, the majority of what we know to be developmentally appropriate will be unusable. Instead, it will be replaced with our students trying to sit in a desk for the majority of their school day, six feet from the friends that they just wanna play with, looking at the toys that they can't play with. There will be no group exploration of dirt or games of chase on the playground. If we aren't able to teach our students in the best way we know how, just so they can stay safe, then what kind of education are we truly providing them with? And to ACPS, what is more important, keeping everyone safe while providing a developmentally appropriate education or simply putting warm bodies in a building where they will receive a mediocre education and run the risk of getting sick? Please fight for us and do what is right for everybody. Thank you for your time. And Katrina, thank you for saying my last name correctly. Katrina? I'm here. I can see you mouthing my name.\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"All right, well, in that case, I am going to go ahead and start my time. My name is Maggie Johnson. I am the German one and two teacher at Monticello High School here in Albemarle County. I live in Charlottesville City, but I teach in the county and I'm proud to. I'd like to first make it clear that my comments represent exclusively my own perspective and my own concerns. I do not claim to speak for any other teachers or any other staff or faculty in the county. I think it goes without saying that this virtual school year is not our ideal. I miss seeing my students. I am only in my second year of teaching, but I already have grown to love being in a physical classroom and being around students, and I miss them. And I miss the spontaneity of in-person teaching, and I miss being able to create a physical space to let my students learn and grow as people and within the boundaries of the language that I teach. But even considering the shortcomings of virtual education, the fact of the matter is that it is not safe for in-person instruction, even on a hybrid level, and it will not be safe to return to in-person instruction until there is an effective and accessible vaccine available. Put plainly, if we return to in-person schooling, even on a hybrid schedule, people will become sick with COVID-19, and people will die of COVID-19 as a direct result of that decision. Instead of worrying about when and how to return to in-person instruction, I think that the school board and the county as a whole need to focus on how to facilitate the best possible online instruction. The questions of when and how to return to in-person classes should not even be considered until the CDC approves distribution of a vaccine, and that vaccine is made accessible to every person. Instead, I would like for the school board to focus their efforts solely on supporting teachers, staff, students, and families in the district with online education. I genuinely believe that if we accept that this is our reality for the foreseeable future, instead of deluding ourselves with thinking we can return to in-person or hybrid for the 2020-21 year, we can learn powerful lessons as a county and as individuals to take into our instruction when it is safe. To emphasize that point to the minute I have left, I'd like to offer some improvements that I've already begun to see in my planning and teaching, even in these first three weeks of classes. Being limited to 45 minutes of direct synchronous instruction at the high school level means that I am making more deliberate intentional decisions about what, when, and how to teach material. This is allowing me to explore a flipped approach to my classes in which students take notes on grammatical structures or learn vocabulary asynchronously. And we then practice during synchronous classes. I am also able to focus more closely on students achieving proficiency and understanding with the material instead of feeling pressured to assign record graded exercises or assignments. The online format further means that I can explore new programs and technologies to incorporate into class, such as Flipgrid or Edpuzzle, which I've already started to use Flipgrid in my classes to make learning more engaging and more accessible to every student. When the day comes that it's safe to return to in-person, I'll be able to use these technologies as part of my standard curriculum because I'll have had plenty of experience using them in a variety of ways. That's all of the time that I have, but I have submitted comments via email to the school board that I would like for you to please review when you're considering the next steps for the county. Thank you.\"},\n",

And I just wanted to ask a few questions and hopefully raise a few points about moving to a potentially hybrid situation. And Right now, teachers are working really hard as they have been and as they tend to always do. And we've spent about a month with students and about two months planning. And we are still, you know, trying to make sure that we are doing everything we can and covering all of our bases without overtaxing the students. I'm worried that moving to a hybrid plan this soon while students are still figuring out how to handle Um, the, the virtual plan would only confuse things even more. And I just wanted to make sure we have a few things like hammered out before we actually move into a hybrid plan. And some things that I wanted to be aware of, um, will we prepare the schools, um, it to be disinfected and clean, or is that something a teacher is going to have to do? Um, is there going to be increased air ventilation in the classrooms, which already have, um, poor ventilation as it is. Are there going to be more resources and structures for the teachers to handle doing an online class as well as an in-person class? Because there's a lot of, a lot of our resources right now are already being stretched to the capacity, doing what we're doing as it is. So trying to do both seems like asking a lot. Are there going to be ways to ensure that students are actually abiding by the health protocols and not putting other people at risk? Will there be compensation for teachers who have children who are also in the hybrid plan and they can't leave their children at home? And will there be compensation for teachers who have to come in to a hybrid plan and put themselves at risk if their colleagues can't come in? And I don't mean to sound accusatory. I don't mean to sound antagonistic. I just want to make sure that we've considered a lot of these things that need to happen before we can safely move into a hybrid plan. Thank you for your time.

At the last school board meeting, I raised my concerns that the five stages of return to school had no health criteria associated with them. Without these criteria, there's no context. At the beginning of each meeting you all have, the school board meeting, you all discuss to some great degree the various statistics and data regarding COVID-19 in the health district. Without the context of criteria for each of the return to school stages, this is all meaningless. It's mere theater. Clearly, the school board has decided it's safer for some students to return to school and also for the children of teachers and staff to return for childcare at the schools. So of course, there must have been some health standards for them to return to the school that the school board hasn't released. I'm requesting again that you somehow come up with criteria for each stage of return to school and publish it so that we can know how close or far away we are from being able to return to in-school learning, which I think we all agree is best for the students.

And I hope, swear I wasn't trying to jerry-rig my way into the closing spot. That is just unfortunate. So I'll just sort of reiterate what I was saying. I'm a teacher. at Mountain View Elementary School. I'm in the Scottsville District along with my two kids. And I know you've heard a little bit, but I do want to reiterate that things are going really well. I have a first grader, and I just did want to respond to Bo's comment about skill building. If we were in person, responsive classroom says the first six weeks of school are all about building routine. So I don't think the education his child is receiving is any different than what he would be getting in the building. It takes six weeks to get to know your class, to build routines, And that's what's happening now. It just looks different and it's on Zoom. And my first grader is having a wonderful time. I really think that it's important that before you vote, that I really think every school board member should attend meetings with the staffs at the schools that you represent. I appreciate Ellen and Graham are already going to be coming to Mountain View along with Dr. Haas. and anyone else that wants to, I think hearing from the teachers is crucial. And unless you really make that transparent, I think that you're missing out on a huge piece of information that teachers can provide. We can let you know how things are going. We can let you know what in-person looks like at current status. We can talk about how we've problem solved and we can talk about how well things are going. And we can also, you will find out soon how many teachers will not be returning in person until it's safe. I think you need to know that before voting. I also think that it's really important that transparency in the medical and in the teacher capacity is really evident before voting. Um, I also want to say that as in the same way that our school system when we have a snow day, sort of, even though some schools might have totally fine roads nearby and you're thinking man why do we have a snow day these roads are fine but we've got those dirt roads way out in the county and it's not safe for them. By the same token, I see one more minute. By the same token, at some schools that are much smaller, maybe they feel much more equipped to take on phase three. At my school, that would be 470 students would be eligible to come in for phase three. And that's just not sustainable. Right now we have 15. So to go from 15 to 470, Potential students is just, that's really a hard pill to swallow, and I don't know how we would do that. So I really think that getting to know your schools and really figuring out what each phase looks like is really important. So that's all. I really feel strongly that you know that phase two is going well, and the biggest complaint I hear is the schedule, and I have some solutions to that if you'd like to hear them, but that's all I have to say. Thanks.\"},\n",

Earlier today, the U.S. Department of Education announced their National Blue Ribbon Awards for Excellence in Academic Performance. For the first time in the program's 38-year history, a Virginia school has received the department's Exemplary Award for Closing Achievement Gaps. I'm proud to say that our own Baker Butler is one of four schools in our state to meet the very high standards for this recognition. In fact, of the 1,800 schools in Virginia, only 58 even qualified in this category. The award covers three school years beginning with 2016-17. Over this time period, SOL pass rates for English language learners, special education students, and students from economically disadvantaged homes increased by 87% for math and 78% in reading. Yes, those are increases, not the pass rate. This far exceeded the increase in overall pass rates of 15% in math and 11% in reading in Virginia. As a result, the achievement gap in reading was reduced from 24 down to 11 percentage points, and the gap in math fell from 16 percentage points to six. These achievements will be featured in our spotlight on education during our October the 8th meeting, but I would like to congratulate the outstanding and remarkably talented faculty, staff, students, families, and of course, previous principal Steve Saunders and current principal Seth Kennard for your outstanding work. This is a nationally renowned accomplishment. And as impressive as these numbers are, I know the school's motto will be the best is yet to come. Thank you.\"},\n",

As you can see, this first slide is the seven day floating average of the number of cases per 100,000 people. and see that the numbers have, well, they call this trend fluctuating, but the numbers are lower now than they were in the end of August. And overall, we've been seeing a downward trend with the case burden or the floating average of the cases. The percent positivity rate for testing in Elmar County has been steadily going down. You can see we're down at 3.6%, which is one of the lowest rates we've had at least all summer. That has been decreasing. Now in the city of Charlottesville, it's a little bit different. We have been on an upward trend of number of cases. Some of that can be, I think most of the increase can be attributed to UVA cases. But we wanted to explain that the metrics we received from the Virginia Department of Health are intended to provide a starting point for conversations and decision making. We do not have absolute benchmarks for which people are clamoring. It is, we believe it's important to contextualize the data. For example, UVA does have an impact on the case counts in the city, but not so much on the county.

       "  'text': \"Ryan? Thank you, Eileen, appreciate that. So, again, my name is Ryan McKay, senior policy analyst for the Thomas Jefferson Health District. And one of the things that we've been looking at closely throughout the pandemic are a lot of the numbers as they relate to positivity rates, the raw data of case counts, and certainly the cases per 100,000, both on a daily basis, but over the course of a 14 day period of time. And I think Eileen hits the point very well in terms of context. what goes into these numbers, what goes into the seven-day positivity trend of 3.6. There are a number of factors that we have to consider when it comes to decision-making, whether it's for schools bringing students back or implementing community-wide mitigation strategies that the Board of Supervisors implemented back in late July and early August. So part of that is understanding where we've been doing testing and where the positive results come from. If we do a point prevalence survey in let's say a long term care facility or at the regional jail. One of the things that we would look for are the total number of positives related to those. Those will drive up many of the numbers in our localities. For example, Fluvanna County was at about 3.2 to 3.4% just over a week ago, and now they're up over 7.4% positivity rate over the last seven days. We can attribute that to one event in the outbreak at the Fluvanna Correctional Facility for Women. Similarly, we can identify increases based on relationships with the university and student transmission there. While we haven't really seen the huge uptick within the county, we can attribute some of the cases and the case incidence rate 100,000 to students who live in the county or cases that are attributable to UVA in general. And so I think it's really important to understand what the background is to some of these testing rates. The other is, and I think it might be a little confusing, sometimes is with the UVA, I'm sorry, the Charlottesville numbers, you notice that they're in bright red. It's at 48 per 100,000, but the positivity rate is below 5%, which is ideal for what we need to do as public health. What that tells us is there's massive amounts of testing going on, and that's not just limited to UVA testing students and faculty. That goes to community testing that's happening throughout Albemarle County and Charlottesville and throughout the health district on a daily and weekly basis. The more we test, the greater access that we provide to that testing, and the more frequently we do that, the idea is that we want to find those cases. We want to make sure that we can isolate individuals who test positive, that we can identify their close contacts, those who are within six feet for more than 15 minutes at a time, who may need to quarantine and monitor for symptoms themselves. And that's really critical, because from our perspective, we want to make contact with those individuals within 24 hours. The more we can do that, the more likely it is that we can contain, not just mitigate. Difference being mitigation slows the spread, containing stops it. From our perspective, one of the important data points that isn't necessarily publicly released is our ability to do that within 24 hours. And we feel pretty confident that we can do that consistently at or above the 95% rate. So I think the context behind the data is important. And as Eileen mentioned, it's a starting point for a broader discussion to determine what the risk may be. We heard often tonight about safe. And I think that's really hard to define. What we can better define is potential risk involved. And what are we doing, not just in relation to the positivity rates and the case counts, But what are we doing holistically as a community to mitigate and minimize risk? It goes to wearing the face masks, physically distancing, doing symptom checks as a whole system as opposed to just focusing on what the percent positivities are. We have examples within our health district and within the state of schools that have opened at varying levels of positivity rates, at varying levels of cases per 100,000. And I think what it's important is to, yes, look at those data points as a part of the conversation, but also understand what the ability is of a school system to implement the strategies that are going to reduce and minimize risk to the greatest extent possible. So with that, I'm happy to answer questions about the data, about indicators, and any other questions you have about COVID-19 from the public health perspective.\"},\n",

And so we would be able to provide at least that level of data In terms of exact numbers, we'll certainly look into what we can provide and BDH may be able to say, yes, you can break that down into cumulative numbers. It wouldn't be at a current, with the current number of outbreaks or the current number of cases within a school that occurred associated with that outbreak. But we will be able to at least show the cumulative number of outbreaks on our public facing dashboard. I think the other part of that is those weekly calls school systems have reported that a case has occurred, based on media reports, they've been asked to share details in terms of how was the process to identify close contacts. what were the lessons learned from those experiences. And then we can also share about process and procedure and protocol so that other school systems can learn from those responses to those individual cases and then make adjustments accordingly based on their own plans.

That's not to say it can't occur, or maybe it's occurred and we just haven't been made aware yet. But the impact of UVA coming back to grounds has been less impactful on the county than it has been on the city. And I think for the city, it's that there are so many students and far more students that are living off grounds than on grounds, which has changed that a little bit. And that there's the ability to isolate and quarantine in off grounds housing, it's more difficult than it is to do so on grounds.\"},\n",

Certainly happy to get more information in terms of the state level or other localities experience something different, but at least locally, I'm not aware of the use of the app related to case investigations or contact tracing. OK, thank you. Mr. McKay, do we have any prevalence data that's finer grained than Albemarle County, say, for example, the urban ring or and then beyond, or how do you keep track of that data? Some of the data that we use and track is through our surveillance system. It's called BEDS. It allows us to really identify where cases are occurring based on home address. We are able to do internally mapping to identify clusters and potential hotspots. That data we can't make public because it involves addresses. We use that as an opportunity to potentially determine different strategies based on the location of those clusters or potential outbreaks. We use them to determine where we may need to identify testing locations and conduct outreach in terms of information and education about COVID, ways to minimize and reduce risk, and certainly minimize spread. There are zip code level data available through a couple of different sites that can be found. It makes it a little challenging because zip codes in Elmorrow County can range from a zip code that includes a large section of Charlottesville and Elmorrow, but its most granular data, I think, would be publicly available for review.\"},\n",
       " {'speaker': 'unknownspeaker',\n",
       "  'text': \"Thank you. Are there other questions from the board? Mr. McKay, perhaps this is stepping outside of what you do, because I know it's very data driven, but I guess, do you do any analysis of risk? I know you mentioned safe's kind of a subjective word and moving target, but we can mitigate risk. And so I guess I'm asking if you have an opinion, which you might not, about, for example, are schools able to mitigate risk in a way that makes it Sorry, I have my screen is making it hard to see. I'm not a fan of these Zoom meetings. I'm like trying to minimize and it's like maximizing, like talking into my blank screen. I guess I'm just asking if there's a way for you to provide an opinion on whether you think that schools are a place where risk would be low or where we could conceivably make risk lower. Do you not do that type of analysis? Because it's hard as a board member and someone without a health background to just see the numbers and feel like we need to make the decision based on the numbers. I would appreciate your opinion if you could provide it. Of course, yes. I believe there are ways that it can be done, and I've seen it. I visited Louisa County Public Schools about two weeks ago and got a tour of their middle and high school from their superintendent, Doug Straley, who showed me every step of the way of how they have worked to minimize and reduce risk to the extent possible, from the screening procedures that they have how they do symptom checks and temperature checks, how they have students enter various parts of the building based on grade level, and how they've cohorted students. Now I will say a lot of what's occurred and what we're hearing is that this is pretty common across Virginia. is that they're able to decompress the number of students who are doing in-person education. So they had about a one-third of parents decide to keep students home for full virtual education, so that left them with two-thirds of their school system attending school in person. I believe they're on an AB schedule. And so while school doesn't look like school in terms of the numbers and what a classroom looks like, they have been very successful at bringing students back, implementing policies such as face masks, putting markers on the floor, stickers on the floor as reminders of how to do physical and social distancing. Six feet can be sort of hard to navigate if you're standing in a line without that visual reference. So the strategies they put in at both levels have been pretty remarkable to see. And I'll be honest, I had a hard time getting my head around what a school looks like during COVID and how you can minimize risk to the extent possible. And they've done a tremendous job. And they've also had some strong protocols as it relates to What happens if we've identified an individual with COVID who's a member of the school community? What do we do in terms of information sharing, contact tracing, and then education following that to ensure that we've identified as public health all the people that may have been a close contact and that we've done everything we can to contain potential spread? And so they've been a very good example. I know Greene County opened a couple of weeks ago. My understanding is Dr. Hawes talked to Andrea Whitmarsh, their superintendent, and we've heard nothing but good things there. In fact, Greene County visited Louisa County just to get an idea of what was happening. And they've been very open about what didn't necessarily work to begin with and what they've adjusted on the fly to make those operations, again, with low risk or minimizing risk to the extent possible. I will say it's important to keep in mind that as schools open, whether it's Albemarle County or Charlottesville or anywhere in Virginia, We have to anticipate there may be a case that emerges, and we have to understand that our response to that is going to impact whether or not we contain spread, mitigate spread, or if spread moves forward. And so that planning process, that constant review of those plans, and learning from others, along with looking at the community data, is going to be an ongoing process. It's evolving. But again, to reiterate to your original question, yes, I believe it can be done in a way that minimizes risk to the extent possible, as long as there's a sort of a systems approach to that in combination with what we can provide and share through data and context around that data. Thank you.\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"Good evening school board members. Thanks Rosalyn for the introduction. So I will jump right into our agenda for today. Our work session will be divided into three sections based on our desired targets. And they are to understand the COVID-19 impacts on the CIP process and current appropriation, to prepare you all for the joint board of supervisors work session that's scheduled for October 21st, And then finally, to provide guidance to the Long-Range Planning Advisory Committee for long-term facilities planning. As you can see, the first part will be for information. I will pause for questions after the first session. And then the second and the third sections really are discussions for you all to discuss amongst each other with staff and the committee members about capital projects. Before we begin, I want to clarify our multi-year CIP process. This is important, particularly this year, as we will be making more decisions than we would in a typical year about capital projects. The first part of the projects are FY 2020, so that's last fiscal year's carry forward projects. So any previously adopted and appropriated projects can be carried over if those projects are not complete into the current FY 21 fiscal year. In a typical year that happens automatically if the project isn't finished, but this year you will see that it wasn't completely automatic. Then we have the FY 2021 capital budget. That's the current year we're in. That budget was adopted last spring and funds for that were appropriated. However, there may be budget amendments in the current year that adjust the budget that was adopted back in the spring based on a better revenue picture that we, not necessarily a better revenue picture, but better revenue information that we will get later this year. Next, we have the FY22 capital budget, which is next year's capital budget. And we plan for that during the budget planning process the year before. So this is the year that we are planning for next year's capital budget. In addition, we will also be planning for, through FY 2025, we will not be adding a fifth year to our previously adopted five-year capital program, CIP, and instead we will just shift forward a year and plan a four-year CIP. That is the current planning. And then the year after that is the fiscal year 23 and beyond period. This is really what we're calling the long-range planning aspect, and this is what the Long-Range Planning Advisory Committee is currently focused on. You may remember that last year we designed a more transparent and streamlined process for the CIP decision-making. We worked very closely with local government and aligned a lot of our meetings and decision points. It was a very successful budget process, and I'm sure you will see this again during the next budget cycle when we plan for FY23. For planning for FY22 purposes, since it is a CIP amendment year and we're in an unusual year, our process will look quite different, and I'll go over that a little bit later. different topic areas. The ones that were approved by the, not approved, but recommended in the County Executive's recommended budget are highlighted here in red. So that's the Crozet addition and improvements and the Mountain View expansion and site improvements. And that recommended budget was put forward in February of 2020, so right before the pandemic. I want to next turn you to an update on where we are with our current budget and appropriation in order to understand the baseline from which we're working from. As you know, our maintenance and replacement program is broken out into three categories. They are school bus facilities and technology, For school bus replacement, our full remaining balance from last year was carried forward. But as you can see, the FY21 budget has been reduced from what was originally recommended in the February budget, the recommended budget. The main change would just be that the replacement cycle for school buses is now delayed. we are able to move forward with a couple essential purchases with the amount that was appropriated. For facilities maintenance, the balance that was remaining from the previous year, some of that was cut with only essential projects moving forward. And that same justification was used to reduce the FY21 budget between the recommended and the adopted. As you can see, technology projects are fully funded at this point. This next list are the one-time CIP projects. The majority of these, as you can see, are FY20 or projects that were previously appropriated. The list that says unfunded, that was the amount that may, in a typical year, be carried forward and reappropriated into the are able to get more information later in the year. The column that- You froze just a minute.\"},\n",

We will get into some of these projects a little bit later, but at the top, you do see the FY20 projects. The FY21 projects is the only project there is the Crozet addition. That project was originally in the recommended budget back in February. But when the budget was revised for adoption, that project was not included. However, the design for that was already funded. So those monies have been appropriated for the current year. So I'm going to turn these next few slides over to Rosalyn.\"},\n",
       " {'speaker': 'rosalynschn',\n",
       "  'text': \"Thank you. So I'm just going to highlight three of those bigger projects just to give you a little more information on them. The first is High School Center 2. As it was stated in that last slide, the design money for that project was carried forward, but the construction as of this point has not. So that's a decision point that the school board and the Board of Supervisors have to make. And I draw your attention to that because as the schedule that we have outlined for that, we have bidding and construction starting next summer. And so what that means is that if this part, the construction money for this project does not get added to the FY21 budget, this project would be delayed. The next slide. Similarly, with the Crozet addition, we do have design underway. Next slide, yeah. Design underway, you will see the design develop, you approve the schematic in July and you'll see the design development portion of that project at your next meeting in October. And as you will see, to keep this project on schedule, we would need to bid and contract in the January, February timeframe of 2021. So again, if the FY21 budget does not get amended to include the construction, which it does not have right now, this project would also be delayed. And then the third project, I just want to keep on our forefront as well as the Mountain View expansion. So that was originally in the recommended CIP for FY 22. And then when everything was revised, it was taken out. So as you recall in Maya's timeline, decisions for this year are going to affect both 21 and 22. So we want to make sure that this project doesn't get lost in the shuffle as well. And I share that all knowing that those are very large projects, and we know that revenues will certainly be uncertain and limited. So we have to be realistic about it. But I did want to make sure that we keep all of these projects, in addition to our maintenance and replacement, restoration on our radar.\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"Thanks, Rosalyn. I'm going to shift gears a little bit now to student enrollment. These numbers here, I'll go through each column, but the first column is showing our original capacity calculations. We have not adjusted those for K-12. The second column here is showing the September 9th actual enrollment data, which was shared with you earlier this month. The third column is showing the the original projections for the current year. So what we thought we were going to get in terms of enrollment for this fall. And then the last column is showing the fifth year of those original projections. The purpose of this is to show you that while our enrollment is lower currently than what we anticipated, and it's still fluctuating every day, there are still some schools that are noted in red where the enrollment does exceed the current capacity. So I'll just give you a minute to look at that. The Red Hill and Scottsville capacities do include the additional space as a result of the current renovations. So looking forward, we have begun the planning process for developing enrollment projections, our 10-year enrollment projections. We have decided at this time, as you know, we are pushing the entire operating budget process. We're delaying that by about a month for each step of the way. So we are going to mirror that in the enrollment projections. That extra time will buy us more time to collect more data and to really look at our methodology to see what will be most appropriate to move forward with these projections. I think most importantly, we will be working with a lot of our partners, which we have previously, but there will be a special focus on this year. So that'll be the Weldon Cooper Center, who we've worked with in the past to develop enrollment projections. We will make sure to connect with principals and OAs who know the most what's happening in their schools and their communities. We're gonna do a deep dive with the Long-Range Planning Advisory Committee about what our methodology will be. And as always, we will partner closely with the Community Development Department and local gov, and we will turn to industry best practices or as much as they can be developed throughout this fall and winter. We will do a deep analysis by school, by grade level, by feeder patterns to really determine, to really understand what happened this year, and we will do as much data collection as we possibly can. And then finally, we will. Flex where we are currently and then an upper end that better reflects our status quo where we would have been before the pandemic. And again, the focus for the range will be that we may use a different set of projections, whether it's for operating resource allocations for the short term, or whether it's facilities planning for the long term. We'll sort of need that wiggle room and that range to really make the best decisions. So that's the first part of the agenda to understand where we are and what's happening.

In November, the CIP Advisory Committee that was formed last year will convene and make a recommendation to the County Executive for consideration for his recommended budget.

So these are all going to be sort of discussed and considered as a whole group, which is a change from previous years.

So I think group one should start and maybe just take two minutes to tell the rest of the school board and the public a little bit about what was discussed. So Jono, you want to take it away? Oh, you're muted. But anyway, let me just come in and squint. If it can be enlarged, that'd be great. But So in terms of what we were looking at for our focus for this year's budget, we talked about a lot of things. Maybe I can't read, but I'm you know, focus on Center 2. If it's going to be early capacity, there's an importance to Crozet Elementary and to Mountain View because they're busting at the seams. And so, let me just take that down. And it all came down to money for, well, for me, that if we had the money to work with in order to work on capacity. That if we didn't, no, we would work on capacity. But if we didn't, then potentially modernization of our existing facilities could be a place to put our CIP money for a year and hopefully get back up to to the regular numbers. But the number one thing and the big idea of it was we got to solve capacity issues. We talked about a number of things in there. One of the reasons for the school center too was that it was promised in the 2016 school referendum because if we all remember that was In addition to the Woodbrook project, it was the big project to be able to provide a relief from a capacity for Albemarle High School and Western Albemarle High School. And they were still going to need that capacity release. And one point that was made that was so important is that space is increasingly important. during the pandemic because of the spacing needs. And if we don't have the capacity, we can't do that. And if we could just slide it over, I can see what that last line was. Or is this the last we had? Yeah, that's it. OK.\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"Group two? I can speak if you want. I can't read Ellen's face or Graham. Do you all want to speak? No, we'll let you. Go ahead. Unless Ellen wants to speak. No, go ahead. So I would say, I think on the Jono's slide, group one slide, the big idea was solving capacity issues. And I think we would be in agreement with that for this year, given that there are so many unknowns and uncertainty and whether there's even going to be any money forthcoming, that would be the focus that we had is just making sure we have space for our students in our most overcrowded areas. That being said, We, well, we had topics for the long range planning. So that's actually for the next section. We did have a few discussions. Center two was not as high on our priority list overall. We also, a little contrary to what group one said about how spacing is increasingly important. We actually were having some conversations about how schooling might look different in the future, given the long range impacts of COVID and virtual learning and the opportunities that have kind of opened up with that. And so I think in our minds, we were kind of, focusing more on the elementary schools. And I would be remiss if I didn't say it's particularly in the Southern Peter Patrick. Graham. So I hope that's a good one minute summary. If anyone wants to add anything else on, they may. All right, thank you. I think both groups were starting to talk More long range because I think in some cases that's the long range is more certain than the short term, which is really backwards, but I so it's a really good point to I think go to the next part of our work session. So our last part of the discussion, again, will be with the Long-Range Planning Advisory Committee members. I want to thank those that are here. They have been online since the beginning of the meeting at 6.30, so thank you. Just as a quick reminder, the Long-Range Planning Advisory Committee exists to inform and advise both the school board and the superintendent in developing a long-term facilities planning needs. Over on the right, you see some examples of the topics that they are charged with. If you want to get a sense of the scope, you can see the scope is pretty large and creative. And I know that group one even started talking about some of that. So I think that this year, this committee is going to be very important in providing you with recommendations next summer. But to begin with, the committee is looking for you all to provide guidance to them as we just started meeting for the school year. We will meet for the full school year and come back to you with whatever guidance that you have given them. Here are the members most, I think, present. So if you all could maybe unmute and, whoops, unmute and turn your videos on and just give a quick introduction to yourself to both the school board and the public, so that we know who you are for those in attendance today. We can go down this order, but is Kate on? Kate Package? Don't. No. Okay.\"},\n",

Also the capacity issues, once we follow out with what happens with both. Crozet and Mountain View, and then looking at whatever else comes next with that. Second piece was modernizing our existing facilities, both to take advantage of modern technology, modern teaching techniques, but also to be able to deal with whatever the next Black Swan event is, whatever the next pandemic type thing might be, so we can be better prepared if we can, right? So it's just one of those things. And then lastly, to try and do it with an eye toward equity to make sure that all our students are getting the best opportunity they can to start once they get into that building, once they get into whatever facility we happen to be using for them, so that we're not, everybody's got the best opportunity to succeed.\"},\n",

And we also talked about flexibility for the future, if that, you know, is sort of out of the box thinking in terms of mixing virtual learning with in-person learning, possibly as a way to solve capacity issues.

I think probably our highest priority was looking at capacity, but really more focused on Mountain View, which is almost 800 students. And looking at last year, the Long Range Planning Committee talked about a middle school study. It was on our to-do list. We haven't done it. But with Mountain View, close to 700 students, And without space to expand, we actually do need to tackle that problem area at some point. So that's what is the right size for elementary schools? What are we going to do about Mountain View? And how does that fit in with the study of our middle schools? And then because I think there's an opportunity to look prospectively, it is long range planning. is I would like the Long Range Planning Committee to consider looking at the Lambs Lane campus. It is with the school with Albemarle, Greer, Jack Jewett, and soon to be a Boys and Girls Club. It has terrible traffic patterns. It has both the transportation and gas station and building services. But there's an opportunity, I think, to rethink that campus and look at what it could be, even if it's not tomorrow, if it's a 10-year plan. How could we improve that campus and maybe take advantage of some of the parcels that we have proffered to the county and the schools? So it'd be a solve these problems and here's prospectively something we can build on. So in short, pretty easy. Yeah, yeah.\"},\n",

Yeah, absolutely. I really appreciate your question. So the group that has access to that is the Human Resources Equity Team, and more broadly, the Human Resources Department. And how they're using that information right now, I would tell you, is even in thinking about recruitment and interviews, how are we really being intentional about the questions that we're asking, who we're recruiting. And then also just starting to think about next step related to practices and policies and thinking about just more how their own biases may be impacting the screening process. And so there are a lot of conversations right now about what are the next steps in that regard. And in particular, doing some more you know, qualitative assessments with current educators of color so that we can better understand what are some of the barriers. And I kind of alluded to this a little bit, but even in the exit survey, thinking about how we are reworking some of that language to allow for more feedback. So just an example would be, what more could we do to better affirm your race and ethnicity in our schools, right? those types of questions that would allow for more feedback. But, you know, I would also just put this out there, Chair Page, that one thing we have talked a lot about very candidly is being cognizant that for educators of color, they often feel the pressure And sometimes even the fear of it, that there may be retaliation if they are too honest, right? Or that they may be boxed out out of opportunities to advance. And, you know, that's not on them, right? It's not on them to have to feel like they need to speak out. It's on us as an organization. And so we're really spending more time thinking about what does that look like for every step of the way, right? What does it look like when we're onboarding them? What does it look like once they are in the buildings? and how can we better support them, not just to come to work at ACPS, but to retain them over time. Thank you. Very good. Thanks. Are there other questions? Well, thank you, Dr. Harriston and Ms. Fernandez for your excellent report. And I see that the next update is, what, September? Was that right? May.

      "judyle: I have a couple questions about virtual learning. First, I want to say I do appreciate all of the work and planning that's gone into this. I know that we're not dealing with unlimited resources and we have to make a lot of really difficult decisions to educate 14,000 students. So I really appreciate all the work that staff has done and definitely the people on the ground who are doing every day. So I really appreciate that. I just have a concern about the equity between the virtual learning and the hybrid learning. Also because we know nationally and locally that more of our black and brown families are choosing that. So I just want to make sure that we have some assurances. It will be important to me that we have some assurances that that is robust for my decision making. Firstly, I have a question about intervention services. And I think a way for me to be able to get my head around this is to know how many students will lose intervention services in stage four as it is now. And I know that you don't have those numbers ready, but that's something that I would like to know next week. Also, I would like to know how instructional hours for the hybrid learners will compare with the instructional hours of the virtual learners in K-3, or pre-K-3, I guess, for the four-day-a-week students. I assume that the 4-5, 4-12, I guess, would be the same. But I just would like to know the difference, if there is any difference between the instructional time for those youngest learners. And then I also would like to know how if or how meal services will be affected. For the students who are at home. And then on a different note, I don't know if this is something that Ross considers or we consider how this works. But I wonder if we should be looking at updated mask guidance, given that the new variant is likely coming or here. I know that we've all read a lot in the news about how the single cloth masks are just not as effective now against that. So that's just something I guess I'll throw out there.<|eot_id|>\n",

They and one of the things that I know that they many of them talked about is just, you know, helping them understand the mitigation strategies for some of the teachers. They haven't been in the school since since March. And so, you know, encouraging them to come in, see the mitigation strategies in action, kind of kind of make that first step into the school, I think, is a really important piece. And and one of the things that I know about our principals is they have very, very good and strong relationships with their staff. And we know that they can talk to them and help calm and ease their nerves. I think the fact that we have not seen a number of people say, no, I just can't do this. I think that's an indication that while they are uncomfortable, and I don't want to in any way minimize that. We know that we have a number of people that are uncomfortable coming back into school.

And we are looking at returning to the regular extended enrichment after school program services pending the school board's decision. Thank you. There are other questions from the board. One more. What do we know about preserving current teacher-student relationships? Will there be lots of switching around of teachers and students?\n",
      "debbiecollins: We anticipate some shifts as we saw with the pre-K through three. Because we just changed semesters for our middle and high schooler, there was a lot of conversation, a lot of preemptive work done in those situations. So I would say yes to our four through eight. There's more possibilities for them to switch students than the other students. But again, that's one of the things that the principals are working very closely with parents on and making sure that we're listening and developing and continuing to nurture the relationships with students and teachers.<|eot_id|>\n",

      "matthewhaa: I've heard some great stories from students and families about the creativity of the teachers and how they figured out. Some of the students have had some of the best experiences they've ever had during this time. And many students really adjusted well to a different format for school. It was almost like a break that they needed. So one of the challenges that we talk about at our level is as we make these kinds of plans, we have to leave enough room for the creativity of our teachers, our families, and our students to be part of the idea generating process and the iteration of what a class is gonna look like because that's where engagement comes from. planning this out with enough detail to make sure everyone is safe and that everyone will be treated fairly and have the best access that they can is our job. And then allowing that level of creativity to come in from the school level principals, the teachers, and the families and students, that's where you get the engagement.\n",

      "deboracollin: One of the things this kind of work allows us to do, if we have secondary students and not all the students are in the building at the same time, there could be groups of students that could come in every day. So English language learners could come in every day based on the kinds of scheduling we're looking at. They have been identified as high-risk learners. And all the task force documents from DOE, our task force, they're identified as a priority. So we would try to get them into school buildings as much as possible for as many days during the week as we could. So those become priorities for us. And as we start thinking about how we schedule, we look to those kind of principles, if you will, to help us decide.<|eot_id|>\n",

I mean, I assume that these are the same mitigation efforts that were in place at that time during summer school when there were considerably fewer children in the school and we had those six cases so. I guess I'm interested in stronger language and stronger policy or stronger action around lunch, because it seems like an unmasked time. I was a little dismayed to hear that people will be eating in their classrooms, because when they talked about alpha transmission, it was like 15 minutes.

And at that point, we will begin reaching out to those who are not vaccinated to start the process of getting their weekly tests or getting the process to be vaccinated. I wanna encourage all of our employees, if you are listening tonight or if anyone reads The news released tomorrow that if you are not vaccinated, that please contact our human resources department to start that conversation and start that process.

Virginia code section 22.1-22.3 enacted in 2020 requires all local school boards to adopt a policy regarding the treatment of transgender students by the start of the 21-22 school year. that is consistent with or more comprehensive than the policy guidance published by the Virginia Board of Education as mandated by the statute. The ACPS proposed policy is aligned with the Virginia Code. VDOE guidance and the holding of the United States Supreme, sorry about that, United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Grimm versus Gloucester County School Board that allows transgender students to utilize the bathroom and other facilities that correspond with their gender identities. This policy was presented to the school board at its meeting on Thursday, July 8th, 2021. On July 28th, 2021, the ACPS conducted an informational session for the community following which the ACPS published FAQs, responded in writing to questions that were asked and reviewed and considered comments submitted to the school board. The draft policy before you now for approval contains a change prompted by concern Mr. Oberg raised at the last meeting. Mr. Oberg requested that the policy make clear that implementation of the policy and resolution of issues that may arise there under will be the responsibility of the entire ACPS, including counselors, nurses, principals, and other administrators, and not classroom teachers alone. This addition is contained in the final section of the policy that discusses training and professional development. If you have any questions or concerns you would like me to address at this time, I'd be happy to do so. And I appreciate your time and consideration.<|eot_id|>\n",

And so our plan is once we start bringing all the furniture back that's from storage, right, and we will integrate those desks into some of these plans or upper grades. We have very intentionally purchased adjustable heights so they can be used in both elementary and secondary.

I do have a problem with saying like, oh, this is not really, it's hard to quantify because two of the things you talked about were quantities. So I do, and this might not actually be for one principle to answer, but more for the division central office staff about how we can show that this type of funding does make a difference. Because I haven't seen any of the goals that we've had move. We haven't been able to move toward our goals in the 20 some years that we've had this type of staffing. I'm just, I'm curious how we can hold ourselves accountable to those goals. I'm not sure if that question is directed towards New York central staff. I'm happy. More like central staff. Okay.

      "matthewhaa: Thank you, Steve. Thank you for the presentation, Steve. I really appreciate it. And thank you, Miss Lee. What I think is that we can demonstrate using the staffing at the schools. We may not see from year to year perhaps great gains in achievement, whereas achievement is measured one time per year with one test, with an SOL test. However, all of our schools demonstrate growth for their students, particularly students that are behind, even with the SOLs. Ever since Virginia introduced growth as a measure for SOL testing, many of our schools have maintained the very rigorous standards for accreditation by showing growth with their students. I know that when Dr. Saunders was principal at Baker Butler, the way he really began to develop the success of the school was first through growth. And then that led to eventually the Blue Ribbon Award for the school around closing achievement gaps. Much of that accomplished with differentiated staffing at the school. I believe the same thing will happen at Greer. And I believe that as we focus more on growth, which is really a measure of a student moving from where they are at the beginning of the year to the middle of the year to the end of the year, that's where we're going to see the gains that we have. Ultimately, a student coming into school who is behind, who's had interrupted education, or perhaps comes from another nation where they have not been to school at all, they have to make more rapid growth than a typical student. And so I think it's incumbent upon the division, as you said, to develop a way to see that growth and make it more transparent to our community. I fully support what you said, what you suggested. The growth is there. Our students are more successful. They learn a great deal during the year. And we owe it to our teachers and our community to celebrate those successes. Right now, we are holding ourselves accountable to a static one-time-per-year measure. We really need to focus on growth.<|eot_id|>\n",

      "katrinacallsen: And if I could jump on and say, I agree with Judy. And also, in the past, while I don't disagree with using differentiated staffing, I think there needs to be more guidance about what it's used for. The presentation that we just heard sounded like a great use, but if we have determined that it's beneficial to students in this position to have an extra counselor, then that should just be what the standard is. And I'll tell you the specific incident that comes to mind. I'm pretty sure I don't want to throw a school under a bus, but I went to a school that had differentiated staffing. They were using it for a music teacher or an art teacher, which is fine, but I didn't know. We give a lot of flexibility. And I don't want to say that I don't like people having autonomy over their schools, but at some point, if the point of this staff or this money is to help with the achievement gap and with student performance, I don't know. I just would want, I'd want almost, I hesitate to say, but almost more uniformity. If not uniformity, then at least cause it like a direct correlation between whatever decision you're making and why you're doing it and how it ties in and that to be more apparent and obvious. Because now I know a lot about what career is doing, but I don't necessarily know about all the other schools.\n",
      "matthewhaa: So annually, schools develop a strategic improvement plan for their school. Over time, we have become more and more centralized and consistent across the school division around what the goals are for the school based on their growth and achievement from the year before. That's highly structured. All of those are available transparently on our school division's webpage, and they can be accessed from each individual school.\n",
      "katrinacallsen: And Matt, I think I brought this same question up the last time we went through the budget cycle, only I worded it slightly different, which was just, do you provide oversight and are counseling with the principals to help them when they're making these decisions? And I believe you had answered yes at that point. So at that, I will yield and just say, I agree with Judy in the fact that, you know, is maybe it's time to, tie it to metrics or look at there's other models or something else we've been doing a long time.

      "matthewhaa: What happens next is after they've made their school improvement plans and as they work their way through the year we have mid year review. Right after mid year review is where we begin to do the staffing process for the coming year schools are assigned staffing as well as differentiated staffing they develop. staffing plan that's in alignment with their school improvement goals for the coming year. They come to the central office with that plan. They meet with a team, including members of our equity staff, our deputy superintendent for instruction, personnel staff, and finance staff. to ensure that the staffing plan that they've developed will align with their school improvement goals to meet the growth goals as well as the achievement goals that they have for the school. It is a shame that after the, as we made our way through the 18-19 school year and really firmed up these procedures and became more consistent than ever, that we came into a pandemic. And many principals have, really been struck by the fact that they were making great progress during the 18-19 school year and 19-20 school year. We could see the growth. And so we have really been thrown off by the past two years of the pandemic. I am looking for next year to be a year of great growth for our students as they return. And I hope the board understands that We do not just sprinkle staffing around the school system, leave it up to the principals to do what they want with it, and then hope for the best of success. It is far more organized, it is far more resource-oriented, and it's targeted toward meeting students' needs. Thank you.\n",

So my goal at some point would be some like outside looking into how we're doing and how differentiated staffing is actually working at our division. I know Kate had asked for some information about differentiated staffing and we received it. We received some research from EAD and some information about other schools, but I'm really interested in how it's working at our schools and again, whether tying it to.

So I think a lot of that can be tied to the differentiated staffing in the way that he uses it. So the growth scores that Greer has had over time is higher than the growth in any other school. So we can start, and I think that that's part of what we need to be more transparent with is those gross scores so that we can tie those to schools that get the additional staffing.\n",
      "grahampaige: So Ms. Collins, will that be something then that we'll be able to see in reports in some type of way so that we can see the tie between what Ms. Lee is talking about and the differentiated staffing?\n",
      "deboracollin: We're able to do that if the state provides the numbers in the way that it shows the growth. So the schools, the principals, because we do a lot of hand scoring of those pieces, can provide that. So actually, we'll talk to Dr. McGlaw often about how we might be able to show that in tables and charts better.\n",
      "unknownspeaker: Is there a resource out there right now that identifies how each school is using their differentiated staffing, what extra staff members they've hired, and why? Can you send that to me?\n",

      "katrinacallsen: Yeah, and I don't need, I mean, I don't need to have access to whatever central set like the slide that Mr Saunders had where he just like kind of quickly said where how many extra staff he gets and where he's using it. That would be helpful for each school that's using it, because I want to see where there's variance and why he's doing so yeah if I get that that'd be great.\n",

I'd be interested in the demographics of who's choosing to do the program one fear I have is that we're only catering to specific students or family so I spent a long time since we had the presentation on this program I don't even know if that was part of the discussion but you know like. Now we have enough schools that are doing it, presumably we can get some aggregated data about which families are selecting, because it's optional, right? So which families are selecting to do this program and who are we serving? It's a big investment.\n",
      "laurenmacle: We can collect that but i'll also add that in many of our schools we're seeing it more as a and everybody is included in less there. they'd like not to be just because there is so much interest, so I know that some of our schools pivoted kind of looking at which grade levels receive different levels of support to ensure that all of the students across a great level could receive that instruction.\n",
      "unknownspeaker: Any other questions for Ms. McClain?\n",
      "callsen: Yeah, I'm sorry to speak up then, but I'm like trying to piece that together in my head. So I guess, like I said, it's been a long time since this presentation. I know that we have the immersion program at Mountain View and maybe one other school. So this staffing is more like to have a language teacher at the school that's like going into classrooms and doing a language class with each. It is not the immersion program. Are we maintaining the immersion program at any schools?\n",
      "laurenmacle: So the immersion program is being maintained at Mountain View, but in terms of what the foreign language teacher is doing, it's less about them going in to teach the language and more about them actually teaching and teaching content in that language to support students in learning language and the grade level content simultaneously.<|eot_id|>\n",

Can you move to the next slide, please? That came up during Dr. Haas's budget proposal. So I'm here tonight to highlight how the SEL counselors help enhance the school counseling program through a combined focus on mental health and social emotional learning. Next slide please. This graphic shows the overlap of some of our school-based mental health professionals. First, I'd like to talk about our school counselors. They are state-licensed school counselors who focus on three core domains, academics, career, and social-emotional learning. Then we have, due to the school board support, we have added our SEL counselors who come from a variety of backgrounds. So they have licensed professional school counselors, social workers, et cetera. So these positions were implemented to be in conjunction with our school counselors to help each school support our students social emotional learning based on feedback from teachers, parents, community members, and administrators from the pandemic. So I hope this helps clarify the distinction between our SEL counselors and our school counselors.\n",

      "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "milesnelson: Yeah, absolutely. So the school counselors have a broad range of backgrounds. So for example, at the high school level, they are focused on the three domains. So you have academics, career, and social emotional. So school counselors are well equipped to handle students' social emotional needs in schools, but they also have other duties. So at the high schools, they also help with course registration. They talk students through career counseling also. So helping them process and work through all the different steps of courses that they're going through with high school in collaboration with families. And so there's a lot of different responsibilities that school counselors oversee. And so the social emotional counselor is an extra support built in to help meet the needs of all the social emotional needs that we've seen built up over the last two years. So the social emotional counselor doesn't have that three domains, they really focus in on the one domain. And so they are in conjunction support of the school counselors. And so it's a big teaming effort at all three levels. Does that make it a little bit more clear? Yep, thanks.<|eot_id|>\n",

Having said that, all employees' salaries who are making on the lower end of the wage scale, everyone will be lifted, just not necessarily to the 15 if you're a part-time VRS-ineligible employee. So the next phase would include all employees, so we would be raising the part-time VRS ineligible scale to $15 and that would continue to push up the people who were already at 15. So that they wouldn't get compressed because we have two different pay scales for those groups and they have to have a differential between them due to VRS reasons.

Because like someone like me, I did a bunch of research early on, and then it turns out all that's wrong. So, you know, a lot has evolved. And I was just wondering how we're communicating that or if we can.\n",
      "ryanmckay: We certainly can communicate that in fact that will be one of our big points of highlighted tomorrow in our newsletter that goes out each week. So, obviously things that are high filtration and 95s KN95s KN94s are going to be the ones that are most successful at preventing spread but also protecting the person who's wearing it. surgical masks offer a little higher protection for individuals and certainly for those wearing them than cloth masks. I do think the key point that Eileen mentioned is that it's really about comfort level with the mask. Is it a mask that a student, particularly younger students in elementary schools, are going to be good with wearing throughout the entire day, aside from when they're eating, when they're drinking, when they need a little bit of a break. And because we want to make sure that they're comfortable so that they do wear that all day long. KN95s or KN94s for children are going to be a little bit more difficult. They take a lot longer to get used to. The breathability obviously is going to be a little more challenging. And that's sort of the trade off when you use those for protection. I do think it's a great idea that teachers have access and staff have access to the KN95s. They're going to be able to adjust to that a little bit better than obviously the students will. And we are looking at procuring through a donor. between 20 and 30,000 masks that we would distribute to schools of varying sizes so that they could be distributed to elementary students, middle and high school, for those that don't have access, but also as another way of protection that schools can use to mitigate spread.<|eot_id|>\n",

And then we would begin to start to see things falling. A lot of this is just based on their analysis, but we're also beginning to see potentially the peak coming down in areas where it hit before us. So the Northeast, New York City and Washington DC have seen significant drops in cases. We're lagging a little bit behind them.

I think on Sunday, there were 89 total in the hospital at UVA Health. I also know that Cintero and Martha Jefferson are seeing the most cases they've seen. I'm not sure what that means in terms of ICU beds being occupied for individuals with COVID. But one thing they're also seeing, and it's sort of hard separate the two right now, which is people who are in the hospital due to COVID and the health outcomes that they're experiencing versus those that are in the hospital for something else and also have COVID. And so it's a little bit of a difference there, but hospital capacity they're managing, but that means there's not much wiggle room for other things. Sentara came out and said, I think it was last week that they're no longer doing elective surgeries and procedures. So that's an indication of sort of the burden that's on the hospitals. And there's always a lag when it comes to hospitalizations and COVID. It's about one to two weeks when we begin to see what that looks like from our current situation to what that means for the hospitals. So it is a strain. Their staffing is strained. We're going into year three and their staff are extremely tired. And so it is a challenge. What we heard on Monday is that they're managing it and we'll see where we go from here.<|eot_id|>\n",

And as Dr. Kaiser mentioned, these clinics are being done in partnership with the Charlottesville City Schools along with the Regional Emergency Operations Center. I was on site all day and just the true collaboration and teamwork pulled this off. So we received logistics support from our public safety and emergency management colleagues. We had staff volunteers from administrators to various departments and schools, all levels of organizations serving as our registrars, our screeners, our assistants, traffic control that made this event possible. Most importantly, our school nurses in conjunction with nurses from the city went through training and became our vaccinators. Again, it was just truly a site of collaboration and teamwork that went smoothly today, and we look forward to the next two days. So this initial clinic was at Charlottesville High School. Our plan is to do a site at Monticello High School as soon as next week, assuming doses are available. And for now, we will operate one site at a time, switching between the two, but it is our goal that we would ultimately have both up and running. to get through the remainder of our employees and then second doses as well. So I know employees are anxious to know when the next one will be.

That said, I know that there's a lot of internal things going on. For example, If there's a, I'll just use for an example, let's say that there is a fifth grade team and they have a fifth grade teacher out while they're virtual, they may be teaching a little bit differently.

I think a teacher in a classroom has infinitely more impact than something that you buy or that you give them. It's all about the people.

And I'm kind of curious how we're going to be making decisions and what decisions we're gonna be making to bring things back or expand, if that makes sense. Like, you know, like we haven't hired in certain things. Do we need to hire positions that we didn't fill when they left? Those kinds of decisions. I'm curious to thinking that we're doing around that. Dave, I'm looking at you. I'm frustrated.<|eot_id|>\n",

But I think we need we think we need to be more bold and our goals for teacher compensation. Maya did a back of the envelope calculation.

There's a huge diversity across our school division. And so my question is really at the board level. I know we just had a session that talked about differentiated staffing, but to sort of modify your games from cooperative to competitive learning. It's hugely time consuming within a class. So I know we reduce class sizes and we have some differentiated staffing to help address that. I'm just wondering if our approach is refined enough to deal with the students we have across the various schools. I beat this drum a lot, but. And it's not a question that can be answered tonight probably, but that's my concern. Is there a bigger challenge in a school with 60% black and Hispanic students versus one that has 10% and how does that change or does it change or does it intensify the approach? I don't know.

We fortunately just received notice today, as a matter of fact, from the delivery company that they will arrive at our office by 4 p.m. on Monday. As you know, our order that we placed in July was out of stock in the United States and is coming from China. And we were unable to track it. Apple could not give us any kind of tracking information. So we've been operating completely in the dark, but did get word today. So we have already plans in place to have staff working every night next week until 10 p.m. to try to process those as quickly as we can. There's 1,660 of them, and it's a slow process to get them into our inventory, into the cases, and assigned to students in buildings.

      "christinediggs: We feel like we can finish by next week, the end of next week. The challenge we have right now is that we have very limited staff that's based centrally that we know we can pull during the day to do the work. We can't really pull our building-based staff right now from supporting their schools and parents and students. They're on site in our buildings, but they're also fielding phone calls that come in to help kind of offload from our service desk. So without having really the full availability of our staff to also help process these, we can only do it after hours. Right now, I can't predict how many folks are available after hours to come in after a long day of supporting families and students. It's a little unpredictable right now, but our goal is to have them processed by next Friday. And if we can deliver before that, we absolutely will. And I know building services is ready and they're on call on standby that if we get some ready, they'll be able to help deliver for us, which will be a help that we won't have to also be delivering.<|eot_id|>\n",

So now they're going to have to work through the, there's five different options, right? There's five different carriers.

And it's an educated guest, but it's still a guest in terms of cell signal from their home location.

And then, um, I was also hoping with the survey to attach like an introduction either in like a paragraph form or video form. of just like who I am, what my role is. And then I thought that was a really good opportunity to introduce the next representative, but I'm not really sure how to coordinate all of that, but I, that's something I'm hoping to do.\n",

Thankfully, you won't hear too much from me this evening, but I will provide an introduction and close up at the end. This is the third of a series of three work sessions focused on special topics in our funding request. We're happy to continue receiving written questions after tonight and throughout the continuing budget process in April and May. Our agenda for this evening is as follows. Mr. Kevin Kirst will present the student safety coaches proposal, followed by Dr. Bernard Hairston's presentation on the equity expansion. You'll see in both of their presentations an adherence to a logic model that we've established in order to ensure timely implementation of the proposals, monitor our activities, and provide a means to ensure, to measure results and impacts of these new programs. These metrics aren't set in stone, but rather serve as guidelines for moving the proposals forward. As you'll see, the metrics are continually being refined in the same way that our proposals are continuously being improved. After the proposal presentations, I'll review some of our one-time expenditures for fiscal year 22. And then finally, I will provide a summary of our revisions since the draft funding request was presented, including an adjustment to the KTEC transfer. And with that, I will turn things over to Mr. Kirst.<|eot_id|>\n",

We are reviewing what the employees will see for plan year 23, which is the second half of fiscal year 23. So that's still under review. And so what we'll do is we will work with our consultant to look at our final numbers and our final medical expenses and those cost drivers and ask them to help us with their actuarial of magic machinery to help us to project what the expected expenses are. Obviously, you know, we're kind of dealing with a moving target here because those plain claims do have 24 months to hit our actual expenses. So, I'm cautiously optimistic that we will be able to maintain that, but there may be in plain, 23, there may be an adjustment to the plan rate for employees based on what the consultants share with us and what we experience.\n",

There hasn't been any change in the past at least five years that I'm aware of. And so there would be plenty of communication. And I believe that Mr. Redding and Ms. Cloutier would be heavily involved in that effort if there were a change. I certainly want to. be optimistic, but we also understand that it may not be exactly fiscally responsible to keep that at a flat rate for more than six or seven years. We're really reviewing, and along with the comp and benefit study, we're going to include that data with what we're doing here for the healthcare fund to make sure that we're equitable and to make sure that we're in line with what the market is doing as far as premium rates are concerned.\n",
      "claudinecloutier: I can add on a little bit to this this question if you were to assess premium rate increases those would occur on January 1 of next year and typically we plan to have everything. And we should have everything known by the time open enrollment rolls around, which is in early November each year. So our goal throughout the year as we do this is to have final decisions made by September so that we have our final fund recommendations and our premium recommendations approved by the steering committee. And then at that point in time, we can start communicating out with employees. So in theory, we could be communicating by the end of September, early October, because normally I spend the month of October really talking a lot about what's coming for the new year as people prepare for open enrollment.<|eot_id|>\n",

But with Mountain View, close to 700 students, And without space to expand, we actually do need to tackle that problem area at some point. So that's what is the right size for elementary schools? What are we going to do about Mountain View? And how does that fit in with the study of our middle schools? And then because I think there's an opportunity to look prospectively, it is long range planning. is I would like the Long Range Planning Committee to consider looking at the Lambs Lane campus. It is with the school with Albemarle, Greer, Jack Jewett, and soon to be a Boys and Girls Club. It has terrible traffic patterns. It has both the transportation and gas station and building services. But there's an opportunity, I think, to rethink that campus and look at what it could be, even if it's not tomorrow, if it's a 10-year plan. How could we improve that campus and maybe take advantage of some of the parcels that we have proffered to the county and the schools?

I would tend to lean toward the arguments that Dr. Acuff made about just keeping our immunocompromised and ineligible students and their families safe. So I feel like we've been in this position before where we all had hope and I am just very concerned about Child of Omicron. son of other Greek letter coming at us. And I just, I want to make sure that that doesn't catch us flat footed. So my tendency would be to keep the masking for now and see if we really can get rid of it at some point.

All right, I too would be in favor of right now remaining without teachers and staff continuing to wear masks because of all of the unknown factors that everyone else has cited here. And also, I think most of our students are still wearing masks, even though it's not really required. So until maybe we have, I would like to receive a recommendation maybe from the Health Advisory Committee, and then we can probably use that to help us make a decision on this.

And I think we wrote it into our school board evaluation that we would do better metrics. And I feel like this will meet it. And I will say personally, I do really well when there's accountability for myself.

There will be timelines established by which it must be done. And if it's not done by those timelines, then there will be some some expectations or reprimands for not adhering to our expectations.

I also appreciate the equity dashboard and I sent this as a message late into the night last night about the equity dashboard is that I think that, you know, Patrick the way that you explained it in terms of, you know, when you see when you compare it to the student population then you can see that there is an equity. But I think that the way that we present that data obscures the magnitude of that inequity and I am not suggesting that that's purposeful but I think that that can be an outcome of that. What I did appreciate about this presentation that you gave tonight was that you did have that one slide. that showed the actual disparity with like the 77% of reading and whatever 65% of whatever the math, I think. And then, so you could see, really, where the big disparities were and truly the magnitude of them and so I just think that while our equity dashboard does share the type of information and the actual real numbers, and I do appreciate that, I think that when they're calculated based on the whole, and you have to do the math of like, okay, so this is 4%, but there are 7%. So you have to sort of think, you just have to do a lot of backward math to figure out what the true magnitude of the disparity is.

And I think we need to put that out there openly. This isn't compelling or particularly optimistic to hear tonight. Knowing that we have out of three high schools, only six black students that took the SAT, is upsetting. It's hard to hear. I feel like I could personally, I feel like with as much effort as we're putting in, we're willing to pay for that safety. We should just, I mean, have a class and make it.

      "katrinacallsen: And that's worth noting, but I also want to say it's not all SATs. That was just a striking number to say. It's like back to the table where we were showing all the metrics and showing growth. And it's growth, so that's good. But I just want to call attention that at that rate, it will be a whole generation that is missed and beyond. So hopefully we can continue with urgency and know that it's important.

      "patrickmclauchlin: Well, just a quick update on that is that we also give the PSATs to all of our students in 10th and 11th grade. And by taking the PSAT, that opens up personalized free SAT prep through the Khan Academy for any student with a college board account. So again, that barrier has been greatly diminished. to get that prep and it's likely, I think, better than, you know, the old Kaplan courses that that we used to offer to kids at incredible expense.\n",

In light of the fact that our employees have been and are going above and beyond the call of duty during a very challenging time and they are facing many challenges of their own, including the highest increase in inflation in 30 years that we've seen. I'm recommending to the school board that we provide a one-time payment in December for all staff members in the amount of $1,000 to all regular staff from one FTE to 0.7 FTE and $750 for all regular staff that work less than 0.7 FTE. To be eligible, I recommend that employees must be employed before November 30th, 2021 and receive a December 2021 paycheck. I am certain that such a payment will signal to our workforce how much they are appreciated and how valuable their presence and their work with our students, families, and each other are to their community.\n",

Employees must be employed before November 30th, 2021 and receive a December 2021 paycheck. And after making my motion, I will say that I think this is not only appropriate from a from a morale circumstance, from an inflation standpoint, but because we are changing the way paychecks are going as a result of, you know, our filing the county, my hope is that this will help ease some of that pain, because it will be a pain for some of our employees with that change.

And so there is, their stance is it's a county decision. So there are some divisions that have required students to wear a mask, and there's others that haven't. I think one of the governor's executive orders says that the athletes and students participating in athletics and things like that do not have to wear masks. So it's, you know, most of the school systems I understand when I'm meeting this morning are not wearing masks. There are some schools in northern Virginia some other places that are asking their kids to wear a mask to participate. Mr. Thomas what is our county policy or does it vary from one school to another with this. With the wearing of the mask? Yes. So with the wearing of the mask, we have procedures in place that coaches have to have masks on at all time, that the students have masks on unless they're actually competing or exercising. If they're on the sideline or resting, they would have their masks on.\n",

But for me, it's hard to get my head around saying that our buildings are not safe for students who have insufficient internet access or who have special needs. or our English language learners, or who we have identified as disengaged. But those that are buildings are not safe for them, who we would have in stage two, but they're safe enough for these activities where the respiration is higher. So to me, and for people looking for voluntarily going into the buildings, that's what stage two offers as well. So for me, it would make more sense to couple it with stage two. I'm not sure. We seem to go from three to one and I don't, I guess we're not really doing two anymore and I don't know if there are major logistical problems with that. For me, the voluntary part of it is not as compelling an argument because the surge, most of the post-holiday COVID surges have been from people doing voluntary activities. And that does affect the rest of the community, not least of which the very taxed healthcare system, which, you know, that data we use in determining stages. So for me, I feel like taking it, doing this during stage one carries with it a lot of cognitive dissonance for me.<|eot_id|>\n",

The one thing that does the federal government does do is it sets aside the second dose.

Um, it's like snow days on steroids, but the, the alternative for that is. for the families who just, hey, look, my child can't handle that inconsistency is virtual learning. They don't have to do hybrid. And so I get it. For my family, I chose virtual because I did not think that hybrid was the best thing for my child. But it was my choice. And I'm glad I was given the opportunity to have that choice. And so I think we need to be as responsive and as mobile as we can be This is a moving target.

And the part that we're following for the that we're mirroring for the determination for accommodation is this piece right here. Criteria for teacher license administrative reductions. So we've got the Tier 1 criteria, which is really based on seniority. From there, we go to licensure. And then we also, there's a calculation for it, the endorsement areas that they're licensed in, whether or not a person's on a plan of improvement. That's all the Tier 1 criteria. In the Tier 2 criteria, that's where we are looking at special skills and training. educational certifications and honors and contributions to extracurricular programming, to curricular or extracurricular programs. And then obviously at this, at the elementary level, we don't look at the enrollment history and elective courses, but that is another piece of this. So that's the piece of the policy that we are following. We are looking at, we did do a Google form that allowed people to fill that piece in. And I'm going to see if I can share. the messaging that went out to the group, to each of the teachers that we sent this information to. Stop sharing this. So the teachers who needed to fill out a form for this consideration, received this letter from our human resources office. It's actually a letter from me, but it's sent out through human resources. And in this letter, we basically talk to, we tell them right there that the available number of positions is dependent on the number of students in stage three. We also tell them that they, that not everybody will, potentially not everybody will get the accommodation. And then there's the directions about going in the data collection form, And it talks about the priority that we were using the process similar to a reduction process. So this is the information that went out to those teachers. Obviously it came back in just yesterday and we're sorting through that now.<|eot_id|>\n",

And the reason for that is because we did not ask for specific information about those health conditions. It really is self-reported. And so there have been some teachers who have sent some information with doctor's notes and things like that. And we'll go back and take a look at that and see if any additional consideration should be given. But right now, we're really looking at just going straight through the process.\n",

And I don't know that all of you are aware that we did approve KTEC opening as hybrid. So many of its students of the programs require hands-on for students to get certifications. So that will be beginning in November. Perhaps as early as November 9th, when the second quarter begins, it may be delayed a little bit because they're putting in a new air filtration system, which is scheduled to go in that first week, but that could be shifted a wee bit.\n",

Ms. Drago and Ms. Gairdner both mentioned and we've gotten a number of emails about the verbiage in our policy and also how it's being used. So I just, I wanted to put it to the board to talk a bit, to clarify a bit about what our intention is with that policy in terms of keeping our kids and staff safest. For me, the new guidelines from the CDC designating 15 minutes of contact over a 24-hour period that came out yesterday or the day before, was it yesterday? It just makes me concerned about this idea of respite, as well as the comments, you know, talking about expectations of teachers to set it specifically. And, you know, if that could be used against teachers, or if it's something that they would need to be managing on top of everything else as a part of hybrid learning.

This is a synchronous session. We're working together, learning in person, not in person, but in the same time and space. Asynchronous is when students are doing independent projects, project-based learning, skill practice, those kinds of things that they can do offline.\n",

Some teachers will be providing video that they could do. beforehands for more of a flip classroom. So we've got a couple of options for teachers, but at the least we would do videotaping our zoom or our Schoology conference sessions.\n",

And we've had the bi-weekly COVID reports and the transportation issues and the space issues, but we've still managed to keep our eye on our development of a final strategic plan. of the strategic plan is focused on addressing in concrete ways the achievement gap and centerpiece of that plan is a reaffirmation of our anti-racism policy. And we did this in a very turbulent time. So I'm very pleased that we were able to do that. I mean, something that's really not on the sheet is I think our adaptability in terms of changing information, and I know it's been confusing to many people in the community, and notwithstanding some of the comments, we all do read a lot and study the issues. And we are here to use our best judgment, weighing the benefits for almost 14,000 students and our 2,500 staff. And a given parent might not weigh it in exactly the same way. We hear that frequently.

      "jonnoalcaro: Along the similar lines, I did this with Katrina and with Steve Colazar, Ellen's predecessor, with Kate, with Dave. This is going back two or three years ago. And I would like to do it again, and be happy to talk with anybody about it, is that we did a reach out to parents in each of the different magisterial districts. who were parents who we normally didn't hear from, who weren't comfortable, you know, doing something with, you know, talking to the school board, who weren't writing into us, who weren't calling us. And I would say that the one that we did in Kate's district and the one we did in Ellen's now district were the two best because we had great turnout. And we learned a lot from that. I still remember the stories in both of those. And in Whitehall, we had pulled pork. That's true. That's true. That was pretty good barbecue. Yeah, that was good. And it was great for us. But we only had three parents who came. You know, and so food wise, that was definitely the best. But that's something that I think we need the communication within our own divisions with parents. And so I think that could be a value. And then the other one that I'm going to talk with Jim Foley about is to go down and spend an hour or two hours sitting in the lunchroom at the bus barn. And the last time I did that was two years ago. And I talked to probably 75 drivers who were coming through that room. Maybe 60-ish, but it was well over 50. that, you know, it's just the thing of getting out and getting out and talking to the people who we want to trust us, you know, and to, you know, and it gets into the teachers, it gets into the staff, it gets into the parents and put ourselves out there. And I think it could be a good thing if we go in twos, a la Katrina's statement.\n",

It's mentioned in the statement of the areas of focus, but I don't really see a lot of discussion about, you know, the problems with recycling air that can carry the virus. And then also I had a question about hand washing in terms of how frequent it's being done. I watched the EAB webinar about best practices for returning to school, and they suggested doing hourly hand washing. And I don't see that in here, just entering and exiting rooms. And I don't know how often our particularly elementary school children who are in the same classroom all day will be entering and exiting. So I just wanted some clarification on that and a suggestion of a more stringent policy.<|eot_id|>\n",

You just want more specifics on it or just, can you just clarify the comment on the ventilation? Because I agree the importance of ventilation that we, will use both our systems to do that, as you know, our mechanical systems can flush in and out fresh air, but also through use of opening windows.

We don't have that on our radar. So that's exactly the kind of thing that we're looking for. We didn't know exactly how much time to allot for that. So it could be. that our discussion here is shorter than we imagined, but you've given the staff places where based on your knowledge and expertise, you'd like them to dive.

What are the key pieces that we might need to make sure that we're addressing and planning around? But that's, I mean, it's a great statement.

And to be frank, to speak in frank terms, I think, and when we get to the sort of mental health component, it's going to be important to realize that there will be waves of deaths. And those might be of, you know, our teachers our own students.

And although I do understand that some older teachers or at-risk teachers can do virtual, it's hard to be a virtual bus driver and what our policies on all that will be.

      "unknownspeaker: Many of those are questions that we can't just go and ask our staff. And one of the things that I also know is that just because a person is in a high-risk category, we can't force them to not work. So one of the things that we're going to have to do as we move forward is we're really going to have to work with our, our intention is for our supervisors to work with the staff, all staff, to determine are there underlying conditions that are going to prevent them from coming into work. if they are they going to feel comfortable coming in? Is that something that they are planning to do? We're developing a list of questions that will become guiding questions that our supervisors will work with their staffs on to determine what their actual needs are. This is something that once we have a better sense of what we talked about, learning more about our students and who's coming back that will also help us help guide us with what we're going to need staff wise to support those. And from there, what we will do is one of the things in the document, it talks about some accommodation and obviously you know virtual is an easy accommodation or relatively easy accommodation for. for teachers, but you're exactly right. That does not apply for other staff members. We've talked about, are there ways to reassign people to other situations that may allow them to do work that they may not have been able to do in their original job? And so those are some of the things that we're wrestling with. One of the things that I think is helpful to know is as we brought people back in for our first phase of our employees coming back into work, at this point, we've only had two people, I believe, that have needed to not come in yet. And so I'm hopeful that I know that right now there's a lot of unknowns and with the not knowing exactly start date and schedule and what school is going to look like, I know that there's a lot of angst for our employees around that. And I think that I'm hopeful that as we start to be able to give some more specifics, then we will be able to get some more specific information and work with everybody about whether or not they think they will be able to come back to work and in what capacity.<|eot_id|>\n",

And I learned that that is a privacy issue in a big, big way, and I fully understand that, and I'm not challenging that in the least. And it's at the same time, It's going to be very important for there to be some confidentiality side to it to protect the teachers, the staff, if they don't want it known that they're in that position. But I think it's going to be important for us to know, not the school board, you know, but within the system. And I'm not sure where I'm going with that, but it's just somehow it's important that somebody be aware. And I know that we'd be sensitive in order to, in dealing with it.

I think this is very much aligned to with what Ms. Collins was saying about the work that we're going to work with our families to educate our families and help them understand the importance of keeping your child home if there are symptoms. I think it's a very similar thing with our staff. We need to work with them, make sure that we've got really strong relationships, help educate as part of our coming back in training or onboarding, for lack of a better word, making sure that they understand the importance of being open and honest with their supervisors to let them know if something is going on. I think that's a first step. And obviously this is something that we need to get much better developed as far as that process goes. But I, you know, one of the things that I have heard throughout all of this is that when people are more upfront and when they know that things are going on, that we can better plan and prepare for the actualities. And that's what, you know, we would do.

And so this is the beginning of the communication around that. And just so you know, the press release from yesterday was also shared with all staff members through the compass, which is our mechanism for communicating with all of our staff members. Claire, if I may, it's great to have a handbook or a single source where people can look, but I would encourage from a public health communications perspective to also have posters and reminders everywhere in the schools and the bathrooms, on the buses, because people do forget, especially.

We've had that conversation around that and that one of the things sometimes we ask for donations and that might be something if we still find ourselves not able to purchase them, that we could ask the community to donate. So we're just trying to think about ways that we can get items that students need in their hands So thermometer starts looking like a backpack or a pencil or the things that we typically make sure that students have to start school. It seems to be an additional tool that we have to think about now. So that has been part of the conversation.

      "jay: Absolutely. So again, we were, you know, I'll go back to kind of what Roslyn was talking about a little bit earlier with this, but we, We talked about looking at the legality, whether we could force kids to wear them or not. Interpretations of CBC have been working with our school nurses and groups. And what our group talked about was encouraging kids to wear masks, having masks available at the school if kids wanted to wear one but didn't have one. And as well as, you know, in addition to wearing the mask, you also have the social distancing aspect or the physical distancing aspect within the classroom as well with that, Judy.\n",
      "unknownspeaker: So the bottom line on that is encouragement.\n",
      "deboracollins: When we talked to the health department, we were somewhat stronger when riding the bus because that you can't social distance there. We know that you can't be more than six feet apart. so that we're looking into being able to think about it in terms of the activity and not just, you know, everybody has to wear a mask all day long for everything you do. So trying to be very thoughtful about when and where. 10 students in a classroom that can social distance, how much mask wearing do you need to think about? And of course, that also depends on the age of this child. So there's, you know, lots of different pieces of this that we're going to have to land on the mask wearing part. And then, of course, Ross will chime in with what we can actually compel and what we can't. Well, I'm going to say, I'm sorry, Ms.<|eot_id|>\n",

      "rossholden: Lee. What I was going to say is that with respect to staff, as a condition of employment, we can require wearing of masks, especially if the teacher is going to be within six or seven feet of the student. On a bus, because we have layered mitigation measures and because transportation is different than providing education, we may have more latitude about requiring mask wearing on the bus as a condition of being allowed to get on the bus. With respect to in school, the guidance of the state so far is to recommend wearing of masks. We do have communities who may be very interested in having their children wearing masks, especially older children, and there may be some who do not. This is another legal conundrum right now because the laws really haven't caught up to our situation. And it is, I will tell you, in many meetings with school board attorneys around the state, this is something that's being debated right now. As Ms. Collins pointed out, it's a recommendation to wear the mask. And there really hasn't been a determination, and maybe as Mr. Oberg pointed out earlier, maybe it's going to require a higher authority to say that this is going to be a requirement of participating in our public schools.<|eot_id|>\n",

For me, that hinges on whether kids will be wearing masks. Because I know that even with ventilation, even with social distancing, and I think requiring children to social distance is, I mean, that's going to be hard to enforce. So I think knowing where we are with that at that moment when we survey is going to be important to say, hey, we'll be encouraging, but that's all we can do.

We have a program tool called Illuminate that allows us to do that. Our Seesaw for an elementary school is really a portfolio. So we actually, that one piece of our assessment, balanced assessment portfolio is well built. So that's, I mean, we've been doing that probably over the last five years of how do you build a balance assessment? How is it not just a multiple choice and true false kind of assessment? So those tools allow us to do that. The other piece I would add to Ms. Kastner's comment is one of the things that's happening with the professional development is for each unit that the teachers are teaching, they are coming in with a pre-assessment. So that's a pre-assessment, not necessarily of what they're going to teach, but the foundational pieces that should be in place as students go into that new content. I think you'll see a comment on mastery learning. That's best practice. It's something we've been moving towards and trying to get to. But this is one of those opportunities to magnify that and talk really quite well about what are key points, what is the student mastering in this, and be very diligent in our learning continuums. The skills that are needed, but the concepts and the processes that are needed to are spelled out very clearly for students. Sometimes those are hidden to students, but we're working very clearly and consciously on making those visible.\n",

We had ESL teachers working with our students one-on-one even throughout COVID. And what we learned was those learning partnerships were key in helping the students feel successful with their learning. And the teachers also emphasized that their level of creativity was robust during COVID-19 because they wanted students to be able to demonstrate their mastery in multiple ways.

I just got an email from my child's school about using it. What does it mean to Check and Connect? Is the teacher come this fall, is it going to look any different? Does the teacher actually visit the student or call them? Or if they're not engaging, how are they checking and connecting?\n",
      "michelecastner: I think they check and connect in multiple ways. I think it depends on the family. Most of the teachers would call the parents and talk to the parents about what would work best for your family in terms of connecting with the children. So I think it varies from family to family. I think the idea behind it is just to stay connected and to be super responsive to the child's needs and also the family's needs. I mean, we had many families that have six to eight children in the home. And so some families were saying, you know what, we're good because it was becoming almost too much.

Because for my child in an elementary, I can only really speak to elementary, but the online learning component is me.

And I, I understand this difference in our agenda today, but I do want to register my frustration that what was a two hour discussion was changed to two and a half minutes with just 10 minutes of notice. Um, and it really goes to a feeling that I have about our meetings in general, in which we are often surprised with detailed information, uh, that I personally would like more time to process, um, and give thoughtful feedback on, um, so, and I know that we will discuss our meetings in PD at some point, so I'll have comments then. Secondly, um, Where I am right now, I really urge us as a board to not look at our county as somehow immune to nationwide issues. I've gotten that feedback from a couple of folks and I recognize that we prioritize being an anti racist division and I applaud us for that. But we do still have the same stubborn outcome gaps as do other divisions. And as you saw also on the data that I sent last night, we still have the same types of issues with placing police where there are more lock and bound students. The daily progress has reported, um, that we have the same types of disproportionate minority contact and Elmore County as do other municipalities. So I really urge us not to disregard nationwide research as something that we think just doesn't apply to us.

Jono and I attended a educational law conference four years ago, about the same time there were some Department of Justice and other reports about disturbing reports about how SROs were implementing discipline and perhaps a disproportionate application of that discipline to some of our minority students. I did meet and Jono and I met but I met also with Matt and multiple members of our Staff to look at what our MOU looked like and I have to say it is It didn't look very good to me four years ago. It was not very specific about what we wanted to accomplish Having said that we've gone now to superintendents to police chiefs to lawyers. We have a very good SRO contract, but that does not, or draft MOU, that doesn't answer the foundational question of whether the SRO or what roles. I think it's very easy to get caught up in the visible presence of the police in the schools. And I'm concerned with that as well. encroaching in the areas of discipline, but there are layers of connectivity between the schools and the police department that are not, don't require that. And I would just have us look thoughtfully at how we address those various levels of function. Just to be clear, you still had 20 seconds. Oh, you were waving at me like, oh, wait a minute.

The one other comment that I did, I did want to make on the resolution that Judy did is I had a challenge with and happy to be shot down on this with the last paragraph, starting with resolve that the school board directs the superintendent. and goes in to examine the draft SRO MOU that's been under negotiation, whether it provides a model for further consideration, explore other security, et cetera, et cetera, is I would like to have that in there because if we are going to develop and maintain a relationship with the police department, we've talked about this, I know before, that there's going to need to be some memorandum of understanding so that the protocols for dealing with the different schools, the contact people, you know, the layouts and all of that. I somewhat resist abandoning the draft MOU, not because it should be, you know, implemented as is, but so that it could be a starting point Because there's a lot of good content in there. And there's some things that need to be changed. There are some things that probably need to be omitted. Well, need to be omitted. But I just don't think we should abandon that. And that's what I'm interpreting this draft to say.\n",

And so I don't want to screw anything up. But I think simple is better. And there was verbiage in here. I mean, I think this actually gives the superintendent greater latitude, but with direction. I don't want to tell the superintendent what he has to do, how he has to do it. I just want him to understand that my goal is this.<|eot_id|>\n",

I don't think taking it out excludes having an MOU. Correct me if I'm wrong, Jonah, but it sounds like what you're saying is we do need to have a memorandum of understanding. I don't think this is saying we're not going to have a memorandum of understanding, just that we need to make, and Judy, maybe you don't want one, but I like that it's crisp and it gives the direction that this is the end goal we want and that old MOU is not created with those goals in mind. And so they can still use it as a starting point as they move forward. But yeah, I don't read it as saying that we're not going to have an MOU or that they can't use it as a starting point.\n",
      "jonnoalcaro: I'm happy to stand corrected on that. I just want to make sure that they're not precluded. from using that as a starting point because that's the main thing that I want to make sure of is that that can be used because there is, there's good verbiage on some topics in there that I think would be invaluable to us going forward.

Even at this late hour, however, I propose that Dr. Haas include in his funding request to the board a five-year overview of the capital needs of our schools. The statute that requires a superintendent to make a funding request is not specific that it's limited to operating costs, and in fact, many other school divisions include both in the funding request. And I think that we ought to be in that category, that a way to elevate our capital needs, both to the supervisors, but even more so to the community is to include the needs of our capital. You've all heard me speak with some alarm that we now have about 100 classrooms in trailers. We have a very aging infrastructure. The average age of our core school is over half a century old and they're not set up in many cases for our 21st century teaching. So I guess I propose this.

      " Thank you, Chair Page. Last month, we had the wonderful opportunity to hear from Baker Butler educators about the nationally recognized gains they have made in closing the achievement gap at their school. Tonight we're focusing on yet another opportunity gap in our schools and in schools across our nation, the percentage of students of color who enter STEM related fields. 45 years ago, an organization was established to address this issue, the National Society of Black Engineers. Its mission was ambitious and vital to the collective prosperity of every community in the United States. The society was organized to promote academic excellence, provide scholarships, train leaders, and expand access to professional careers. A few years ago, the society broadened its charter to include high school chapters, and one of the first chapters in Central Virginia was established at Albemarle High School. Membership is open to students from all of our middle school and high schools, regardless of race or ethnicity. Students from Greer, Burley, and soon Walton are members and students are members, and students from UVA serve as mentors. There currently are 25 students in our local chapter, and more than 100 students have had their lives changed by this extraordinary program. Many have gone on to earn engineering degrees at the university level. The driving, guiding, determined light for these young people continues to be Ms. Pearl Early, Albemarle High School student support specialist. A characteristic of this program is its strong emphasis on project-based learning. Students learn how to research, design, experiment with, and refine solutions that can improve our lives. A natural topic this year is COVID-19, and true to form, students have come up with an ingenious approach to protecting public health. I understand that the nature of this development process is that it can take up to two years, but our students have field-tested their invention within seven months. I'd like to ask Ms. Early to tell us a little more about the journey of her students over these past seven years, and to introduce us to today's superstars who will tell us about their new discovery. Ms. Early?\n",

      "unknownspeaker: Are you referring to the Student Equity Advisory Town Hall? Yes, right. No, it's OK. No worries. There were roughly over 70 people that showed up. And I have to tell you, it was a Saturday morning. So that was very impressive. And it was completely led and facilitated by the young people. They started off with just a general overall presentation explaining what is anti-racism, the different types of racism, and then spent more time specifically on structural racism. And then the students themselves were actually the moderators for the presentation. And then afterwards, it was an opportunity for Q&A where the students got to ask the government and health care professionals just more questions related to what are the trends, What are the next steps? What's the impact? What's going on specifically in Charlottesville? I hope that answers your question. Thank you. Other questions from the board? I would just like to ask, because I sat in on the seat meeting last spring, and I thought it was absolutely terrific. And I thought the three speakers from the community were outstanding. Have there been other, I mean, I know you're talking about their involvement moving forward. Have they been involved with the with the team and in the meantime, in the last four or five months. So the state took a break over the summer and we allowed them some time to readjust to schedules. And so they picked up their meetings this fall. Since then, they continue to meet regularly. And they're already just kind of at this point, they're working towards their plans for the spring. So that's really been their attention and where they've been focusing their attention this fall. has been on the plans for the spring. And so that includes for the public awareness campaign, but also one thing that came up over the summer was back in June, they had some ideas about how they can support their peers in making reporting acts of racism and how to use social media, or rather, our anonymous alert app. And so that is one thing that they will be working on with Dr. King is thinking about how to create some tutorials. So that's really where some of their work has been from June and where they are now. Terrific. Thank you very much. Are there other questions? Yeah, just to follow up on that about the anonymous alerts app. What would you say the status is now of usage of that? I would have to check in with with Dr. King just to see what has been reported this fall. But one thing that we learned from the young people was just that, you know, not everyone knows how to use the app. The one thing I would just caution us is that, you know, the app even then when you report it, there are different layers, right, in terms of like the detail, the level of detail. And so we wouldn't necessarily want to solely rely on this app to report acts of racism and to follow up. But one thing that the students did talk about was it's one thing when they're learning about this from their peers. And so how do they make the app more accessible for their counterparts?<|eot_id|>\n",

      "jeffvergales: We've, absolutely. We've learned a lot about the immune system in relation to the COVID vaccine, significantly just in the last four to six weeks or so. You've seen some trials come out also with the Johnson & Johnson and Novavax vaccine, which the Johnson & Johnson is a single dose vaccine. There's a very specific reason that the Pfizer and the Moderna were put out as two-dose vaccines, and that was because initial studies suggested that they were probably about 75% to 80% effective after the first shot. And I remind you that we set the bar initially through the FDA at 50%. If we get 50% effective excuse me, 50% efficacy of a vaccine within any season, we're otherwise pleased, especially for a virus like this that spreads exponentially, that can have significant effects on its ability to protect somebody. The reason, though, that you did not see it stop at one shot and it go as a two-dose vaccine was purely because they found that the efficacy raised up to around 90% to 95% and 100% for preventing severe disease once you got that second dose. But that is why the FDA ended up approving it. And so while we obviously can't tell somebody, oh, you're fine, don't ever get the second, you're almost a whole way there. People should take solace in the fact that if they have one dose of the vaccine, that they've already begun the significant issue of developing immunity to it. And so I would encourage, and I've encouraged a lot of people, again, a lot of the teachers that asked me that very exact question last Friday when I was doing vaccines there, as I said, this is a big step. The second one is the one that seems to secure the memory response a little bit better. One just quick follow-up question is, with the first shot, is there still or is there a two-week period before that really takes effect as it is with the second shot? We think that you've probably managed to generate an immune response so that you actually have circulating antibodies sometime around that seven to 10-day mark after the first shot. And so that seems to be kind of the line in the sand that a lot of us that a lot of us are utilizing. With that being said, I know you guys have all seen also that the recommendation is still going to be that the vaccine is just one layer of mitigation and that even after people are fully vaccinated. We don't know we know that it is a good way to prevent people from beginning severe illness. we have no idea about its ability to prevent people from spreading the disease. And that's why you're not going to be seeing vaccination programs as part of mitigation strategies for large organizations because you're, you know, supplant things like mask wearing and physical distancing and all of the other information. And so I would say the vaccine as a general rule is that we excuse me, I apologize, the vaccine is a general rule for us, is a very personal decision of allowing, making sure that we can promise somebody is, or not promise, but get close to that, that somebody is not going to individually become sick. But I would encourage you not to think of the vaccine as a way to prevent spread within a school. We have absolutely no idea its ability to prevent that. And that's why all the data that I presented earlier is without vaccination, and I think needs to be kind of continued to be kept in that context. For an individual teacher, that's a different story. If we're concerned about individual at-risk people, the vaccine can make a noticeable, noticeable difference. But we do not know its ability to help prevent spread through schools. And that's why you will not see it as part of mitigation strategies. Thank you.<|eot_id|>\n",

      " I have a couple questions about virtual learning. First, I want to say I do appreciate all of the work and planning that's gone into this. I know that we're not dealing with unlimited resources and we have to make a lot of really difficult decisions to educate 14,000 students. So I really appreciate all the work that staff has done and definitely the people on the ground who are doing every day. So I really appreciate that. I just have a concern about the equity between the virtual learning and the hybrid learning. Also because we know nationally and locally that more of our black and brown families are choosing that. So I just want to make sure that we have some assurances. It will be important to me that we have some assurances that that is robust for my decision making. Firstly, I have a question about intervention services. And I think a way for me to be able to get my head around this is to know how many students will lose intervention services in stage four as it is now. And I know that you don't have those numbers ready, but that's something that I would like to know next week. Also, I would like to know how instructional hours for the hybrid learners will compare with the instructional hours of the virtual learners in K-3, or pre-K-3, I guess, for the four-day-a-week students. I assume that the 4-5, 4-12, I guess, would be the same. But I just would like to know the difference, if there is any difference between the instructional time for those youngest learners. And then I also would like to know how if or how meal services will be affected. For the students who are at home. And then on a different note, I don't know if this is something that Ross considers or we consider how this works. But I wonder if we should be looking at updated mask guidance, given that the new variant is likely coming or here. I know that we've all read a lot in the news about how the single cloth masks are just not as effective now against that. So that's just something I guess I'll throw out there.\n",

      "davidoberg: It strikes me, Dr. Collins, that we ought to be prepared for that to be sort of, there's a possibility, the extent that we reopen, there's going to be, that could be a growing issue. Saying as people get more comfortable, hey, look, it's been three weeks and I don't have any issues. Maybe I want to go back to school. I think that that may just be, that may be, I just hope we're prepared for that.\n",
      "unknownspeaker: And that change could go either way, right? What about if the person is in and decides to go to virtual? How long is the wait time for that?\n",
      "debbiecollins: That tends to be able to happen faster because the logistics aren't involved of coming to school and getting a seat, if you will, in a classroom. Now, having said that, we do know that there may be some virtual classrooms that may be on the high side, especially in some of the elementary schools. The middle and high school, we don't see that as a problem around going from hybrid to virtual.\n",
      "ellenosborne: Early on, we told teachers that they would not be required to be teach both virtually and in person, is that still the case?\n",
      "debbiecollins: Actually, I don't know that we told teachers that we told them we would work to try to offset that. And the principals have been working to offset that. And as we anticipated, some courses are easier to have that happen than others. English courses, some math courses are easier to accommodate that because if you think about a schedule of a ninth grader, in an English class first block, I might have three English nine teachers during that block so that I can move students around to accommodate hybrid or virtual. But if BC calculus is only offered one time during the day, then the likelihood of that teacher of us being able to offer a virtual divorced from a hybrid is less likely. Now, having said that, we are talking about looking across the division to perhaps accommodate that. The principals have been working very closely with the teachers to try to work through this and figure this piece out. The other thing I would say is, surprisingly to me, quite honestly, as teachers have talked about it, many of them have said, I would prefer to do hybrid and virtual together. This is something that the departments have been talking through, and the principals are very much aware of the workload.\n",
      "grahampaige: Okay, Ms. Collins, I think someone mentioned it, but all of the people who had their request denied, the principals have had a conference already with those people to explain why it was denied, right?\n",
      "debbiecollins: Yes, but I think Dr. Kaiser might be in a better position to answer that from a human resources perspective.\n",
      "clarekeiser: And the answer to that is yes. They and one of the things that I know that they many of them talked about is just, you know, helping them understand the mitigation strategies for some of the teachers. They haven't been in the school since since March. And so, you know, encouraging them to come in, see the mitigation strategies in action, kind of kind of make that first step into the school, I think, is a really important piece. And and one of the things that I know about our principals is they have very, very good and strong relationships with their staff. And we know that they can talk to them and help calm and ease their nerves. I think the fact that we have not seen a number of people say, no, I just can't do this. I think that's an indication that while they are uncomfortable, and I don't want to in any way minimize that. We know that we have a number of people that are uncomfortable coming back into school. I do feel like they, will be okay once they get in there.<|eot_id|>\n",

      "deboracollin: They are possible. especially with students being able to come in the building some of the time. One of the things we learned from our fine arts teachers and our visual and fine arts teachers is they were able to figure out how to do some of the work virtually. So I think that's part of the challenge of what will be for teachers is what do I need to have students in the building for? or hands-on for, or what resources do I need to hand them as they're going home that makes the work in our course, the standards that we set for the course, accessible and attainable for students. So I think that's part of the conversation, the ongoing teacher development that will take place. But you're right, some of it might be easier than others.\n",
      "davidoberg: My daughter took drama, and I got to tell you, some of the stuff they did virtually was really cool. I was really impressed by some of the good stuff they got to do.\n",
      "unknownspeaker: That's good to hear. Our teachers are amazingly creative.\n",
      "matthewhaa: I've heard some great stories from students and families about the creativity of the teachers and how they figured out. Some of the students have had some of the best experiences they've ever had during this time. And many students really adjusted well to a different format for school. It was almost like a break that they needed. So one of the challenges that we talk about at our level is as we make these kinds of plans, we have to leave enough room for the creativity of our teachers, our families, and our students to be part of the idea generating process and the iteration of what a class is gonna look like because that's where engagement comes from. planning this out with enough detail to make sure everyone is safe and that everyone will be treated fairly and have the best access that they can is our job. And then allowing that level of creativity to come in from the school level principals, the teachers, and the families and students, that's where you get the engagement.\n",
      "unknownspeaker: Just one more question for me. How have we been doing with our English language learners? And do we have anything additional planned for the fall?\n",
      "deboracollin: One of the things this kind of work allows us to do, if we have secondary students and not all the students are in the building at the same time, there could be groups of students that could come in every day. So English language learners could come in every day based on the kinds of scheduling we're looking at. They have been identified as high-risk learners. And all the task force documents from DOE, our task force, they're identified as a priority. So we would try to get them into school buildings as much as possible for as many days during the week as we could. So those become priorities for us. And as we start thinking about how we schedule, we look to those kind of principles, if you will, to help us decide.<|eot_id|>\n",

So I just am curious because I looked through the leave policy and, you know, I was just trying to figure out if teachers would have enough time and then if they would have coverage if they got sick.

      "davidoberg: from the state in order to start. This is not, starting before Labor Day is not the norm by any means. We have legal labor to do so.\n",
      "unknownspeaker: Yeah, that's good to point that out, Dave, because Albemarle County is an anomaly as far as our start date. Most of the school systems, particularly, the reason I look at it this way, too, is all around Richmond, the school systems start after Labor Day. And so the capitals in Richmond, the governors in Richmond, the VDOEs in Richmond, also on the south side, Peninsula, they all start after Labor Day. So we're all, we're just kind of looking at it that way that how do we get in alignment with moving toward phase three? Now, I do think it's important to ask our community and that's why we did the survey. And I really appreciate the board's patience with us having an established calendar and then coming back and saying, hey, would y'all entertain asking the public? And I'm really grateful to all the families for chiming in and letting us know what you think. I will say that I did discuss, I have been in discussion with a post-Labor-Day start with city school staff from the very beginning of our conversations about this. And I asked if city school staff would be interested in looking at this type of calendar. I understood at that time that there was some interest. They have not asked their community yet through a survey as to whether they would begin after Labor Day or not. I think they might, I think they may, but I obviously have no way of influencing that other than through collaboration. We do have, I am working on scheduling a meeting with our counterparts in the city for next Wednesday to discuss not only the post Labor Day start, but also what we are looking at as we begin to firm up our school site plans around offering instruction to students. I know they had already published some things to their community and I think they're also interested in learning more about what we're gonna be doing. I think it's important to just say those things because I want the board to know that we are trying to coordinate with the city and with what they're doing. If we end up on different schedules, we're gonna work with our staff. We're gonna work with our teachers, with our support staff to make sure that we meet their needs and help them as they make their way back to work.<|eot_id|>\n",

Many went to the additional classrooms we added with the mobile units at the high schools and Henley, but others went into existing classrooms to promote social distancing. We intentionally selected a style of desk that supports the goals of all these modernization efforts. So they reconfigure into different groups. And so our plan is once we start bringing all the furniture back that's from storage, right, and we will integrate those desks into some of these plans or upper grades. We have very intentionally purchased adjustable heights so they can be used in both elementary and secondary. It's because these classroom packages include desks, right, but they also include storage and seating, and so we feel like it would be all complementary of it.\n",

So it does work to a replacement cycle, whether it would start immediately once we finished the senior class or, you know, that's to be determined. But the other opportunity, and I'll be optimistic, is you'll get into a renovation cycle, a more robust renovation program, and then ideally you would merge furniture replacement in with your larger renovation projects, so. I think there's opportunity in the future to rethink this, but this, I think, is a good approach to start it.\n",

So I do, and this might not actually be for one principle to answer, but more for the division central office staff about how we can show that this type of funding does make a difference. Because I haven't seen any of the goals that we've had move. We haven't been able to move toward our goals in the 20 some years that we've had this type of staffing. I'm just, I'm curious how we can hold ourselves accountable to those goals. I'm not sure if that question is directed towards New York central staff. I'm happy. More like central staff. Okay.

      "matthewhaa: Thank you, Steve. Thank you for the presentation, Steve. I really appreciate it. And thank you, Miss Lee. What I think is that we can demonstrate using the staffing at the schools. We may not see from year to year perhaps great gains in achievement, whereas achievement is measured one time per year with one test, with an SOL test. However, all of our schools demonstrate growth for their students, particularly students that are behind, even with the SOLs. Ever since Virginia introduced growth as a measure for SOL testing, many of our schools have maintained the very rigorous standards for accreditation by showing growth with their students. I know that when Dr. Saunders was principal at Baker Butler, the way he really began to develop the success of the school was first through growth. And then that led to eventually the Blue Ribbon Award for the school around closing achievement gaps. Much of that accomplished with differentiated staffing at the school. I believe the same thing will happen at Greer. And I believe that as we focus more on growth, which is really a measure of a student moving from where they are at the beginning of the year to the middle of the year to the end of the year, that's where we're going to see the gains that we have. Ultimately, a student coming into school who is behind, who's had interrupted education, or perhaps comes from another nation where they have not been to school at all, they have to make more rapid growth than a typical student. And so I think it's incumbent upon the division, as you said, to develop a way to see that growth and make it more transparent to our community. I fully support what you said, what you suggested. The growth is there. Our students are more successful. They learn a great deal during the year. And we owe it to our teachers and our community to celebrate those successes. Right now, we are holding ourselves accountable to a static one-time-per-year measure. We really need to focus on growth.<|eot_id|>\n",

      "matthewhaa: So annually, schools develop a strategic improvement plan for their school. Over time, we have become more and more centralized and consistent across the school division around what the goals are for the school based on their growth and achievement from the year before. That's highly structured. All of those are available transparently on our school division's webpage, and they can be accessed from each individual school.\n",
      "katrinacallsen: And Matt, I think I brought this same question up the last time we went through the budget cycle, only I worded it slightly different, which was just, do you provide oversight and are counseling with the principals to help them when they're making these decisions? And I believe you had answered yes at that point. So at that, I will yield and just say, I agree with Judy in the fact that, you know, is maybe it's time to, tie it to metrics or look at there's other models or something else we've been doing a long time. So if I may finish.\n",
      "matthewhaa: What happens next is after they've made their school improvement plans and as they work their way through the year we have mid year review. Right after mid year review is where we begin to do the staffing process for the coming year schools are assigned staffing as well as differentiated staffing they develop. staffing plan that's in alignment with their school improvement goals for the coming year. They come to the central office with that plan. They meet with a team, including members of our equity staff, our deputy superintendent for instruction, personnel staff, and finance staff. to ensure that the staffing plan that they've developed will align with their school improvement goals to meet the growth goals as well as the achievement goals that they have for the school. It is a shame that after the, as we made our way through the 18-19 school year and really firmed up these procedures and became more consistent than ever, that we came into a pandemic. And many principals have, really been struck by the fact that they were making great progress during the 18-19 school year and 19-20 school year. We could see the growth. And so we have really been thrown off by the past two years of the pandemic. I am looking for next year to be a year of great growth for our students as they return. And I hope the board understands that We do not just sprinkle staffing around the school system, leave it up to the principals to do what they want with it, and then hope for the best of success. It is far more organized, it is far more resource-oriented, and it's targeted toward meeting students' needs. Thank you.\n",

And so I think that's a long-term goal, but given that aside from Mountain View, most of the schools are still in their initial years, we just don't have the ability to collect that long-term data, which really is what we look for in world language learning.<|eot_id|>\n",

      "unknownspeaker: Other questions or comments for Ms. McLean? I guess I'm sitting here thinking through it in my head, and I will just throw on support for Judy's comment and say, I guess I would like to see some more qualitative data or quantitative data around this as well. Because my worry is I'm thinking through it. It's like another special kind of. And I remember there being rationales behind it, If you are having a Spanish teacher in a school that's got a lot of Spanish speakers, it gives them a time in the week where they can be an expert in something and they can be feeling like they're. So there's things and I know that you guys considered them and I guess I just want to maybe maybe it's time at some point this year to have another presentation on on West because. yeah, I just want to make sure it's tied to why we're doing it and what it's tied to. And I have some questions like, you know, if you get once a week language instruction, well, I think it's really important. And I'm sure there's benefits outside of academic benefits. Are you really going to be fluent in the language? But you know, what, what really is going on?\n",

      "milesnelson: Hi, I'm Miles Nelson. I'm the coordinator of mental health and wellness for Alamo County Public Schools. So I understand that there were some questions surrounding SEL counselors. Can you move to the next slide, please? That came up during Dr. Haas's budget proposal. So I'm here tonight to highlight how the SEL counselors help enhance the school counseling program through a combined focus on mental health and social emotional learning. Next slide please. This graphic shows the overlap of some of our school-based mental health professionals. First, I'd like to talk about our school counselors. They are state-licensed school counselors who focus on three core domains, academics, career, and social-emotional learning. Then we have, due to the school board support, we have added our SEL counselors who come from a variety of backgrounds. So they have licensed professional school counselors, social workers, et cetera. So these positions were implemented to be in conjunction with our school counselors to help each school support our students social emotional learning based on feedback from teachers, parents, community members, and administrators from the pandemic. So I hope this helps clarify the distinction between our SEL counselors and our school counselors.\n",

I have a slide here to guide that discussion. you to separate in your brain what the immediate points are that you would like staff to take away in order for you to be prepared to adopt a funding request a week from today. And then secondly, what are those long-term items that should be considered as we continue through the budget process or we look forward to next year's budget process? So we'll start with question number one, some guiding items under there are what other information would you like in preparation for the approval of the funding request? What immediate action items do you have for staff? And also what is one takeaway for the request to the Board of Supervisors on March 14th? So what is one thing that you would like to stress in that presentation that would be presented by the chair and the vice chair? So we'll start with question number one and those bullet items if you want to take a minute to think about it. And we'll just have a casual discussion so you can chime in when you would like.

So that year would fund the design costs and then the following year would have the budget for the construction costs.

      "unknownspeaker: Okay, great. Thank you. I did have a question about the phases for the increase to 15. So there's phase one. and then phase two. And I was just wondering, in phase one, the people who would get up to 15 in phase two, would they get an increase or are they just hanging out where they are? And also, what percentage of the 17.8% are in phases one and two?\n",
      "hatthewhaas: That's a great question. And I'm going to turn things over to Maya Kumazel.\n",
      "mayakumazawa: What we mean by phase one is that we're raising the minimum pay rate for full-time VRS-eligible employees. Having said that, all employees' salaries who are making on the lower end of the wage scale, everyone will be lifted, just not necessarily to the 15 if you're a part-time VRS-ineligible employee. So the next phase would include all employees, so we would be raising the part-time VRS ineligible scale to $15 and that would continue to push up the people who were already at 15. So that they wouldn't get compressed because we have two different pay scales for those groups and they have to have a differential between them due to VRS reasons. So the increase would continue through phase two for most employees in that pay grade four through 12 group.\n",
      "unknownspeaker: OK, so just I'm going to repeat back what I think what I heard. OK, so the full time VRS eligible would get the bump in phase one, but the part time VRS ineligible. Would get a bump, but not necessarily up to 15 until phase two, correct? And then do you have even a rough percentage would be helpful of who's in those two groups?\n",

      "unknownspeaker: Ms. Kastner, so with those proposals, we'd be able to have all of our students receiving services that would be comparable to what they had before the pandemic, right? Yes.\n",
      "grahampaige: Could you give us a breakdown on where the students are coming to us from, you know, roughly, or is that too much right now?\n",
      "unknownspeaker: I can get that information to you. I don't have it in front of me right now, but it's not particularly from one area. But I can get that to you. Okay. All right, thanks. Ms. Kastner, do you have a breakdown of where those FTE will be allotted or in which way, how they'll be distributed across schools? Or will it just be going back to where they were before? Well, I do want to point out that the top schools that receive the most newcomers are Albemarle High School, Jewett, Greer, Woodbrook, and Mountain View. So typically, We get newcomers and many of them actually go to Albemarle High School and do it. So what we'll do is based on where the students go, we have a formula that we follow that will follow the students. So the support would follow the students whichever school they land in. And do you feel like we're adequately serving, and it's a broad question, but adequately serving our ESOL students? Because I know last year, we were talking about the need for expanding. And so I guess I'm curious if we're restoring to our previous level, if there's still a need there, is this one of those areas where there's still a need?\n",
      "michlecastn: Well, I will say our staffing standards in Elmar County are actually far better than what the state standards are. The state requires one ESOL teacher to every 53 students. And on average in Elmar County, We have one teacher to every 35 students at the secondary level, and one teacher to every 26 students at the elementary level. So I feel that our staffing standards are excellent in Elmar County. We have a total of 48 ESL teachers in our division.\n",

      "ryanmckay: Thank you and thanks to the board for having me this evening. Again, my name is Ryan McKay, I'm the Director of Policy Planning and COVID Operations for the Health District. And just sort of to reiterate some of the numbers that Dr. McLaughlin had presented, we are seeing by far the largest surge that we've experienced in our community. I would say at this point it's uncontrolled surge. But our focus and our attention really is on more of the high risk or locations that may have potential for spread. So thinking about congregate settings, schools, for instance, is where a lot of our attention is focused so that we could do everything we can to keep schools open, to keep children in classrooms, to keep disease out from locations where it's going to be at risk for those who are most vulnerable. In terms of some recent changes from the CDC, and this really speaks to some of the quarantine and isolation components, the CDC had altered its recommendations for the general population. So isolation reduced from 10 days to five days. in quarantine reduced from 14, 10 or seven days down to five days. Now that's provided that the individual who was in isolation or in quarantine can mask the entire time that they're outside of their home between days six and 10. And what we recognize is that there is still the risk that someone is infectious or that someone can develop disease. between days six and 10 and potentially infect others. So our recommendation to schools throughout the health district and to daycare centers has been to maintain the 10 days of isolation and quarantine, given how quickly Omicron spreads and the volume of numbers we're seeing in the community. Again, to meet the sole goal of keeping our schools open so that students can continue in-person education.\n",

And I know a bunch of students who are really stressed because they just don't know where we're going. What is the threshold at which we throw up our hands and go, OK, we're going to close for two weeks? Is there a threshold? And if so, what is it? Well, what we are doing is monitoring school by school, right? And so it really does vary school by school. I'm not sure we can quite say if it's X percentage of teachers who are out or X percentage of students who are out because of the nuances at each school, right? Some schools have the ability to combine classes or get those classes covered. So I understand that, right? That folks wanna know, hey, if we hit this level, we want to know what's happening. And I just don't think we can get that specific with it, other than saying that we're monitoring each school and if we feel like the school can't function in an in-person environment, we've got plans in place to move over to a virtual for a period of time. I have a question. I don't know, perhaps it's for Ms. Gomez. I had a question last week about the quality of the mass, much of the literature I've been reading. I mean, there's a lot of variability. You can see it if you just walk down the street. But what is our policy in terms of providing NK-95 mass to our teachers and staff at least or to students? And what are we doing and what should we be doing?\n",
      "eileengomez: We are providing K and 95 masks to our all of our staff optional for them to use, and we do have a very good supply of that. Lindsay Saudi who is the director of building services has been looking at the options of trying to get other masks for students. Our medical advisors suggested that we look to purchase three-ply surgical masks for students, because those are probably the most comfortable, the ones that they'll most likely be able to wear for the entire day. So she's pricing those and looking into the availability of those for our students.\n",

What are all those people? I'm kind of just curious. I don't know how the periphery students work and how long we keep them out for.\n",

Even though our vaccination rates for the students is pretty high, what are we doing or are we doing anything as a system to sort of encourage those kids who have not been vaccinated to be vaccinated? And are there any problem groups in that unvaccinated category?\n",

It was scheduled for last week, but it was postponed due to the weather.

So I feel like those trends are, It's hard to prove a negative, but having the whatever you might call success that we've had with vaccinations, this is a community that's sought vaccination with just exceptions to it. The one thing we did do, I think, above and beyond was we did require all of our employees to be vaccinated or to go through weekly testing, which that's unusual in Virginia. And then also requiring our athletes to be vaccinated or do testing as well. Those were measures, the employee vaccinations and athletics were above and beyond what the norm is.\n",

I'd be more in favor of guidelines as opposed to a policy, because I've got concerns about voting in favor of a policy that we're going to be in violation of on day one. But if we had guidelines to work towards, that would be more of a positive to me. But the other part of this that's missing is we still don't, and Dr. Acuff and I worked with the CIP group, and I'm gonna be very interested to see what the county executive's budget request is gonna be. Because we weren't able to really get a strategy in place that would create revenues or direct monies to CIP for building of schools. And until we've really got a channel and a system in place, and I mean, there's so many different ways that could be done, but I just wouldn't be comfortable with doing a policy in this area. Guidelines maybe.\n",

      "matthewhaas: One thing that Dr. Kaiser, you know, this was a part of a slate of improvements that we did around substitutes. And the other part that the increased funding into our base operational budget for this year that the board approved tonight as part of the consent agenda that Ms. Schmidt pulled. That's helping to fund these changes in addition to hiring a permanent substitute at each school as a beginning. And then we're going to establish staffing standards so that larger schools would have more of what we would call permanent substitutes at the school to help cover when teachers need to be out. It's certainly needed during this time. However, I really feel that prior to the pandemic, we did have shortages of coverage for our teachers so that they can take off when they need to take off so that they can be well. So that's just one of the pieces that the board approved tonight. If you go back and look at the line items for that approval, you put in place a lot of things for our employees around compensation and other benefits that are going to help them through the spring.

And as Dr. Kaiser mentioned, these clinics are being done in partnership with the Charlottesville City Schools along with the Regional Emergency Operations Center. I was on site all day and just the true collaboration and teamwork pulled this off. So we received logistics support from our public safety and emergency management colleagues. We had staff volunteers from administrators to various departments and schools, all levels of organizations serving as our registrars, our screeners, our assistants, traffic control that made this event possible. Most importantly, our school nurses in conjunction with nurses from the city went through training and became our vaccinators. Again, it was just truly a site of collaboration and teamwork that went smoothly today, and we look forward to the next two days. So this initial clinic was at Charlottesville High School. Our plan is to do a site at Monticello High School as soon as next week, assuming doses are available. And for now, we will operate one site at a time, switching between the two, but it is our goal that we would ultimately have both up and running. to get through the remainder of our employees and then second doses as well. So I know employees are anxious to know when the next one will be. We will not know from week to week what doses are available to us, but we are standing ready to stand it up as soon as we have doses to put in arms. Thank you.\n",

What we do not know is how that's impacting us right now. The health district will generally tell us when they feel that's happening, and our numbers are a bit lower or higher on either end.

So as you can see, teaching assistants and food service associates are the highest frequency group, along with custodians, special education staff, and transportation staff. In total, we have about 450 current employees with wages lower than $15 an hour. The reason why the price tag on this proposal is so high is because of the effects of compression, which we have to plan for.

You all know this and have expressed your opinion on this already, but it's important to keep all this in mind as we talk about compensation. The next budget priority area is strategic operational restoration. I've listed here the areas that were cut in our current adopted budget. So we implemented 5% cuts to school and department operating budgets. If we were to restore those, it would cost about $700,000. We also reduced 15 FTEs, operational support, instructional across the division. that equates to approximately $1.2 million. We also paused a transfer to the Learning Resources Fund, formerly called the Textbook Replacement Fund, of half a million dollars.

We are utilizing our subs pretty much similarly as we would in a regular school year. Now, fortunately, we have not had, you know, knock on lots of different things. While we've had, you know, people who are have been out sick, we have not had a, or for different reasons, we have not had a a mass need for subs as we kind of anticipated that we might. We also still realize that we still have half the year to go. And at whatever point we go to stage four, we do bring in more staff at that time too. So that could shift. Long-term subs are paid. It's about 217 something and a cut and some change or something like that. each day for the time that they are working with us. And again, we are having a typical number of long-term subs as we usually do.\n",

      "unknownspeaker: I'm glad you mentioned that about our retired teachers. We do have a bonus for our retired, kind of a, I shouldn't say it's a bonus. We have a higher pay rate for our retired teachers who have come back to work with us. And that number is escaping me right now, but I can get that for you. For a daily sub, the minimum qualification is a high school diploma. For a long term sub, The preference is that they are a certified teacher in the area for which they are substituting long-term. We are able to do that in most instances. If for some reason there is a situation where we don't have anybody in a pool who's qualified in that subject area, then we will go to somebody who is a licensed teacher, maybe not in that area, but you do have to have a bachelor's degree at a minimum to be a long-term substitute. Claire, remind me what a long-term is?\n",
      "clarakeiser: A long-term sub is for any substitute who is subbing for 10 or more consecutive days. And we have people, and they can't exceed 90 days. If they exceed 90 days, we need to hire them because that's kind of the guidelines around the long-term subs.\n",

Thank you. Thank you, Maya. Thanks. And are we having any problems getting subs, especially during this time? As I have shared at different times throughout this year, getting subs in a non-pandemic year is a challenge. So we are seeing similar challenges to what we have seen in prior years.

The second group would discuss whether the budget goal of providing a salary and benefit plan that supports our competitive position. And the third group would talk about our operational services. And the guiding question for the first piece is, does the budget, as you've heard, support the goal you're assigned to? If yes, how does it do so? And if no, why does it not? And these will be fairly quick. We'll put you in the rooms and you'll discuss this one question for 10 minutes. We'll bring you back in. We'll report to the larger audience what you all have discussed. And then I'll put you back in those rooms for the second question. So the first one is to discuss guiding question number one. On the next slide here, in case you have it open, we have the budget goals listed here in case you need to refer back to it. And as you discuss, note anything, if there's anything that you expected to see that isn't in there within your groups. We'll have staff and cabinet members in each of your groups to help you out. So are there any questions about this? Okay, Ms. Johnson, I think we're ready to be spread out. And there's no jam boards this time. This is just a free discussion.\n",

      "davidoberg: OK, let me let me let me hypothesize. We're not going to do this, and I accept that we're not going to do this. But how do you think the board supervisors would respond if we said we're going to restore the raises that we gave them last year? and we're going to give a raise this year. Because from a practical standpoint, if you're talking about actually, you know, increasing the salaries, this is 13 years that we've been playing catch up. I mean, literally 2008, there was supposed to be a really good raise, a legitimate raise. And then the market collapsed. And nothing took place. And we've been giving 1% and 1.5% raises. And then we gave what was theoretically a 5% raise, paid for by the governor, but which all went back to paying retirement benefits. So on paper, yeah, our staff got a really good raise, but they didn't see another penny in their pocket. And so we have employees who are making barely more than they made 13 years ago. And I know it's not unique to education. There are a lot of stagnant salaries out there. But the fact that the board of supervisors was like, oh, yeah, we think that there should be a raise. And I think it's great that they're willing to acknowledge that. But I think as a board, we need to acknowledge that we are not compensating our employees at a fair level, and that giving the 2% or 3% raise is kind of pointless. I mean, 2% of nothing is nothing.\n",
      "katrinacall: Those are some bold words. We're giving them raises. But ultimately, it's our decision. It is our decision. We don't have to ask the Board of Supervisors. We just need to make our own budget work to whatever we think the priorities are. If that's what we want to prioritize, that's what we have to do.\n",

      "katrinacall: I would, actually. I'd want them to do whatever they wanted to do. My son wants to be a smoothie maker right now, though. steps away from getting to the educator level. And I'm encouraging, he makes great smoothies. He makes one for me every day.\n",
      "davidoberg: All I can say is that when I, my, my, the starting salary of a New York attorney when I graduated from law school was $40,000 more than my father got paid after 30 years of teaching. My father, who was a passionate public educator, was very, very concerned if I thought about going into public education because he didn't want me to have to deal with the financial troubles he's had to deal with. And he loved education. He still loves it, but it's an issue.\n",

And I just like that we're staying focused because I think something, I don't wanna make assumptions, but I think sometimes it's like new and then you forget about in the new and then.\n",

So it made it look like our infection rate was higher than the surrounding counties, which was not true. But because of the way the CDC did it, they're assuming every county has a hospital, right? But it's impossible for a county that doesn't have a hospital, and there are a number of them in Virginia. to be impacted by that number. So it's only by the number of actual infections.

And they take the total number of cases that happen within that health district, hospitalizations that happen within that health district, and farm it out based on proportion of size of the county.

I don't know if it's a perfect system for that, but you can see counties without a hospital in them have an elevated level of hospitalizations as an intuitive as that seems.\n",

Okay.\n",

We didn't eliminate or we didn't create an operational ability from, my understanding, and tell me if I'm wrong, Dr. McLaughlin, is that staff wants to be able to reinitiate the practices on a case-by-case basis based upon outbreaks so that we don't, because from a practical standpoint, we will not have the speed to respond to another outbreak. So if there's a sudden huge increase in cases, we don't want to be caught flat-footed. And so we want to have an operational system such that superintendent and his staff in coordination with the health district can reinstitute some of these things based upon their need on an immediate basis, as opposed to waiting for us to adopt a policy. Am I correct, Dr. McLaughlin?\n",
      "patrickmclau: That is correct. So number one, we've checked that one off the list. The board made a motion, approved a motion to end policy EBA, which ends the requirement for masks and for staff and visitors effective April 4th. There are two other things we'd like the board to consider tonight. The first is to provide direction to staff to amend policy GBE so that we have the flexibility to operationalize masking decisions based on the current situation in the community. And we don't have to have a motion for that. That's right. You can just give us direction on that.\n",

And we are recommending that we, or weekly testing. And we are recommending that that take place effective April the 4th. I believe that would need a board motion.

These sets of assessments that they looked at are designed to help identify those problems and, for the remainder of the year, put some practices in place that are going to lead to improved results. So I would say, when we get our end-of-year data that's in, I think something that would be very interesting to see is, where did we end up with in terms of accreditation compared to where we were with our midyear assessments, especially since this year was really the first year we've had these wide ranging assessments for everyone.\n",

I'd love to see side-by-side comparisons of the two different reports, at least, you know, I'm looking at the one that we did with the sixth and 12th graders, you know, to see, If the numbers that are in purple at the top of the Column, you know what, what do they compare. And, you know, from first coming back, I mean, Mr. Bonham made a great point about, you know, some of the numbers being relevant to just coming back into school after being basically out for 15 months.

      "christinediggs: Hi, I can answer that. I'm Christine Diggs, Chief Technology Officer. We fortunately just received notice today, as a matter of fact, from the delivery company that they will arrive at our office by 4 p.m. on Monday. As you know, our order that we placed in July was out of stock in the United States and is coming from China. And we were unable to track it. Apple could not give us any kind of tracking information. So we've been operating completely in the dark, but did get word today. So we have already plans in place to have staff working every night next week until 10 p.m. to try to process those as quickly as we can. There's 1,660 of them, and it's a slow process to get them into our inventory, into the cases, and assigned to students in buildings. But we're gonna work around the clock to get them out from our offices as soon as we possibly can.\n",
      "unknownspeaker: And so do you anticipate that would happen by the end of next week with all of that work? I appreciate the work. Do you have a sense of that timeline? So, you know, ordinarily I might be able to give you a better estimate, but I don't feel like I can promise.\n",
      "christinediggs: We feel like we can finish by next week, the end of next week. The challenge we have right now is that we have very limited staff that's based centrally that we know we can pull during the day to do the work. We can't really pull our building-based staff right now from supporting their schools and parents and students. They're on site in our buildings, but they're also fielding phone calls that come in to help kind of offload from our service desk. So without having really the full availability of our staff to also help process these, we can only do it after hours. Right now, I can't predict how many folks are available after hours to come in after a long day of supporting families and students. It's a little unpredictable right now, but our goal is to have them processed by next Friday. And if we can deliver before that, we absolutely will. And I know building services is ready and they're on call on standby that if we get some ready, they'll be able to help deliver for us, which will be a help that we won't have to also be delivering.\n",
      "katherineacuff: Great. So Christine, it is the case, however, that all of our students have some sort of device, even if it's not optimal.\n",

      "christinediggs: Hi, I can answer that. I'm Christine Diggs, Chief Technology Officer. We fortunately just received notice today, as a matter of fact, from the delivery company that they will arrive at our office by 4 p.m. on Monday. As you know, our order that we placed in July was out of stock in the United States and is coming from China. And we were unable to track it. Apple could not give us any kind of tracking information. So we've been operating completely in the dark, but did get word today. So we have already plans in place to have staff working every night next week until 10 p.m. to try to process those as quickly as we can. There's 1,660 of them, and it's a slow process to get them into our inventory, into the cases, and assigned to students in buildings. But we're gonna work around the clock to get them out from our offices as soon as we possibly can.\n",
      "unknownspeaker: And so do you anticipate that would happen by the end of next week with all of that work? I appreciate the work. Do you have a sense of that timeline? So, you know, ordinarily I might be able to give you a better estimate, but I don't feel like I can promise.\n",
      "christinediggs: We feel like we can finish by next week, the end of next week. The challenge we have right now is that we have very limited staff that's based centrally that we know we can pull during the day to do the work. We can't really pull our building-based staff right now from supporting their schools and parents and students. They're on site in our buildings, but they're also fielding phone calls that come in to help kind of offload from our service desk. So without having really the full availability of our staff to also help process these, we can only do it after hours. Right now, I can't predict how many folks are available after hours to come in after a long day of supporting families and students. It's a little unpredictable right now, but our goal is to have them processed by next Friday. And if we can deliver before that, we absolutely will. And I know building services is ready and they're on call on standby that if we get some ready, they'll be able to help deliver for us, which will be a help that we won't have to also be delivering.\n",

What's happening right now is the process of families are realizing and trying them, oh, this one doesn't work. So now they're going to have to work through the, there's five different options, right? There's five different carriers. So they're trying to work through that process of, oh, if this AT&T one isn't working, then they'll give them the next best guest that they can have. And it's an educated guest, but it's still a guest in terms of cell signal from their home location. And for an example, we had a family out in the Crozet area that went through all five different carriers.

I'm not remembering what the employer contribution increase was last year.\n",

Our management plan says that we have to keep the balance or have a plan to draw down the balance. to be between 16 and 33%. And at the beginning of last plan year, we had a 62% reserve. And because of COVID and because of the things we didn't know about, obviously we were gonna be very conservative with those numbers. And so with the plan holiday, that drew down the reserve considerably, but we're still in a good position. The projections show that we'll draw down the balance to our target around 33% in the next two fiscal years. We want to do that in a slow and steady pace, just in case there's any other unexpected expenses that may come up, because obviously it costs more to do everything these days, and that includes going to the doctor.

That's awesome. It's been really exciting this morning. I've been out to visit six schools so far. They were all in the southern part of the county. And it was just wonderful to see the students. The students really are happy to be back. A lot of activity, a lot of excitement. And so that's really been the best part of the day. My observation is that when you go around, this is just like any other first day of school. It's just some of the mitigation strategies require distances and we're all wearing masks, but this really feels the same. Having said that, I know there's been an enormous amount of work behind the scenes at the school level and really around the county to make sure that students are gonna be safe and feel safe, and that families feel good about having their children back at school. We're inundated with families and their excitement to be back in the building. Normally our open house has about 300 families that come. We're well doubled that. Six to 700 students and families entered our building. And today we are just overfilled with joy as we have 1,200 students back in our building for the first time in 17 months. This first day has been awesome. It's been a long time since I've had so many kids in my classroom so I'm just super excited to see them. The kids are respecting all of the new rules and I can tell that they're really really excited and a little nervous to be here. So I ran the freshman orientation that we had two weeks ago and the biggest takeaway for me that just made me so happy is that I asked the kids so What did you think about freshman orientation? You said, well, I'm not nervous anymore. And I said, well, that was my number one key, like the number one thing that I wanted to get out of orientation for these kids. As we tackle these first couple of days, we're just making sure the students get to the right rooms, they feel comfortable, they feel safe, they feel like this is the right environment for them. As far as mental health, we are offering one-on-one counseling. We've had families come in, we've met with parents to talk about the mitigation standards that we are putting into place to make sure everybody is prepared and that there's no surprises. All of our teachers, our principals, all the cafeteria employees, bus drivers, they have really shown through for us.

      "unknownspeaker: OK, thank you. Chair Page, I have just a question. I don't know if it's for Matt or for Rosalyn. Rosalyn, every other school division seems to be having bus driver issues. And I know we have historically, what does our census look like? And do we all need to study for a CDL? Like Superintendent Haas has done?\n",
      "rosalynschmitt: I'll answer your last question. Yes, we are always recruiting drivers. So if anyone's interested, let me know. We do, we are dealing with a shortage. And the good news is, I think we are in better shape than our surrounding districts and what you're hearing in the news, particularly in the city. We are down drivers. Thanks to our very dedicated transportation staff, though, they are pulling it off. We have had some longer runs and some creative routing, so we are dealing with shortage. It's not as bad as the other districts, but we are continuing to challenge in that area.\n",
      "unknownspeaker: Okay, thank you, Ms.\n",
      "grahampaige: Smith. The other item that we have is that we need a delegate and an alternate for the Virginia School Board Associations meeting in Williamsburg, November the 17th through the 19th. So do we have volunteers and or draftees for one for our delegate and one for the alternate to attend the sessions, the delegate sessions at the state convention?\n",

And we send two people, well, we send someone who comes and gets to vote either yes or no. So you get to read through them, present it to us, whether or not there's anything we need to be concerned about. And then you get to go to a special meeting at the conference where you get to, I keep doing this because you get to have a cool little like voting thing to say yes or no. It's neat.

      "patrickmclau: So moving on the final two steps of final two pieces that we need to do is understand the community and and school needs and determine our best mitigation strategies that we have and as you recall, we looked at the nine key prevention strategies that were provided by The CDC and the Virginia Department of Health, and we feel like our current mitigation plan is an effective one in preventing the spread within our schools again we were expecting some sporadic cases, but we have not seen any cases of transmission within our schools. to date since we opened up. And finally tonight, I'd like to provide you with some updated information about our staff vaccination program for the board's resolution, beginning September 15 always CPS employees are going to be required to be vaccinated or show proof of a weekly negative coven test. Employees will attest to their vaccination status through a survey and will be asked to show proof of vaccination if contact tracing is needed. That survey is set to launch no later than Monday, August 30. We may have it out as soon as tomorrow. And once it does launch for our employees, they're going to have one week to complete it and send that information into us. As you know, we want to keep everything confidential, so vaccination status will not be shared unless that knowledge is necessary for contact tracing. And as vaccine status changes, employees will update us with that information. In terms of the testing of employees who choose not to get vaccinated, we are currently in the procurement process for a COVID testing provider and hope to have more information on that in the very near future. And so I thank you for your time tonight. And Eileen and I and other staff members would be happy to take any questions or comments you might have about where things stand with our COVID update.\n",
      "grahampaige: Do we have any questions from the board on the update?\n",
      "unknownspeaker: I have a question about the quarantines. So we have, did you say it was 20, Patrick, that are quarantined right now? 21 students and one staff member currently in quarantine. And this was something that I had asked Rosalind about a little earlier. So where are those quarantines coming from? Like what areas of the school day are they coming from?\n",
      "eileengomez: The majority of them seem to be coming from transportation, from buses.\n",
      "rosalynschmitt: And if I could elaborate on why that is. So if you recall, the definition of a close contact last year was if you were within six feet of an individual for 15 minutes or longer over the course of 24 hours. In the spring, the CDC provided an exemption that the VDH has adopted that allows that to be reduced to three foot in an indoor classroom setting. which was encouraging to us and limits the number of kids we have to quarantine. Unfortunately, that exemption does not apply to the bus. And so in the bus, we are quarantining kids in a six foot radius. And so what we're finding based on these first couple of cases is the majority of our quarantines are due to bus riders.\n",
      "unknownspeaker: How did we find out that the children had the infection? Did they come to school and we said, hey, temperature, or did they get a call? Did we get a call afterwards from a parent saying, my child's sick?\n",
      "eileengomez: Mostly a call from the parent. I think we did send maybe one or two kids home with illness symptoms who ended up testing positive, but the rest of them were parents calling it in.\n",
      "rosalynschmitt: And I'll just take that opportunity to encourage families and all these families have have notified us as soon as they've had the results and we've been able to act quickly. And so I just want to continue that message appreciative of those families. I know this is a very hard time for them.

      "catrinasims: That has been very challenging and a lot of teachers have been trying to adjust it in many different ways, but that is the most challenging and it's harder to hear them produce the sound as well as see them make it, but we've also thought about. you know, having students sending them home with mirrors on their own so that they can practice that and then come back to school, then being able to use it. So it's that parent family partnership of being able to teach it. And it's something that you could easily do a screencast and then share that out to families of this is what you should be looking for.

I think at this point, it's been a long work session and everyone's gave a lot of great input. I think what we'll have the planners do is come back to our next committee meeting in October and share with the rest of the committee what was talked about in your small groups. And then the committee will come up with what those top three were and sort of consolidate them. And we would bring that back to the school board as a consent item for consideration.

But I think with the time left, if we could just quickly say to the public, here's what was discussed, maybe just say the three topics. I know my group has five. Just real quickly so that the public can hear it. And then the committee will go back and probably analyze what's realistic for the next year or two. And then pitch that back to you just to get some agreement on.\n",
      "davidstorm: Okay. I'll go ahead from our group, Mr. Page. Okay, yeah, Mr. Snow. Yeah, that's good. Our three primary items were solving capacity issues, whether at the elementary school or the high school level with regard to what happens with center two in particular, and how that may impact the overcrowding at some of the high schools. Also the capacity issues, once we follow out with what happens with both. Crozet and Mountain View, and then looking at whatever else comes next with that. Second piece was modernizing our existing facilities, both to take advantage of modern technology, modern teaching techniques, but also to be able to deal with whatever the next Black Swan event is, whatever the next pandemic type thing might be, so we can be better prepared if we can, right? So it's just one of those things. And then lastly, to try and do it with an eye toward equity to make sure that all our students are getting the best opportunity they can to start once they get into that building, once they get into whatever facility we happen to be using for them, so that we're not, everybody's got the best opportunity to succeed.<|eot_id|>\n",

And we also talked about that, including LGBTQ students. If we're talking about the sort of the building facilities, part of that, we talked about clean buildings, sustainability projects. And we also talked about flexibility for the future, if that, you know, is sort of out of the box thinking in terms of mixing virtual learning with in-person learning, possibly as a way to solve capacity issues. That's a possibility. And then we had a fifth, I don't recall a fifth. I'm sorry, Rosalyn, could you help me with that?\n",

But there was a conversation around rethinking schedules, whether year round schooling and the COVID slide and those types of topics, which I think are all on the front of our radar right now, but may or may not be in the purview of this committee. But we did want to bring it up in the larger group.\n",
      "unknownspeaker: Did I miss anything? I guess I'm the other one. I think probably our highest priority was looking at capacity, but really more focused on Mountain View, which is almost 800 students. And looking at last year, the Long Range Planning Committee talked about a middle school study. It was on our to-do list. We haven't done it. But with Mountain View, close to 700 students, And without space to expand, we actually do need to tackle that problem area at some point. So that's what is the right size for elementary schools? What are we going to do about Mountain View? And how does that fit in with the study of our middle schools? And then because I think there's an opportunity to look prospectively, it is long range planning. is I would like the Long Range Planning Committee to consider looking at the Lambs Lane campus. It is with the school with Albemarle, Greer, Jack Jewett, and soon to be a Boys and Girls Club. It has terrible traffic patterns. It has both the transportation and gas station and building services. But there's an opportunity, I think, to rethink that campus and look at what it could be, even if it's not tomorrow, if it's a 10-year plan. How could we improve that campus and maybe take advantage of some of the parcels that we have proffered to the county and the schools? So it'd be a solve these problems and here's prospectively something we can build on. So in short, pretty easy. Yeah, yeah.\n",

She's always been extremely valuable to me in any decisions that I make. I have to say that I'd be willing to potentially favor, and this is a fine line in terms of the phraseology, I could favor suspending the masking requirement based on the numbers that we're seeing locally and in light of what Mr. McKay is saying about our local situation. But I don't support rescinding the requirement. just yet. Maybe it's trying it. I don't know if another variant or strain is going to raise its ugly head between now and the end of the school year. In which case, I would favor reinstating masking for teachers and staff. But I'm hopeful that in either case, we will be able to not have the requirement for anybody, you know, when we start school again in August. So bottom line, I would say that I'm in favor of suspending the masking requirement in light of local community results, but I think we should kind of not completely wipe it out, just suspend it for the time being and with an eye to reinstating it if conditions require it.\n",

They're adults, they have the chance to be vaccinated. The best argument I heard was Kate's, where in classrooms where students don't have that option, that's probably where I would see more of an argument towards requiring teachers to be masked. I will just say my mom, who is a teacher in Alexandria, which is a bigger, you know, which is more urban setting, they've relaxed their masking requirements. And although at first she was really nervous about it, she has talked about how it has really changed the environment in a way that it feels She doesn't feel less safe, and she appreciates that they were given the option. So that's where I stand. I'm OK. As long as we're abiding by the guidelines that are coming from the Thomas Jefferson Health District or the Health District, then I'm OK with that.\n",

So I feel like we've been in this position before where we all had hope and I am just very concerned about Child of Omicron. son of other Greek letter coming at us. And I just, I want to make sure that that doesn't catch us flat footed. So my tendency would be to keep the masking for now and see if we really can get rid of it at some point.

      "rosalynschm: Hi, good evening again. So as we all know, the school board has been meeting electronically during the COVID-19 pandemic. But in anticipation of the county office buildings lane auditorium opening once again, we would like to present a plan to return to in person board meetings next month. The board of supervisors recently discussed their plan for in person meetings. And so I want to first start with some excerpts from that from that meeting for context. The Board of Supervisors are utilizing a tiered approach for public meetings. In Tier 1, which begins April 4th, members will meet in person and attendees will be in a hybrid fashion. This includes the Board of Supervisor meetings, Planning Commission, and School Board. They will all transition in this first tier.\n",
      "unknownspeaker: These hybrid meetings will be in lane auditorium at the county office building hybrid means that while board members will be in person, the public and other attendees will have the choice to attend in person or participate electronically.\n",
      "rosalynschm: There is a look at what the capacity of the auditorium will be there will be mandatory social distancing on one side of the room for those that elect to sit there and then normal seating available on the opposite side board members will be distance on the diet. So here are just a couple additional details about the school board meeting specifically. The first in-person meeting will be April 14th. That's the next board meeting after that April 4th date. The mask requirement will be dependent on the requirements at Cobb at the time of the meeting. They are currently required now, but we understand that they are monitoring community levels and may change that requirement before then. The meeting will be streamed live on our website, which is the same as our current practice. And the public will have three options to participate in public comment, in person, electronically via Zoom, or by written submission. And Dr. Diggs, our chief technology officer, will speak more about that aspect of the meeting.\n",
      "christinedigg: Good evening, school board members. I'm Christine Diggs, chief technology officer. We are pleased that we can provide the option for public comment to be via Zoom or in-person. For public commenters that choose Zoom, there will be no need for you as board members to open Zoom to see or hear the speaker. Everyone in the auditorium will be able to hear the speaker. The Zoom participant will be displayed on each board member's laptop screen, and the Zoom participant can view the board members via the meeting stream. they will see the ACPS logo that's shown here on their Zoom screen. The Zoom speaker may also need an auditory signal that time is running out as the timer that's at the podium is not loud enough to be heard over Zoom. And in-person public comment will resume with no changes. And with that, we welcome your questions about the return to in-person school board meetings.\n",
      "unknownspeaker: After digs, I think I heard a while back that the Board of Supervisors was going to be testing this process. Have they been doing that? And is it working well?\n",
      "christinedigg: Their technical staff has been testing it, as has our technical staff. They have a different setup than we do.

      "karenwaters: Jennifer, can you click the link where you see the word surveyed? should come open.\n",
      "unknownspeaker: Yeah, okay. All right, so let's see now. With the question, what is your meeting style preference? I would probably prefer at the beginning having groups probably of about 20 people or less. I'd be willing to sort of have the option of either having a zoom meeting or in person, I would be sort of leaning toward in person meetings, but if not, then we'd go with zoom moving down a little bit more Jennifer. A little bit more right in the groups that would be of interest for me would be minorities in Samuel Miller district and also low income families. Those would be the two main groups that i'd be probably trying to work with most in the beginning in my district. And then moving down to the next section, topics of main interest. For me, it would be underrepresented populations at school board meetings. And then as a other, promote and diversify board appointed committees in Samuel Miller District. Quite often, even though we have good appointees, good people that have been applying for positions, I would still like to have maybe a pool that would be able to sort of have more diversity or candidates that would be more diversified to put on some of the committees. And this would be one way, I think, to do that. Now, moving down a little bit more, I think where it gets to the context that you would make. Probably the main contacts I'd be looking at right now would be the PTOs, especially for the two smaller schools in Samuel Miller District, which would be Red Hill and Scottsville, although Scottsville is in the Scottsville District. but still students from my district go there. I'd also be probably looking at the Yancey Community Center group and also probably contacting social service department in order to find out more data that could be used to sort of invite certain groups from the minority group and from the low-income group to that meeting. So those would be the main things and then I'd probably be looking or trying to start this probably in the middle of April right after spring break. So that would be typical answers to the survey for me as an individual. So are there any questions or any of things else or either returning it back to Dr. Harrison, Harrison for other comments? We would love your comments and or questions board members.\n",

      "grahampaige: OK. All right. Thank you. Okay, our next item is the 2022 work session topics. And this will be led by Mishma.\n",
      "unknownspeaker: Good evening again. This is my last item tonight. And this is about work session topics for the remainder of the calendar year. So we formed a work session committee, it was comprised of staff and representative board members, including Miss Lee and Mr. O'Carroll. We have drafted topics for the remainder of the calendar year. Before we get into the topics, I want to first start with the purpose of work sessions. The school board implemented the use of work sessions to gain greater understanding of critical issues facing the division and to provide staff with direction and support in the division's strategic plan. So in other words, work sessions are an opportunity for deeper work. And typically, the first meeting of each month is a business meeting, and then the second meeting is a work session. The committee has drafted a common framework for each work session outlined here. All work sessions will have a direct connection to the strategic plan. They will be data-driven, connect to current policies, and then all will conclude with a common discussion and ensure clear purpose and direction with questions such as, what further information does the board need? What are the next steps for the board on that topic? And always tying back into our funding and budget cycle as well. So there are six remaining scheduled work sessions in the calendar year. And so for each, you will see a date, a topic, and then the connection to the learning for all goal and strategy or objective. And so the first three, which will take us to the end of the school year are listed here. Our next work session is on March 24th, and that will be on what we're calling the first part of two that are focused on achievement data. And the topic will be a mid-year data review. In April, we propose a work session on the CIP. This will be a more global approach on the process and program as a whole and not about specific projects and will be an opportunity to better understand how the county assesses affordability, forecasting, financing options, as well as how we produce enrollment projections and other data. In May, we will plan a session about school climate and mental health. This will include information on student climate data, our counseling and SEL programs, instructors, such as responsive classroom, design development, and freshman seminar. As we come back from summer, right, in August, we will start with a session about intervention services, and that will include RTI, SPED, ESOL, and our title programs. In September will be the second part of the achievement data discussion and that will focus on the year end data. It will also be an opportunity for the board to develop their goals for the 22-23 school year. And lastly, we will conclude with the work session about school board, community and stakeholder engagement. We're still working on the details of these, but we've talked about a deeper dive on the role of advisory committees, perhaps reflection on the work of the work you just discussed or other topics. So with that, I will ask if there's anything Mr. O'Carroll or Ms. Lee would like to add or expand on and then open it up for discussion and feedback.\n",
      "jonnoalcaro: I would say that I now understand what Dr. Harrison was saying to us during the meeting about what the plan was that we just heard during the previous session and how that would relate to that last meeting in October. So that becomes very clear to me now.<|eot_id|>\n",

So I think a lot of those topics that were on that list will end up being. Business meeting topics and then. Because two hours just seemed like a lot for some of them.\n",

      "unknownspeaker: Thank you, sir. At this time, I'd like to introduce Lars Holmstrom, equity specialist who is spearheading this initiative. Lars, would you share a few words with us?\n",
      "larsh(he/him): Sure. Thanks so much, Dr. Hairston and Chief Adams. Dr. Hairston and Chief Adams described four key areas of this partnership agreement. The first recruitment and development of staff with specific cultural competence regarding Virginia Indians. The second accurate respectful and inclusive curriculum with the history and present realities of Virginia's indigenous people in mind. Third, monitoring of success outcomes for Native Indian or Indigenous students. And lastly, student, family, and community partnerships with Native Indian and Indigenous individuals and organizations. Now, I'd like to report that I'm encouraged that we've begun efforts in each of these areas. We've developed and led professional development and community read sessions in partnership with VTech. And I'd like to give special thanks to our VTech educational liaison, Kara Canaday, for her partnership through making connections and so many other opportunities of late. Kara and the local Monacan Indian Nation have also partnered on our curriculum updates, including, but not limited to, elementary reframing the narrative work with social studies lead coach, Neely Reagan. We've developed equity tables that show the landscape of outcomes for students identifying racially as American Indian, with particular attention to career and technical education, an area of specific interest to the Virginia tribes. What I'm most hopeful about, though, are our emerging partnerships with VTech and our local Monacan Indian nation. I'm sharing this brief summary of these startup efforts to point to the fact that our partnerships must be more than words on a page. We are temporary occupants of this land, which has been stewarded by the indigenous people of Virginia for millennia. Moving forward, this partnership agreement represents our commitment to take continued steps to imagine and accomplish our public education, and ACPS holding that knowledge in our minds and hearts, and in communion with the Virginia tribes. Many thanks to Dr. Harrison, Dr. Haas, School Board Chair Graham Page, and the rest of the members, and of course, Chief Emeritus Adams, and the VTech members for this important commitment. Thank you.\n",

And I want to thank Lars for your hard work to pull this together. And Chief Adams, it is an honor and a privilege to be able to sign next to you on that partnership agreement. It's a moment I won't forget, and I will honor it. And I really appreciate you. Thank you.\n",

And as a starting place, one of the priorities for this year is to actually create a directory of all of these student groups so that they have an opportunity to do more recruitment throughout different schools.\n",
      "unknownspeaker: I guess I would also like to ask our student representative, Antrobius, about the level of awareness of students about this work?\n",
      "davidantrobius: Sure. To be honest with you, I haven't heard much of this. I have heard of some of the student groups you mentioned, namely that Asian and Pacific Islander group. I see posters for that all over Monticello. And I think it's got a pretty big presence in the community. So honestly, I think just promoting it among the students directly, the posters are definitely one helpful way. Honestly, I wasn't aware of it, but it's definitely something I'm interested in.\n",
      "onnoalcar: A comment and then a question is that for the five of us on the board who were around when the anti-racism policy was passed, we talked at the time that this did have a long way to go. that this could be a generational progression. This could be the school cycles to get to the point where enough students have gone through it from kindergarten to 12 to have this just be a concept that is inculcated into the culture. and it becomes a routine and part of how these students see the world, see each other. And I'm intrigued, Ms. Fernandez, about your comment about having an assessment done of the program, maybe at the third year anniversary or at some point during the year. Could you expand on that a little bit, please?\n",
      "unknownspeaker: Sure, I'm happy to. I also would like to welcome our policy enforcement chair to weigh in. I'm happy to kick it off. We recognize that we are very attached to this work. And so just to allow for a broader perspective, right? Sometimes when you're doing the work, there is such thing as confirmation bias. And for us, as Dr. Harrison mentioned, we do believe in a growth model. We recognize that we have areas for improvement. And so we believe that having an outside evaluator come in will just allow us to have a different perspective and we can use that information to deepen our areas of growth. Jamie, would you like to add to that?\n",
      "amiegellne: I think that pretty much hits the nail on the head. I mean, we do internal evaluations. I am a program evaluator for the division, but I think somewhere from three to five years out, as Jasmine said, we adopted the policy in 2018. 2019, so we're coming up to three years, but somewhere between that three to five-year mark, it may be good to get an outside perspective to come in and validate some of the work that we're doing.\n",
      "jornoalcaro: Are there groups who do that for this type of a program, or is this a new enough concept that there aren't groups per se that are focused on anti-racism policy implementation?\n",
      "amiegellne: I think that's something that we'd have to explore and put out an RFQ for. But yes, I do think there are groups emerging to do this work.\n",

One thing that I just found curious was the orientation completion rates at various, it seemed not as disparate with groups and departments, but it did seem a little bit all over the board at school locations. And I was just wondering if you had any thoughts about that or if you had any sort of lessons learned about that.\n",

      "katrinacallsen: a hard number for that one are for the the 2% of the black students just so I can put a number on like is that like 30 students I mean how many students took the SAT uh why is african-american uh it was I think it was six of the graduating class um For chronic, thank you. For the chronically absent, I noticed that on the equity dashboard. How did we calculate that last year, given that?\n",
      "chrisgima: We use the state's formula for chronically absent. So those were, it was still the same way of measuring it. The way that teachers took attendance shifted a little bit, but the category or the formula that we used to calculate that did not shift. And so it was students who were marked absent for an entire school day over 10% of the school days they were enrolled.\n",
      "katrinacallsen: Okay. Those are my clarifying questions. I have some other questions later, but I'll let other people speak as well right now.\n",
      "onnoalcar: Dr. McLaughlin, one of the things that I really like in this report, and I continue to really like our equity dashboard for is While I know it's important to be comparing ourselves to other divisions in the state or the state as a whole and the nation as a whole, it's interesting and sometimes it feels good. This last year, it doesn't feel good. But getting into really comparing ourselves to ourselves is where the rubber hits the road. And there are some things, I mean, I'm looking at the life after school numbers that I think were 3.84, 4.2, and four out of five. That's 76%, 80, 84, 80, 80%. So it's like a mid C, two low Bs, and a mid B. And so they're obviously, if you just do it on a percentage basis based on five. And so, you know, I really am looking forward to seeing what that's going to become over the next couple of years, because that's one that we can compete against ourselves. But I will tell you that the equity dashboard, and for anybody listening in who's never really paid attention to it, is one of the great tools that the school division has developed where none of us can run, none of us can hide. It is what it is. And these numbers are not great for this past year, understandably so in many ways. But I love the transparency and the standing up and taking accountability and responsibility.

      " I actually. Thanks. I also appreciate the equity dashboard and I sent this as a message late into the night last night about the equity dashboard is that I think that, you know, Patrick the way that you explained it in terms of, you know, when you see when you compare it to the student population then you can see that there is an equity. But I think that the way that we present that data obscures the magnitude of that inequity and I am not suggesting that that's purposeful but I think that that can be an outcome of that. What I did appreciate about this presentation that you gave tonight was that you did have that one slide. that showed the actual disparity with like the 77% of reading and whatever 65% of whatever the math, I think. And then, so you could see, really, where the big disparities were and truly the magnitude of them and so I just think that while our equity dashboard does share the type of information and the actual real numbers, and I do appreciate that, I think that when they're calculated based on the whole, and you have to do the math of like, okay, so this is 4%, but there are 7%. So you have to sort of think, you just have to do a lot of backward math to figure out what the true magnitude of the disparity is. So I would, put in a pitch for changing it such that we can actually see more easily the magnitude of the inequity.\n",

Right, we have, we have, we saw that that was something that was that was as concerning to us as I think to you. And, and so we mitigated those barriers we took away the cost we took away the need to do it on the weekend and provide your own transportation. So as we start to look at the class of 2022 and 2023. I promise you, you're going to see significant improvement in those numbers that this pandemic year was as. Last year's State of the Division report called it a year unlike any other in terms of just being able to access things like an SAT test.\n",
      "lenosborne: Well, yes, because so many of the SAT opportunities were just flat out canceled last year. I mean, more than half the opportunities in our area were gone. So part of this is on lack of opportunity from the college board position as well.\n",
      "katrinacallsen: And that's worth noting, but I also want to say it's not all SATs. That was just a striking number to say. It's like back to the table where we were showing all the metrics and showing growth. And it's growth, so that's good. But I just want to call attention that at that rate, it will be a whole generation that is missed and beyond. So hopefully we can continue with urgency and know that it's important. And it's not, I can't be pleased with numbers like that.\n",
      "unknownspeaker: That's all. Patrick, I think it's great that we're going to be offering, removing a lot of the barriers for the SATs, but as you know, many kids get some preparation about what to expect with the SATs and they do much better. So that's just something to think about.\n",
      "patrickmclauchlin: Well, just a quick update on that is that we also give the PSATs to all of our students in 10th and 11th grade. And by taking the PSAT, that opens up personalized free SAT prep through the Khan Academy for any student with a college board account. So again, that barrier has been greatly diminished. to get that prep and it's likely, I think, better than, you know, the old Kaplan courses that that we used to offer to kids at incredible expense.\n",
      "unknownspeaker: Well, thank you. You anticipated my question. Do we require the PSAT? I mean, do we, we make sure every student takes it?\n",
      "atrickmcla: Yes. So we, so it The one barrier is if they don't show up to school that day is the only reason they wouldn't take it. But every 10th grader and every 11th grader, we get one day to take it that's assigned by the college board, typically in October sometime. And then every 10th and 11th grade student at the school takes it that day.\n",

We're just starting the fiscal year when we're looking at this. This financial report runs from July through September. And so we just have a snapshot of our expenses during this time period. This is going to be the first year in a while in which we've started off the year with a full set of operations and a full set of students. We are still under hold harmless provisions from the state. So in terms of the numbers of students that come in, it will not affect state revenues. So state revenues will be relatively flat during this time period, at least in terms of what's planned, regardless of the numbers of students that are either increased or decreased. We still do anticipate some lower school revenues, local revenues than we had originally budgeted. But we think that there will be some additional discussion during the General Assembly in which there will be potentially new revenues coming from the state, because the state revenues are at historic levels. And we also have heard that local revenues are extremely strong as well. county revenues and we do think that in terms of the revenue picture that our overall revenues are very likely to be strong for this current fiscal year. We take a look at our expenditures for this fiscal year. Our expenditures, we anticipate to be very similar as to what we've had in the past. Probably better expenditures, probably still fairly strong savings in terms of our overall compensation and benefits, probably not as strong as what we saw during the height of the pandemic because we are returning back to school and we did hire more staff, but we're still having some difficulties in terms of hiring staff. Uh, and, um, so it is very likely that we will see some compensation savings, uh, during this fiscal year. Uh, in terms of our overall operational savings, we still do, uh, have pandemic related, uh, delivery item delivery issues in, in the division. So we may see some savings in those areas as well. So overall right now. with this snapshot of just the first three months of operation for the division, we do think that we're going to be very, very strong in this fiscal year. We do have a very strong fund balance. If you look on the last sheet, it's basically a repeat of what you've seen in the fiscal year 2021 fund balance report. We do have a very strong fund balance, but we're probably also going to have a very good fiscal year this current fiscal year. And I believe if there are any questions, I'd be happy on fielding these questions. Otherwise, I was going to turn this over to Dr. Hollins.

So it would only be one meeting per month ordinarily.<|eot_id|>\n",

      "katherineaculf: OK. I guess the question I have is whether it makes sense given how, whether it makes sense to decouple these extracurricular, these sports and other activities from the stage one paradigm. And we've received almost as many letters on this as any other topic for some time. And many student, I mean, as someone who has promoted all of our efforts toward student mental health, I would be in favor of at least considering decoupling it from stage one and permitting it to go ahead.\n",
      "unknownspeaker: Yes, so would I. I would as well.\n",
      "jonnoalcaro: And exactly for mental health issues, because I've sure heard a lot from constituents about these issues with their student athletes.\n",
      "llenosborne: And my understanding is that everybody who's participating, coaches and all that, are choosing to do this. Correct.\n",
      "jaythomas: Ellen, that is correct. So the athletic directors do the hiring and the coaches can choose not to coach if they didn't want to. And they've worked through that. So the coaches who are there have chosen to be there. Yes, ma'am.\n",
      "davidoberg: For me, and this is tough for me, guys. I'll be honest with you, because there's There's an appearance that if we say, okay, well, we're gonna do sports, we're not gonna have school, that we're saying academic programs are less important than the athletic program. I don't believe that's what any of us believe, but there is that concern that that's what we're telegraphing out there. I'll be honest with you, the number of parents that have contacted me has not a whole lot of impact on me, What impacts me is I've had some pretty concerning emails from students who are expressing, I mean, beyond angst, it is, you're right, Dr. Acob, it's a mental health issue. They need it. So, you know, I'm going to rely on Dr. Haas, but my gut tells me that we should try to figure out a way to let this happen. Because I think for me, the athletics was a big part of my high school and college career. And if we can make it happen safely, I think we owe it to our high school kids to try. I would love to hear from our student rep, Mr. Pilkey.\n",
      "angelpikeychevozhel: OK. I agree with Mr. Oberg and Dr. Acuff that it really is mental health. And I'm a captain on the swim team this year. And I can tell you that it's been a little bit rough going from planning a season to all of a sudden now our first meet won't be till regionals. We're not quite sure if we'll even have a season. My one concern, though, is that as much as I want to play sports, I am concerned about VHSL's mask-wearing policy.

      "jaythomas: It's not a VHSL mask policy. That is, I think a national recommendation that came down without some legal support is my understanding. And so there is, their stance is it's a county decision. So there are some divisions that have required students to wear a mask, and there's others that haven't. I think one of the governor's executive orders says that the athletes and students participating in athletics and things like that do not have to wear masks. So it's, you know, most of the school systems I understand when I'm meeting this morning are not wearing masks. There are some schools in northern Virginia some other places that are asking their kids to wear a mask to participate. Mr. Thomas what is our county policy or does it vary from one school to another with this. With the wearing of the mask? Yes. So with the wearing of the mask, we have procedures in place that coaches have to have masks on at all time, that the students have masks on unless they're actually competing or exercising. If they're on the sideline or resting, they would have their masks on.\n",

      " Yeah, I just wanted to say, I very much appreciate the mental health component of this. I feel like decoupling it from stage three might make sense. But for me, it's hard to get my head around saying that our buildings are not safe for students who have insufficient internet access or who have special needs. or our English language learners, or who we have identified as disengaged. But those that are buildings are not safe for them, who we would have in stage two, but they're safe enough for these activities where the respiration is higher. So to me, and for people looking for voluntarily going into the buildings, that's what stage two offers as well. So for me, it would make more sense to couple it with stage two. I'm not sure. We seem to go from three to one and I don't, I guess we're not really doing two anymore and I don't know if there are major logistical problems with that. For me, the voluntary part of it is not as compelling an argument because the surge, most of the post-holiday COVID surges have been from people doing voluntary activities. And that does affect the rest of the community, not least of which the very taxed healthcare system, which, you know, that data we use in determining stages. So for me, I feel like taking it, doing this during stage one carries with it a lot of cognitive dissonance for me.\n",

      "yanmcka: Yes, of course. So we for right now are in phase one and we'll be moving to phase one be officially within the next week. Announcements about that with more specific details will be provided tomorrow morning from our team. And so in one of our approaches that we're working on with the county schools, county government, And somewhat in partnership with unified command from the city and the county is an approach that would utilize and leverage resources from local government, the schools, and certainly from the health district to develop what we call points of dispensing for employees of the county and of the government and also for teachers. And the idea is that we would increase capacity by having school nurses get trained to vaccinate and approved for vaccination for our guidelines and then work with the county to recruit and identify those from the services who could also vaccinate. What this does for us is obviously provides one of the core groups within priority one B with access to vaccine. But I think more importantly for the community is that it relieves a lot of the stress from our current location and other locations that will be developed for access to the vaccine, providing more appointments for the community at large in phase 1B. So all of this would be happening concurrently and is an approach that we're working on with other schools throughout our district. The idea is that we want to move as quickly as we can, but also be efficient with the resources that we have available to us while also leveraging resources that exist throughout the county and across our district to try to move as quickly as possible and getting more access to the vaccine.\n",
      "patrickmclaughlin: So thanks for that, Ryan. And just a couple of more points I wanted to bring to the board's attention before we open up for questions or comments. When we moved to stage one, we heard someone in public comment tonight talk about the impact on the PSAT test. And that is impacting our PSAT test. And one of the things that's been weighing on our minds is that PSAT testing is tied to eligibility for national merit scholarships. However, I spoke with someone at the National Merit Scholarship Corporation today, and they actually have an alternate means of becoming qualified for that. And that is open to all students, so long as they're able to take an SAT test prior to June 2021. So we've got our fingers crossed that we're going to see more SAT testing centers opening up in the future and that students will be able to take advantage of that. The second comment that came up was about fall graduate students who are planning on graduating at the end of this month, and needing SOL tests, and there are about 11 students who are impacted by that who are going to take an SOL test they need to graduate at the end of the month. And India Han, our division director of testing, immediately started looking for those kids from working with the principals and our testing coordinators. And I've been working with Dr. Haas on developing a plan to make sure those kids have an opportunity to do that, even if we're in stage one. So I think we've hopefully found ways to address both of those issues. And would be happy to open up for questions, comments about the COVID update.<|eot_id|>\n",

It also includes some of our secondary teachers who put in accommodations as well. As we're talking to the principals, the number of virtual opportunities at each school varies based on the student requests.

And I recognize that there are teachers, I mean, if I'm in Brownsville, I may not want to work on the other side of the county. But are we going to have any opportunity to allow people to say, look, I'd like to go back virtual. And there's an extra person who wants to go back in person at Meriwether Lewis. Can we swap? Because if you're doing it virtually, it doesn't really matter where you're going. I understand where it's going to impact you if you're doing it in person. And it seems to me that we could make an exception such that it's not a long-term replacement is just for this year, then you have a temporary transfer, and then you're automatically guaranteed to go back.

      "patrickmclaughlin: That's correct. So our one school with the most students requesting the hybrid was 73. That 73 number, I believe, was the number for hybrid learning.

      "unknownspeaker: Are there any discussions around just the college board in general? I know that since the pandemic they have sort of been a disaster. And I've heard comments about their curriculum not being anti-racist, things like that. Has there been any looking at any of that? What is the exact question? So do we do we like the college board are we are we good on partnering with them and the materials they produce the curriculum they produce for the AP classes are we on board with all of that. We don't have much of a choice with the partnership and the college board. If you're going to offer AP class, that is who offers it. And if you're going to take the SAT, that's who offers it, the PSAT. So we're going to have a relationship with the college board regardless. I think what we're saying and very clearly hearing is we can still have other opportunities with our classes through dual enrollment that are just as rigorous and have a guaranteed transcript and accomplish what we're trying to accomplish or the students and families are trying to accomplish taking the classes. So yeah, of course, there's some problems with any company who you're having to pay to take exams and tests like that. But we're gonna have a partnership with them one way or another, because our kids are having to take the SAT and the PSAT tests as well. So, and you know, a lot of colleges are going test optional now. Well, that's what they're saying, but then they're also telling the families that if you took this test, we will consider it and things like that. So I agree, but I think it's starting to trend in the right direction that you are seeing more schools look at other factors other than the SAT test, absolutely. Jay or Mike, what have other schools that we look to done about limits on AP classes? I mean, is it common? How common is it? What kind of responses have they had? Yeah, so there's, it's all over place. Actually, you're seeing more and more places start to pull private or pull AP classes. Chad Ratliff and I went to a consortium about a year ago. I think it was up at Northeastern University, and there was a lot of private and public schools there. And they said, our teachers can offer curriculum at a high enough level that we don't always have to go through a separate entity, the college board, to offer these classes. And so you're seeing more and more places pull or limit. So it's not uncommon that it's happening. Well, I think that's another, I mean, we are considering limiting it perhaps because of student stress and mental health. But offering the same courses without AP is a different sort of conversation. Well, we haven't gotten any comments from the students or families about the stress of our dual enrollment classes. And again, we say to colleges that when the kids are applying, these are equally the highest level classes that are offered on our campus. And so then it's also, keep in mind, it's a guaranteed transcript. So when you take a class through PVCC, you have a guaranteed college transcript. You don't necessarily have that with the AP. Some schools limit, some may take it, some may not. Your four-year colleges may not all take the college transcript from PVCC or your community colleges, but it's a guaranteed college transcript nonetheless. Just give a quick time check. We have about four or five minutes left in this discussion, and you all will have an opportunity to pick one topic or the other to jump back in and really kind of hash out some recommendations. before reporting back as a whole group. So not to derail the conversation, but just give you a quick time check, about four minutes or so left in this part of the program.<|eot_id|>\n",

And so there have been some teachers who have sent some information with doctor's notes and things like that.

Ms. Drago and Ms. Gairdner both mentioned and we've gotten a number of emails about the verbiage in our policy and also how it's being used. So I just, I wanted to put it to the board to talk a bit, to clarify a bit about what our intention is with that policy in terms of keeping our kids and staff safest. For me, the new guidelines from the CDC designating 15 minutes of contact over a 24-hour period that came out yesterday or the day before, was it yesterday? It just makes me concerned about this idea of respite, as well as the comments, you know, talking about expectations of teachers to set it specifically. And, you know, if that could be used against teachers, or if it's something that they would need to be managing on top of everything else as a part of hybrid learning.

But I don't need an answer for that right now, Debbie, because I don't think that's the purpose of this is to get to that level of detail around it.

I was contacted by a parent this morning who asked if it's not possible to do an antibody test because some people who have had COVID have a certain level of immunity that may be comparable to having had a vaccine. Is that true? And if so, is there a test that could be quantified to say, hey, look, you have the antibodies, and so it would not be necessary to get a vaccine?\n",
      "ryanmckay(he/hi.: Well, I don't know if there's a test, but what I can say is that if an individual has tested positive for COVID, they don't have to quarantine up to 90 days after that incident with COVID. Once 90 days is expired, we would have to put them into quarantine because there is the risk that they would get another infection. So vaccine is really what's going to be the long-term solution to preventing illness, serious health outcomes like hospitalizations or death. So while it may be okay for a while post-COVID experience to have those antibodies, that wanes.

VA or others, we try to get them on there as quickly as possible. But they're updated on a weekly basis, and we'll continue to do that. Always good to check with pediatricians and primary care providers as well, because they also have, obviously, appointments. And I know some of them have really expanded their testing on a day-to-day basis.\n",

      "unknownspeaker: I actually had a related one for Dr. McLaughlin. Those cases that we're keeping an eye on, and maybe Ryan too, do we know where, like, do we have any sense of if there was transmission in the school, where it was happening? Was this a bus situation, a lunch? Like, do we have any sense of that? I'd like to defer that question to Eileen.\n",
      "eileengomez: We have a handful of cases that are from the same class. And it does seem like lunch might be responsible for that because sometimes we'll get a second case of a student who sits near another student during lunchtime.<|eot_id|>\n",

And also appreciate the fact that we, we do seem to do our homework and read the materials and things ahead of time. You know, some of my questions I know get answered before the meeting, and I'm sure others also reach out to staff prior to meetings so that we kind of know what we're talking about when things come up. You know, we've done the reading and asked the questions some, so I appreciate that.\n",
      "kateacuff: Great. Well, I'll go. I mean, so much of what our public comment is and so much of the work that we've done in the past year has been, how do we get our kids back in school? And we've had the bi-weekly COVID reports and the transportation issues and the space issues, but we've still managed to keep our eye on our development of a final strategic plan. of the strategic plan is focused on addressing in concrete ways the achievement gap and centerpiece of that plan is a reaffirmation of our anti-racism policy. And we did this in a very turbulent time. So I'm very pleased that we were able to do that. I mean, something that's really not on the sheet is I think our adaptability in terms of changing information, and I know it's been confusing to many people in the community, and notwithstanding some of the comments, we all do read a lot and study the issues. And we are here to use our best judgment, weighing the benefits for almost 14,000 students and our 2,500 staff. And a given parent might not weigh it in exactly the same way. We hear that frequently. But I think we have a balanced board, and we really do the hard work of making those decisions.\n",
      "grahampaige: I can, I can go next. My two main takeaways, I think, would be sort of overlapping some of the ones that some people have already mentioned. And one would be On our board I think we are really pretty united in terms of our purpose in terms of trying to provide the best education for all of our kids here now mall county. And so even though at times we may not agree on everything. Still, we aren't, we don't become disagreeable, we are still united as a board. And then also my second main takeaway is our ability doing these last 12 months at least to make some really tough decisions under really, really difficult circumstances and to try to move forward with, again, the best interests of our students in mind. So those were my two main takeaways from this year.\n",

One thing that I really come to appreciate about our board, and I think it's really been evident in the past year and a half because we've been in the circumstance we've been in, is that we all come with a very unique perspective. And I think that we are true to those perspectives in a way that is collaborative. I think that the way that our meetings have been structured has given us all the opportunity to really air those perspectives and take others in and think about them. And I think that we've been really thoughtful about that. And I appreciate that. And then on Kate's point, our strategic plan is really unapologetic. And I think that we're united behind it. And I think that's a real strength. Wonderful.\n",

      "kateacuff: Well, I think Jono and I have been in capital improvements meetings for the past two days, but it is an area that I would echo that we need to spend a bit more time rather than at the very end of the year when it comes before the school board. I guess the takeaway for me is although I'm very proud of the work we did in the strategic plan and the urgency that we have expressed to Dr. Haas and the cabinet about learning losses, we now have learning losses conflated with achievement gap and I want us to not wait until the end of the year to see how we did. I mean, I really do want us to have a quicker feedback loop in terms of the progress, substantively what's being done, what needs to be done. Is there anything else the school board can do? I know they're doing early assessments this fall to look at learning loss, but we need to pay very close attention to what that looks like. Thank you. I know that was only one, but no, that was two.\n",
      "unknownspeaker: You were focused.\n",
      "katrinacallsen: I can chime in, please. But I would agree with John on, I guess I would categorize it broadly as public engagement. It's been something that's been particularly difficult this last year because of covid. I know that I haven't been to as many schools or events as I would normally get to. It's been difficult. In the beginning, Zoom made it seem like it was actually easier because you got to kind of pop into things. But I would look forward to in the next year figuring out ways that we could have more engagement with people. Focus on the achievement was my biggest one. And I am basing that on the rubric. The rubric for the evaluation is how to have high performing success and student achievement for all students. And that's one that I think we scored in total fairly low, so just having it as a consistent point of our agenda items and meetings and a focus on the data and metrics and agenda. So at a majority of its meetings, the school board considers agenda items specifically related to advancing student achievement. I think we could work on that, which brings me to my third point, which is something I have heard feedback from various members. And it's something I think we've struggled with for a while is just agenda development and getting sessions and work sessions and items that were passionate about and that we want to hear about. And I know we're doing some work with that. I know Jono and Judy have been meeting to try to get through some work sessions, but we've done various things in the past where we've tried to brainstorm. And I think it's just, there's some lack of clarity around like really what we're doing and how it's done. So those are my three items. Thank you.<|eot_id|>\n",

      " Once again, I'm basically, my second other things with Katrina's, it's the data and action around student achievement. I feel like we're doing that more, we're going in that direction more, and especially with the equity dashboards. I think that will, you know, as those are presented to us, and as we take a deeper dive into those, we'll have a better understanding. of really where we are. I think that's one thing that I don't have a great sense of. I mean, I have some sense of how we're doing and what the problems are, but I'm someone who really likes to get into the numbers. So that's a quality of high-performing boards. So that, and then also in agreement with being out in communities, I feel like very often, you know, we hear from the same sets of people and then their partners. And, you know, I would love for us to be more in the communities in ways that they can trust us, especially like ESOL communities, communities of colors. of color so that we can really understand a lot of the experiences that they're having.\n",

      "davidoberg: And I think john and I and Graham talked about this three or four years ago, we just did never get around to being getting it done. But from my perspective, some of the, some of the things that make our board work is when we go. down to Williamsburg and have the chance to just have a dinner together and not talk about school board, not talk about that, but just talk about our families and what's going on and build those personal relationships. We don't really have a chance to do that inter-board. And so I think it would be worthwhile when the pandemic is over and I'll probably be off the board by then, but for the Duke boards to have a retreat, not a work retreat, but a retreat where you could just get together and sit on a porch and drink a mint julep and just get to know each other. Because I think we've lost some of that and the pandemic has exacerbated that at the very minimum.\n",

      "grahampaige: The only other one that comes to mind, I think, is to make sure that we really communicate to our teachers how much we really appreciate them. I think because of everything that's happened over the last 18 months, some of our teachers might have a pretty low morale right now. And so I think we really need to make sure that we let them know just how much they are appreciated. And so that they can see that it's really coming in a truthful and honest way. I'm not sure how else we can do that, but I think that's something too that we really need to look at.\n",
      "katrinacallsen: One thing. Good. I'm adding on to that one thing that I'd like to see kind of tied together a few things something that we'd implemented right before the start of coven and it never really got off the ground was having coordinated days at each school where to board members would get to go and we bring bagels or whatever treats. And teachers can drop in and talk to us one on one and make their concerns and I thought that was a good program we only got to do it at like three schools and then it stopped but it's like a way to show appreciation and one of the best ways to show appreciation is, you know, give an opportunity for them to actually speak to you about their concerns and not in a public forum which I'm sure a lot of teachers don't want to come and give public comment to make their their opinions and views heard, so I would love to see that re-implemented, and that would tie into my second thing, which is that more public engagement. I would love help on that, and just having things set up for what to do. It's been really odd with COVID, not really knowing when you should be going into a school, and so something I'd like to see growth on.<|eot_id|>\n",

And it was very interesting looking over the slides and getting a feel for what the survey had to say. And then we've raised the subject too of class size. And which has been at or near the top of the list for the community's wishlist for years and years. And so how would you do it? So we talked a little bit about the CIP side of that. And obviously, we're not in a position to make any decisions at this point.

I wanted some more granular data on the student achievement and our impact on student learning and school size and how that is broken up between high school, middle school, and elementary, because we were pretty strong in elementary being we thought elementary would be one of the important areas where you really want to get smaller school size, especially if you have economically disadvantaged students, but I'm curious.\n",

It's mentioned in the statement of the areas of focus, but I don't really see a lot of discussion about, you know, the problems with recycling air that can carry the virus. And then also I had a question about hand washing in terms of how frequent it's being done. I watched the EAB webinar about best practices for returning to school, and they suggested doing hourly hand washing. And I don't see that in here, just entering and exiting rooms. And I don't know how often our particularly elementary school children who are in the same classroom all day will be entering and exiting. So I just wanted some clarification on that and a suggestion of a more stringent policy.<|eot_id|>\n",

      "unknownspeaker: Rosalyn, would you like to comment? Hi, good morning. Can you clarify the ventilation? You just want more specifics on it or just, can you just clarify the comment on the ventilation? Because I agree the importance of ventilation that we, will use both our systems to do that, as you know, our mechanical systems can flush in and out fresh air, but also through use of opening windows. So are you looking for more specifics on that or just sharing that as a point of emphasis?<|eot_id|>\n",

We don't have that on our radar. So that's exactly the kind of thing that we're looking for. We didn't know exactly how much time to allot for that. So it could be. that our discussion here is shorter than we imagined, but you've given the staff places where based on your knowledge and expertise, you'd like them to dive. And we are very nimble right now. It could be that we need to call another meeting in order to have the deeper dive discussion that has the answers to those questions. That's my understanding, Debra and Rosalyn, I'd love your help.\n",

This is our again our beginning document to make sure that we are considering all the things we considered, for example, if If we didn't have ventilation in here, that would, I mean, that's what we're trying to think about. What are the key pieces that we might need to make sure that we're addressing and planning around? But that's, I mean, it's a great statement.

Many of the coaches right now, even with the fall athletes are doing a check and connect like we did back in the school, just calling and checking on them, seeing how they're doing, building that relationship and making sure they're okay. That's a major point that we've talked about with the AVs that they've already started to communicate with the coaches as well. So thank you for bringing that up.\n",

I mean, if we can only do certain actions, if for confirmed cases, there may be a whole category of suspected cases where someone may or may not want to get tested or Anyway, what do we do then?\n",

It feels to me that they would be taking the lion's share of the contacts. doing that kind of work that schools, as I understand it, would not be doing. So you had contact with this person and this person, they talked with us about a partnership that they would need if a child or a teacher had a confirmed case, and they would need the class list for the children that was in that class. So my understanding, Roslyn, please help with this, is that they're doing most the lion's share of the kind of work I think you're talking about?\n",

      "katrinacallsen: I would think the answer would be no. I mean, that was also coming up. I mean, there's legal issues about whether you can even test people who are in jail. Is it an invasive procedure? So I just cannot imagine that we could force our children to... Not absent a higher authority telling us that we can.\n",

      "katrinacallsen: Okay. I guess when I'm seeing this plan. Let me click on me when I'm seeing this plan. Like, it seems difficult. This seems like kids are going to be out of school a lot. It seems like this is gonna be hard to implement and maintain. And I guess, so I think we need to be thinking, I know we're putting a lot of effort into this and we need to be, but I want to make sure that we're putting as much effort, if not more, into how are we gonna, like, what is this really gonna look like? Which is kids coming, being at home mainly, so we need to have a robust at-home learning program. We've had a lot of parents write in about, how even just doing the every other day is that's really, really hard to manage. And a lot of families are not going to be able to, to do that. And so I'm not making it super clear, but I just want to look at not lose sight of the forest for looking at the trees, because the reality is, I think this is going to be incredibly difficult and not play out. To be frank, and it's probably true for every school division, not play out very well. I mean, come winter, every kid's going to have a runny nose in elementary school. So what do we, you know, Well, I will say that we're already been working with staff.\n",
      "deboracollins: Actually, the last week of school, we pulled teachers together to begin to work very clearly on courses and engagement and the kinds of things that we want to make sure are in place for the first day of school. So that work has already started. We have teams and teams of teachers coming in already and working probably as we speak. on those kind of plans and those kind of documents. So we have taken any moment that we have to get ready and to start that kind of thinking. We're putting together templates and exemplar courses so that teachers can have those as they begin to build their courses this summer. One of the mandates for the PD this summer is those kinds of professional development so that they're developing that blended learning So what it looks like to be also to be synchronous and not asynchronous, um, I, we think we'll, um, begin to answer and help our students with schedules at home if they are at home.\n",

And to be frank, to speak in frank terms, I think, and when we get to the sort of mental health component, it's going to be important to realize that there will be waves of deaths. And those might be of, you know, our teachers our own students. So I think when we look at this, it can't just be mechanical and I know it's not, but I just, I think we just need to keep that all in mind that there will be things that we can't exactly predict, but we know might happen that will really affect our community.\n",

So that's part of the design of what we've done this morning, Jano, if I've got that correctly. Indeed.

One of the things that we know when we're looking at the high-risk categories is I do not have the specifics for numbers.\n",

And one of the things that I also know is that just because a person is in a high-risk category, we can't force them to not work. So one of the things that we're going to have to do as we move forward is we're really going to have to work with our, our intention is for our supervisors to work with the staff, all staff, to determine are there underlying conditions that are going to prevent them from coming into work. if they are they going to feel comfortable coming in? Is that something that they are planning to do? We're developing a list of questions that will become guiding questions that our supervisors will work with their staffs on to determine what their actual needs are. This is something that once we have a better sense of what we talked about, learning more about our students and who's coming back that will also help us help guide us with what we're going to need staff wise to support those. And from there, what we will do is one of the things in the document, it talks about some accommodation and obviously you know virtual is an easy accommodation or relatively easy accommodation for. for teachers, but you're exactly right. That does not apply for other staff members. We've talked about, are there ways to reassign people to other situations that may allow them to do work that they may not have been able to do in their original job?

      "clarekeiser: So this is all part of this document. So the sharing of this document is the initial time that they are getting access to this information. Obviously, just like the need to communicate very clearly with the parents about their students' return to school, we will need to do the same with the staff as well and make sure that we've got things very much laid out for them. the idea of having something in a concise place where they can go and look for answers is gonna be very important. And so this is the beginning of the communication around that. And just so you know, the press release from yesterday was also shared with all staff members through the compass, which is our mechanism for communicating with all of our staff members. Claire, if I may, it's great to have a handbook or a single source where people can look, but I would encourage from a public health communications perspective to also have posters and reminders everywhere in the schools and the bathrooms, on the buses, because people do forget, especially. We've definitely talked about signage.\n",

I know that in the past, like three months, I've tried to buy a thermometer and I have not been able to.

So we're just trying to think about ways that we can get items that students need in their hands So thermometer starts looking like a backpack or a pencil or the things that we typically make sure that students have to start school.

      "unknownspeaker: Jay, do you want to talk about what the group talked about? And then I can talk a little bit about some of the things we talked with the health department about?\n",
      "jay: Absolutely. So again, we were, you know, I'll go back to kind of what Roslyn was talking about a little bit earlier with this, but we, We talked about looking at the legality, whether we could force kids to wear them or not. Interpretations of CBC have been working with our school nurses and groups. And what our group talked about was encouraging kids to wear masks, having masks available at the school if kids wanted to wear one but didn't have one. And as well as, you know, in addition to wearing the mask, you also have the social distancing aspect or the physical distancing aspect within the classroom as well with that, Judy.\n",
      "unknownspeaker: So the bottom line on that is encouragement.\n",
      "deboracollins: When we talked to the health department, we were somewhat stronger when riding the bus because that you can't social distance there. We know that you can't be more than six feet apart. so that we're looking into being able to think about it in terms of the activity and not just, you know, everybody has to wear a mask all day long for everything you do. So trying to be very thoughtful about when and where. 10 students in a classroom that can social distance, how much mask wearing do you need to think about? And of course, that also depends on the age of this child. So there's, you know, lots of different pieces of this that we're going to have to land on the mask wearing part. And then, of course, Ross will chime in with what we can actually compel and what we can't. Well, I'm going to say, I'm sorry, Ms.\n",
      "rossholden: Lee. What I was going to say is that with respect to staff, as a condition of employment, we can require wearing of masks, especially if the teacher is going to be within six or seven feet of the student. On a bus, because we have layered mitigation measures and because transportation is different than providing education, we may have more latitude about requiring mask wearing on the bus as a condition of being allowed to get on the bus. With respect to in school, the guidance of the state so far is to recommend wearing of masks. We do have communities who may be very interested in having their children wearing masks, especially older children, and there may be some who do not. This is another legal conundrum right now because the laws really haven't caught up to our situation. And it is, I will tell you, in many meetings with school board attorneys around the state, this is something that's being debated right now. As Ms. Collins pointed out, it's a recommendation to wear the mask. And there really hasn't been a determination, and maybe as Mr. Oberg pointed out earlier, maybe it's going to require a higher authority to say that this is going to be a requirement of participating in our public schools.<|eot_id|>\n",

      " But right now... I would say, I know that we're going to be surveying parents and asking about, you know, whether you plan to send your child to school. For me, that hinges on whether kids will be wearing masks. Because I know that even with ventilation, even with social distancing, and I think requiring children to social distance is, I mean, that's going to be hard to enforce. So I think knowing where we are with that at that moment when we survey is going to be important to say, hey, we'll be encouraging, but that's all we can do. So I just want to be sure that when we communicate with parents that that's key.\n",

And one of the guiding questions is, how will we know where our students are in their learning? We didn't, of course, have SOLs this year. I know at least one state has already canceled their standardized testing for next year. How will we know? I mean, the numbers that were given in that webinar you know, we're looking at two to five years, perhaps, to catch up. So how will we know where our students are, and particularly our most vulnerable students for learning loss?\n",

      "unknownspeaker: Debbie, do you want to speak to that? Absolutely, I can speak to that. Actually, we have some tools around that. Schoology has tools around that. We have a program tool called Illuminate that allows us to do that. Our Seesaw for an elementary school is really a portfolio. So we actually, that one piece of our assessment, balanced assessment portfolio is well built. So that's, I mean, we've been doing that probably over the last five years of how do you build a balance assessment? How is it not just a multiple choice and true false kind of assessment? So those tools allow us to do that. The other piece I would add to Ms. Kastner's comment is one of the things that's happening with the professional development is for each unit that the teachers are teaching, they are coming in with a pre-assessment. So that's a pre-assessment, not necessarily of what they're going to teach, but the foundational pieces that should be in place as students go into that new content. I think you'll see a comment on mastery learning. That's best practice. It's something we've been moving towards and trying to get to. But this is one of those opportunities to magnify that and talk really quite well about what are key points, what is the student mastering in this, and be very diligent in our learning continuums. The skills that are needed, but the concepts and the processes that are needed to are spelled out very clearly for students. Sometimes those are hidden to students, but we're working very clearly and consciously on making those visible.\n",

We had ESL teachers working with our students one-on-one even throughout COVID. And what we learned was those learning partnerships were key in helping the students feel successful with their learning. And the teachers also emphasized that their level of creativity was robust during COVID-19 because they wanted students to be able to demonstrate their mastery in multiple ways.

      "allisonlinney: Matt, did you want to add anything before I move on?\n",
      "unknownspeaker: Oh, me? Yeah. Well, I think that it's not an if, it's a when. There will be an uptick with having that number of students coming back and also all the staff that are associated with them and all the various people that are in support roles at UVA. My sense from what I've been taking away from the Virginia Department of Education weekly meetings that we've had is right now the plan from the governor's office is to say, you know, at some point we're going to be in phase three and we don't have a phase four. It's phase three and then it's every man for yourself. And, um, so school systems are going to be trying to figure this out. Uh, the, the role of the, of, of the governor's office in closing all the school systems in Virginia, I, I don't know how this sounds, but it wasn't about schools. It was about flattening the infection curve so that hospitals had time to catch up on the cases during a scenario where the federal government was lacking in terms of providing testing and all the other things that we needed. So it was not about schools. It was about flattening the curve for Virginia. I think there's a lot of celebrating going on right now that the curve got flattened. And so it's like, OK, so now you're going back to school, make up your plan. Our plans are not going to be approved by the Virginia Department of Education. They're going to be read. And they're going to provide feedback to us if they feel like there's some aspect of the plan that we haven't covered. So it's going to be, you talk about challenges. There's certainly all the technical challenges and all the pieces. I think our staff has done an outstanding job of addressing. Then there's just going to be the part about the community in a situation, again, very similar to where we were in March, where there will be infections, there will be issues presented with that. How will we move forward? And I think our best bet is to continue to work very closely with the Thomas Jefferson Health District and work with them to do what's best for our students, our staff, and our families. So that's kind of my overarching look at it is that we're now We're now holding the ball. Every school system in Virginia, all 133 of us are going our ways, and we're going to try to figure it out. That's kind of how the VDOE works in terms of how they do things.\n",

And I, I understand this difference in our agenda today, but I do want to register my frustration that what was a two hour discussion was changed to two and a half minutes with just 10 minutes of notice. Um, and it really goes to a feeling that I have about our meetings in general, in which we are often surprised with detailed information, uh, that I personally would like more time to process, um, and give thoughtful feedback on, um, so, and I know that we will discuss our meetings in PD at some point, so I'll have comments then. Secondly, um, Where I am right now, I really urge us as a board to not look at our county as somehow immune to nationwide issues. I've gotten that feedback from a couple of folks and I recognize that we prioritize being an anti racist division and I applaud us for that. But we do still have the same stubborn outcome gaps as do other divisions. And as you saw also on the data that I sent last night, we still have the same types of issues with placing police where there are more lock and bound students. The daily progress has reported, um, that we have the same types of disproportionate minority contact and Elmore County as do other municipalities. So I really urge us not to disregard nationwide research as something that we think just doesn't apply to us. Um, thirdly, I really appreciate the speed with which the staff has been able to bring together. a review, but I again caution us on mistaking a lack of problems in a survey over the summer to meaning a lack of issues. And Mr. Oberg mentioned this before. So I'm also curious, because I did not catch this yesterday about how this stopped being an independent review. It still feels like we're looking from the inside. And that's always hard to judge. So that's what I got.\n",

Jono sends an email. My child may know who Jono is and his child's friends will know who he is. But for a lot of our students, that's just that's just a random, I mean, it's a random thing. And I don't know that you get the best honest response to somebody because I mean, and I know if I get a random question on a poll, my response might be very different than it would be if one of you guys asked me the same exact question. the relationship we have, I'm going to be more honest. I just, I get the impression sometimes the, and I'm not saying there's a better way to do it. I'm not criticizing.

A defiant student doesn't need a police officer. They need an administrator or a teacher dealing with that. And if the teacher can't deal with it, the administrators deal with that.

We just voted in the earlier part of this hour not to have students back in the buildings until September 8th. So we do have time to do a good job looking at all the background information and give the staff some time to pull together what resources or options we may want to make decisions on. And secondly, having a later date would permit Nick King who directs that program to participate. And I think just that would be good to be able to question him and get his input on it as well. And just take notice that We have received a lot of letters on both sides and a significant subset were in favor of keeping the SROs. So I think we need to do, I like the, I thought, and I may well be wrong, but that we had directed, had a resolution motion last time to direct the superintendent and staff to look at the SRO program and consider options. but not outright getting rid of it as of last meeting.

      "katherineacuff: I prefer Ross's draft, but if we would go with Judy's, I am Very concerned about having a drop dead deadline of July 9th when we're asking. We just voted in the earlier part of this hour not to have students back in the buildings until September 8th. So we do have time to do a good job looking at all the background information and give the staff some time to pull together what resources or options we may want to make decisions on. And secondly, having a later date would permit Nick King who directs that program to participate. And I think just that would be good to be able to question him and get his input on it as well. And just take notice that We have received a lot of letters on both sides and a significant subset were in favor of keeping the SROs. So I think we need to do, I like the, I thought, and I may well be wrong, but that we had directed, had a resolution motion last time to direct the superintendent and staff to look at the SRO program and consider options. but not outright getting rid of it as of last meeting.

I'm grateful for all the data and research that was pulled together. And again, I know that, you know, we're dealing with back to school and we're dealing with calendar and we're dealing with Boys and Girls Club. We're dealing, I mean, And then also other things that generally happen in the summer. So I appreciate the work that went into that. I also, I read all the research last night and I found that, you know, the EAB report, which is the only sort of independent component of this was pretty telling that the positive statements were inconclusive. There was inclusive evidence. to any of the positive statements, and then negative statements had conclusive evidence. So I still, you know, I read that, I read the resolution, and that's how I ended up with the amended draft.\n",

      "katrinacallsen: Yeah, and I also in my mom's group heard some people expressing, I mean, maybe I'm wondering, an important part of this is conveying things adequately to the public because I heard parents wondering, You know, they think that we already have a daily police presence. And I don't think we do. Like, we only have five SROs. Your elementary school right now, there is not a police officer monitoring elementary schools. We are not taking that away. Because there were parents that were like, well, yeah, I do want it. And they pull it. But I'm like, it was never there to begin with. I don't think. But I don't know. I'd be.\n",
      "matthaas: You're correct. So there are five. And actually, at one time, Right around the time I came to the county in 2004, there were more school resource officers than there are now because there was one in each high school and then there was also one in each middle school. And then during the recession, when the local government and the schools lost a significant amount of funding, the SRO program was reduced and it went down to three. And then over time we added back one so that there would be a school resource officer to be at Murray High School and also kind of work at Burleigh kind of because they're close to each other. And then another one was added not too long ago to be another police officer at Albemarle High School because there are 2,000 students at Albemarle as opposed to 1,000 at Monticello and at Western. And also, they wanted to be able to have a police officer that could kind of circulate among the elementary schools and middle schools in the Northern feeder pattern without not having one at Albemarle while that person was out and about if they needed to be. I think that for the elementary schools, the most times when police might come to an elementary school is when there's like a heads up that there's going to be an upset parent that maybe has once a better custody arrangement and can't seem to get it. That's that's typically when I'll hear like you know that a police officer has an SRO has been deployed to go to one of the elementary schools is because a father or a mother or someone has said I'm coming to the school tomorrow and I'm going to take my child whether you stop try to stop me or not. That's typically like how that might come about. But to to the point that several board members have made, there's not a, in fact, I think one of the things that Dr. Acuff was arguing for was a greater accounting of the police presence at the schools because while they are assigned to be at the high schools, they're often not there because they're in training or because they have other uh, responsibilities that the police expect them to fulfill. Um, you know, they're not at the school every day. They're not, um, they're sometimes for a good part of the day because they've had to go to court or something like that. And I think one of the ways that, um, that you might rationalize that is because we, we pay for half of a police officer and the County pays for the other half. So, they're just not going to be there 100% of the time. So that was another thing I think that was sort of holding up our negotiations back and forth with the police department was we wanted greater accounting for the time that the police were in the schools. So anyway, that's just a little bit of perspective.\n",
      "unknownspeaker: Thank you. So let me do a bit of a time check and find out, would you all, is there any additional guidance you need to provide the staff or ask questions? Are you ready to discuss a resolution? Help me know what you'd like to do next.<|eot_id|>\n",

      "jonnoalcaro: Yes. OK. The one other comment that I did, I did want to make on the resolution that Judy did is I had a challenge with and happy to be shot down on this with the last paragraph, starting with resolve that the school board directs the superintendent. and goes in to examine the draft SRO MOU that's been under negotiation, whether it provides a model for further consideration, explore other security, et cetera, et cetera, is I would like to have that in there because if we are going to develop and maintain a relationship with the police department, we've talked about this, I know before, that there's going to need to be some memorandum of understanding so that the protocols for dealing with the different schools, the contact people, you know, the layouts and all of that. I somewhat resist abandoning the draft MOU, not because it should be, you know, implemented as is, but so that it could be a starting point Because there's a lot of good content in there. And there's some things that need to be changed. There are some things that probably need to be omitted. Well, need to be omitted. But I just don't think we should abandon that. And that's what I'm interpreting this draft to say.\n",
      "davidoberg: HAB-Michael Leccese, moderator, I think the language that was excluded actually. I think it just, and. Lawyers will always screw things up. And so I don't want to screw anything up. But I think simple is better. And there was verbiage in here. I mean, I think this actually gives the superintendent greater latitude, but with direction. I don't want to tell the superintendent what he has to do, how he has to do it. I just want him to understand that my goal is this.\n",
      "katrinacallsen: I agree with Dave. with on that. I think there's been a lot of confusion in our conversations about what we really want Matt to do because we had that existing MOU. I don't think taking it out excludes having an MOU. Correct me if I'm wrong, Jonah, but it sounds like what you're saying is we do need to have a memorandum of understanding. I don't think this is saying we're not going to have a memorandum of understanding, just that we need to make, and Judy, maybe you don't want one, but I like that it's crisp and it gives the direction that this is the end goal we want and that old MOU is not created with those goals in mind. And so they can still use it as a starting point as they move forward. But yeah, I don't read it as saying that we're not going to have an MOU or that they can't use it as a starting point.\n",
      "jonnoalcaro: I'm happy to stand corrected on that. I just want to make sure that they're not precluded. from using that as a starting point because that's the main thing that I want to make sure of is that that can be used because there is, there's good verbiage on some topics in there that I think would be invaluable to us going forward. So if it's not excluded, then I'm happy to bow to the other members of the board. I think we're good on that one, John.<|eot_id|>\n",

I mean, they can use whatever they would like to, but it just seemed like so much of it hinges on a daily police presence. And that's the one thing that we're asking to remove. So I mean, I think they're probably, I'm sure there will be an MOU, but again, we're just asking for something to happen and however they want to do it. That's, I feel like that's not really up to us.\n",

      "katrinacallsen: I'm okay with serving the parents because I guess you never want to turn down additional information. But I would caution my only fear with the surveys is that the whole issue that we're looking at is how minorities feeling. And so when you get these surveys, you're going to get a majority response. It seems really positive, like, oh, I mean, I don't know. But you could get a response that's like, oh, most people really like this or I was and how they're doing. But the thing is, we're not asking what most people experience are. We're focused on a small subset that's like the purpose. And I'm sure we're all aware of that. And I'm fine doing an additional survey. But when I was looking at the data that was presented to us, I just wanted to keep that in mind, that although maybe only 15% had a really negative opinion of the interaction, it's important to break that 15% down.\n",
      "davidoberg: To me, Katrina, the 15% is maybe our wrong way to approach this. But to me, 15% of our students having a problem, is far more important to me than 85% not. The people who are most in need are the ones that we need to address. And if it's copacetic for everybody else, then I don't know how desperate their need is.\n",
      "matthaas: Yeah, and I think that's a great point to make is that Dr. Kastner used to say when he was superintendent that the students and families that we're most likely to help in the work that we do, we may never hear from them. And then, so I think that's a good point. Whenever we look at these surveys, and my staff is well aware that whenever we look at them, there are many limitations to surveying, and so I think Looking at them as just one piece of a communication puzzle is really the best way to look at them. It's often helpful, but as I tell people, it's not a vote. It's just trying to gain a better perspective than what we might have just by hearing anecdotes. Whenever we say, I mean, we toss around things like 10%, 15%, and it does seem small, but 10% of our students is a school that's bigger than Monticello or bigger than Western.\n",
      "unknownspeaker: It's 1300 of our kids.\n",
      "matthaas: Yeah, that's oftentimes if I look at that, I say, well, that's my achievement gap. That if I've got 500 students that go to school and have a chilling effect of any kind, whether it's by seeing you know, a confederate image or maybe they're upset because of the presence of some type of adult staff in the school or something that impacts their learning negatively. From a pragmatic standpoint, that's your achievement gap. So these decisions are not just window dressing, you know, changing the name of a school or of reframing how we look at our interactions with the police department or any of the agencies that come and go from the schools. I really respect the work of the board in this area. Thank you, Dr. Haas.\n",

Even at this late hour, however, I propose that Dr. Haas include in his funding request to the board a five-year overview of the capital needs of our schools. The statute that requires a superintendent to make a funding request is not specific that it's limited to operating costs, and in fact, many other school divisions include both in the funding request. And I think that we ought to be in that category, that a way to elevate our capital needs, both to the supervisors, but even more so to the community is to include the needs of our capital. You've all heard me speak with some alarm that we now have about 100 classrooms in trailers. We have a very aging infrastructure. The average age of our core school is over half a century old and they're not set up in many cases for our 21st century teaching. So I guess I propose this. I would like to have a consensus up the board and an assurance from Dr. Haas that this is feasible at this late hour.\n",

Just some feedback to you, Maya.\\nkatherineacuff: It was really good, actually, having these groups with the long-range planning committee members.

So thanks, Maya, and also thanks to the Long-Range Planning Committee members who were with us tonight. Is that it, Maya, anymore? That's it. OK. All right.

I know that we talked about how UVA students, they're having the cases increase there at UVA and that it doesn't really affect us here in the county, but I'm curious about the count of UVA students that we have in working in our schools, who would be working in our schools if we opened them back up.\"}"
