       "\"cally about what we do if we end up changing our policies. ahead of time, so I think I really want to express appreciation for how you've addressed EO2. And just want to kind of how thoughtfully you have gone about protecting our students over the past two years, because I really greatly appreciate how well you've protected my son. I also want to appreciate how well you've taught diversity and history. And I hope that you guys continue to kind of think about the diversity curriculum in terms of how you teach it within our schools to make sure that they're prepared for facing the greater world. going forward, because I think it's really important that we prepare our children to really be aware of different cultural backgrounds other than our own, so that when they go to college or go to graduate school, they're fully prepared. And I'm not sure if EO1 will really prepare us for that. Thank you. I appreciate your time.<|eot_id|>\\n\\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\njonnoalcaro:\""
