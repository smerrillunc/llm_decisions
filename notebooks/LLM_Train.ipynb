So the ones that we have put in front of you already are the evaluations, both the board self-evaluation and the superintendent evaluation, the recovery of learning phase and the logistics and planning behind the new strategic plan that's going to come up. But again, the board really should play a significant role in determining the agenda for this retreat. And so I guess I would open it, I'd like to open it back up to the board for thoughts on that. Are these the right agenda items right now? Are there other things that you would like to get on there? And if we're going for a half day part one, what would you like to see in part one?

I think recovery of learning phase and the strategic plan are the two more important. And I would maybe put recovery of the learning phase in the June 5 meeting and then strategic plan later. But it could be either way. I just don't want an hour and a half of learning phase and an hour and a half of strategic plan. I think we need to do a deep dive into each of these.<|eot_id|>\n",

But I think it was on May 7, 2020, nearly 40 school board meetings ago, the acronym COVID for students and families, our staff, and our broader community has been the board and for our entire school division. The good news is that while there has been some 185 confirmed cases of COVID among our students, staff, and school, there have been few cases of virus transmission inside our schools. Today, nearly three out of four of our eligible students are fully vaccinated, and in the first few weeks of our vaccination clinics last spring, nearly 2,000 of our employees received vaccines. In little over one week, we will open our schools to more than 13,000 students. with the confidence that the mitigation strategies and practices we have implemented relating to cleaning, air quality, spacing and masking are under continuous review, as well as new policies being considered, all are designed to keep our students and staff as safe as possible and to permit in-school learning. An important resource for these achievements has been a volunteer advisory panel of medical experts who have unselfishly donated their time and expertise in keeping our educational community safe. For example, they review our mitigation plans and strategies for sufficiency. They provide real-time evidence-based data and information that allows us to deal with a myriad of challenges. They support our vaccination efforts, including volunteering at our clinics and communicating with our families. They join public meetings like this one to discuss COVID protection practices. They directly support our school nurses on triage decisions, and they are nearly always available to deliver ongoing counsel to school administrators and to the members of this board as we continue to navigate the challenges of COVID. I'd like to publicly recognize this superb team of medical experts, which includes Drs. Jeff Vergalis, Paige Perriello, and Carlos Armengol. Before asking each of our guests to say a few words, I know we will be sending letters of appreciation to each of you and to the members of our Student Health Advisory Board. I want to tell you how grateful we all are. for your public service and for the lives you have helped protect against the COVID-19 virus. We have a COVID update shortly on our agenda, but we will welcome some thoughts from our medical experts on the current challenges we face.

      "katrinacallser: So is that our target. just at the beginning of February. I'm wondering if that's the target.\n",
      "patrickmclaughlin: That was the original target when we were using December 10th as a decision point. With the shift to January 21st as a decision point, we're not quite sure we can get things turned around by February 1st to have things ready to go if we got the green light to go back. So if there's feedback from the board about that timeline, please send it my way and we can discuss that in cabinet as well.\n",
      "katrinacallser: Yeah, I guess my little piece of feedback is just, I guess maybe I should talk with you because I'm just kind of curious, not curious, but I'm kind of concerned, I guess, about backing off of our timeline. I get the rationale, but then to say that it's not even going to line up to when we're having a semester shift in high school is, I guess, a little, and then to hear that the city is pushing for earlier decisions, not that we need to do that or that's right and haven't even voted on it, but I guess I just have some concerns about why we would try to be aiming to switch things in mid-February. Like, why is that the date that we're shooting for? Seems like February 1st at the very least would be the date that we needed to have a decision, but I could be alone in that thinking.\n",
      "kntierivaacuft: Just following what Katrina has just said, I mean, I know that the 14th of January is our organizational meeting, but is there a reason that we couldn't, like, if that were a decision meeting, then the February 1st date would be more feasible, perhaps. Just a thought.\n",
      "patrickmclaughlin: So again, we can take feedback on that timeline. If it's the board's request to receive the superintendent's recommendation and have discussion and decision the same evening, we could potentially make that alignment.\n",

      "matthowhaas: Matt, you look like you had something to say. I would just offer that part of our consideration for slowing down the process was that out of consideration for teachers, because they are just now, like a lot of the feedback we received on the last time that we made a recommendation and move forward on it was that the teachers had just been starting to hit their stride with virtual and that it was very disruptive. And so we were just trying to be sensitive and not all of a sudden ramping things up again to make possibly another recommendation. And so we decided to take our foot off the gas with that respect. I do understand, however, the sense that it may be, might be too long. You know, another alternative could be to front load and have a special meeting to make the recommendation the week before the 14th. It would still give a considerable a considerably large amount of time to pass between yesterday and when we would firm things up for recommendation to the board. It would also allow for Dr. McLaughlin and his team to put together a very concrete explanation of what stage four would look like for the December meeting. So it'd be really clear to everyone. We could then address questions and get feedback to continue to improve it. If we had a meeting on January 7th with that being the only Agenda item, it would be after the winter break. So people would be back in town to attend to it. And then we could do that. And then the next week, the board could act on it. That's another alternative. That's a compromise between the two concerns. Because if we were able to have a decision on the 14th, and all this is supposing that we would recommend stage four, I want to reiterate what Dr. McLaughlin said is that that's not a foregone conclusion. If we did do that, it would give us still a fair amount of time to get things in order to start on the semester break.<|eot_id|>\n",

The challenges we have, as you know, is a very large county with lots of transportation needs. So one of the things, if you go back to our timeline, We need to determine from our parents what their interests are. If we have parents that do not require transportation, they say, I do not want my child to ride the bus, then that allows us to do different options than if we're transporting the same number of children we transported right this year in March. So there's still a lot of input. to making decisions about how often we can have how many children in school buildings.<|eot_id|>\n",

      "deboracollin: Then I think that's part of the virtual option that would be there. We also can offer homeschooling to parents. I mean we have several options that we help parents navigate. So it could be a blended learning. You're going to come to school some and be virtual some. You're going to choose a virtual option and move along with the class or you can be homeschooled and that allows a parent to go to purchase, provide, to think about their own sources of curriculum.

How many crimes? I just don't know. What are we doing with that data? Cause what are we comparing it to? Or kind of questions I have, but I assume we're going to talk about this tomorrow once we've got a chance to look at it.\n",

      "katrinacallsen: Yeah, so my other business piece, and I had the chance to talk to a few of you guys on the phone, is just that speaking about taking the time to digest things and look at our data and evaluate, when we made the decision about Confederate imagery a year ago or at the start of the school year, the goal was to go back and see if we needed to take any further action. And I would like to respectfully request that we do so. I think there's a lot that could be said about it and probably more eloquently by some of our other board members. But just from my role as an assistant city attorney, I can say that I don't think we're escaping any kind of liability by not taking action when we already effectively are banning it through our superintendent. And we're opening ourself up to a lot of optics problems and beyond optics. We're sending a message to our students. It's really easy to resolve since we already are not allowing students to wear Confederate imagery. And I think it's time that we make a resolution and move on. So I don't think we can make a motion at this meeting for something like that, although I am confused because we did make a motion for the holiday at the beginning.

But I think it was on May 7, 2020, nearly 40 school board meetings ago, the acronym COVID for students and families, our staff, and our broader community has been the board and for our entire school division. The good news is that while there has been some 185 confirmed cases of COVID among our students, staff, and school, there have been few cases of virus transmission inside our schools. Today, nearly three out of four of our eligible students are fully vaccinated, and in the first few weeks of our vaccination clinics last spring, nearly 2,000 of our employees received vaccines. In little over one week, we will open our schools to more than 13,000 students. with the confidence that the mitigation strategies and practices we have implemented relating to cleaning, air quality, spacing and masking are under continuous review, as well as new policies being considered, all are designed to keep our students and staff as safe as possible and to permit in-school learning. An important resource for these achievements has been a volunteer advisory panel of medical experts who have unselfishly donated their time and expertise in keeping our educational community safe. For example, they review our mitigation plans and strategies for sufficiency. They provide real-time evidence-based data and information that allows us to deal with a myriad of challenges. They support our vaccination efforts, including volunteering at our clinics and communicating with our families. They join public meetings like this one to discuss COVID protection practices. They directly support our school nurses on triage decisions, and they are nearly always available to deliver ongoing counsel to school administrators and to the members of this board as we continue to navigate the challenges of COVID. I'd like to publicly recognize this superb team of medical experts, which includes Drs. Jeff Vergalis, Paige Perriello, and Carlos Armengol. Before asking each of our guests to say a few words, I know we will be sending letters of appreciation to each of you and to the members of our Student Health Advisory Board. I want to tell you how grateful we all are. for your public service and for the lives you have helped protect against the COVID-19 virus.

Our average weekly attendance for our elementary students was 1,360 students, with our highest numbers in our primary grades K and one. Our weekly average for our middle school students was 685 students, which is approximately 300 students more than we served at our middle schools in the past years. Our highest attendance numbers were in the sixth grade. For our high schools, we had approximately 450 students earn a new credit and 315 students recover credits from the 2020-21 school year.

I guess I'm interested in stronger language and stronger policy or stronger action around lunch, because it seems like an unmasked time. I was a little dismayed to hear that people will be eating in their classrooms, because when they talked about alpha transmission, it was like 15 minutes.

I'm hoping to begin that process within a week from now so that we can have accurate records on who is vaccinated and who is not. And at that point, we will begin reaching out to those who are not vaccinated to start the process of getting their weekly tests or getting the process to be vaccinated. I wanna encourage all of our employees, if you are listening tonight or if anyone reads The news released tomorrow that if you are not vaccinated, that please contact our human resources department to start that conversation and start that process.

This evening, we have the privilege of celebrating the extraordinary accomplishments of three outstanding Albemarle High School students, Kat Ravichandran, Meena Amboti, and Isabel Pardue. Kat and Meena earned top honors at this year's Piedmont Regional Science Fair when they received grand awards. And Meena was also a grand prize winner in the state science fair competition. Isabel was chosen for the top Emily Kurek Leadership Forum Scholarship this spring. All three students are with us today via Zoom, and I'm going to let each of them talk about their amazing research and contributions to science, our communities, and perhaps the world's health and well-being. Let me offer those some brief descriptions. I'm sure our accomplished guests will correct me if I'm wrong. First, CATS research examined the effectiveness of quarantines and vaccines in controlling and combating the spread of infections. While this work began before the world heard of COVID-19, its importance to communities across the globe could not be more relevant than it is right now. Mina's research tackled another health problem. Worldwide, there are about 200 million people who suffer from dry macular degeneration, an eye condition that often leads to blindness. Until now, there has not been a treatment for this terrible disease. There may soon be as a result of Mina's research. She found evidence that a drug approved by the FDA to treat clinical depression I'm lost here. Oh, also protects the retina and could be a treatment for macular degeneration. Take note, both of these students are sophomores. Another student who has been active on behalf of health issues dating back to her sophomore year is Isabel, who is now a senior. She is also a Piedmont Regional Science Fair champion in her own right for her research on student mental health issues. And more recently, she started her own company. She uses a portion of the profits from her business to support Region 10 in providing students with mental health services. For her courage in overcoming her own challenges, her academic success, and her passion for helping others, Isabel received the Emily Couric Leadership Forum's Top Award for 2020, a $50,000 scholarship. I'd like to ask each of our guests to take a minute to share some of their thoughts about their research, about what they have learned, and about their future plans. Let's start with Kat, then Mina, and then Isabel. Thank you all for making our meeting this evening so special. So first, Kat.<|eot_id|>\n",

      "meenakshiambati: So I've been researching a disease called macular degeneration. And this is a blinding condition that affects over 200 million people around the world. The vast majority of the cases, about 90%, are what's called the dry type of macular degeneration. And there is no FDA-approved treatment for this form of the disease, which often leads to irreversible blindness in people over the age of 50. They lose the ability to read, watch TV, and sometimes even see faces. This horrible disease strips patients of their most important sense, robbing them of their humanity. Dry macular degeneration causes blindness by killing cells in the center of the retina, known as the macula, effectively punching holes in patients' vision. As this disease has no treatment, I wanted to find the first therapy. Traditional drug development costs billions of dollars and over a decade of research and testing. Instead, I focused on finding a drug that's already FDA approved for another disease and testing whether it could be repurposed for this one. I discovered that fluoxetine, also known as Prozac, which is used to treat depression, could be repurposed as potentially the first treatment for dry macular degeneration. My novel repurposing method dramatically decreases the time and cost of creating a treatment. In my experiments, I tested fluoxetine in cells, retinal tissue, and a health insurance database covering 25 million patients. I found that fluoxetine was able to protect retinal cells and animal models from retinal degeneration. In addition, I performed a retrospective study in a large health insurance database and found that patients taking fluoxetine had a much lower risk of developing macular degeneration. I'm excited that my work can be translated from the lab to the patients quickly, saving millions. I'm also really excited about continuing to work on this project, and I'm aiming to launch prospective randomized clinical trials as soon as possible so that we can develop the very first treatment for this blinding disease. Thank you. Extraordinary.<|eot_id|>\n",

      "katharinaravichan: Yeah, I've currently been exploring it. But there's a few things that I haven't been able to fully understand because the fear is that if they introduce a vaccine, we don't know exactly how effective that vaccine is going to be. And so the numbers vary depending on how effective this initial vaccine being released is going to be.\n",
      "unknownspeaker: OK. Wow.\n",
      "katharinaravichan: Yeah. Thank you. That was a good question. And what you said, it was 93% risk, I mean, rate for measles herd immunity, right? Yes. We'd expect probably a similar number for COVID. The biggest varying factors are going to be population density, because the measles number is primarily in the United States. So the COVID number might vary in places that have higher population density and lower population density, and also spread rate, because measles is an extremely highly infected disease. And COVID is also infectious, but it's just how those two will relate. But I would expect to see something else in the 90th percentile.\n",

One is we have opened our summer school registration for our high school students, just to let you know that that will continue as we have in the past. Our high schools are, those courses are virtual, so we have no real changes there. The first day of registration, we had more students than we've ever had before on our first day. At this point, we have 360 students registered. That registration is open until June 5th. Typically, we have about 400 students that come to summer high school, summer school. Most of the students that have registered so far are in PE and health, which is typically our trend. And we have about 35 students registered for econ and personal finance. So just wanted to let you know, if you hear about summer school for high school, that's, we're continuing in the fashion we've been doing for the last several years. The second item I have is just to let you know that the Return to School Task Force has convened and met twice this week. We are each, there's four areas of focus. We're looking at healthy students, healthy environments, healthy staff, and healthy instruction. There is a key central office person and a principal that are leading each of those smaller work groups. And at this point, it looks like about 12 educators on each of the work panels. So it looks at this point, we probably have over 60 educators, now Markham Public Schools, working on this document that we will have finished by June 1st. And then we'll begin to vet with multiple groups, health advisory, teacher advisory, et cetera. And then we'll be bringing that to you at your June 11th meeting.

      "unknownspeaker: Yes, indeed. I echo that.\n",
      "katrinacallsen: I also am incredibly thankful for the work that Maya has done and all the staff has done to rework the budget. I did have a question, and perhaps this would be more appropriate later, but I just wanted to throw it out there. And I should have probably asked it last week. When we are revamping the budget, have we ever considered doing like a zero-based budgeting model for departments since we're kind of in a time of constriction with our budget? And I know Steve had mentioned that maybe 10 or 15 years ago, we went through and did that with departments. I was just wondering if that's something that had been kicked around as we do next year's budget, because as you mentioned, Jono, they're probably already starting on next year's cycle.\n",
      "mayakumazawa: We actually did that for the Department of Transportation for the FY21 budget. And that's why we're showing a little bit of an increase to that. Because that was one that, you know, needed to be completely revamped. And it was a pretty good exercise. So I can imagine that maybe not all at once, but we can tackle departments, a few departments a year and do that, what we do with transportation for this process.\n",
      "unknownspeaker: Yeah, that's just kind of my thought is if we have kind of like, you know, it's best practice to have an accountant to do accounting. What's the word I'm thinking of, Kate? What's the committee that we're on? Audit. Thank you. It started with an A. I was close. Thank you, Matt. It's a good policy to do an audit every few years. I was just wondering if we had kind of a policy where we do take departments by department so that we know that every, I don't know, decade or so, we are really accounting from the bottom up. And it's a good way to find, not cost savings, but to make sure that we're efficient and that we're keeping our priorities on what's important today versus, you know, a decade ago. So that's what I was curious about.<|eot_id|>\n",

      "unknownspeaker: So then maybe then, so if there's no objection from the board, I propose that we move forward with the plan for a half-day board retreat on June 5th, and we can kind of shift the discussion now to what may be the topics that we want to have on there. So the ones that we have put in front of you already are the evaluations, both the board self-evaluation and the superintendent evaluation, the recovery of learning phase and the logistics and planning behind the new strategic plan that's going to come up. But again, the board really should play a significant role in determining the agenda for this retreat. And so I guess I would open it, I'd like to open it back up to the board for thoughts on that. Are these the right agenda items right now? Are there other things that you would like to get on there? And if we're going for a half day part one, what would you like to see in part one?

So we feel like they're going to be a few things that we can do that will help certainly to go for more. But I think we're all excited that as we move into the next budget year. Tomorrow is Mister over said hopefully the following year will be able to go back in and move forward with that expansion to all school really is a program that that has a tremendous impact on students and I always like to mention to folks that the surveys that we've done in addition to just the overall reduction of the number of suspensions in the school was really important to remember about what happens with that program is that not only do students not out of school, we see significant numbers of students step and leave out of that program in a better position academically, then they walk in because they have the opportunity to, you know, to do some catch up work in a really important piece for us going forward.\n",

Specifically, the School Board will establish its members' salaries by affirmative vote between May 1st and June 30th annually. If the salary increase is approved by an affirmative vote, then the increase will take effect on July 1st. Currently, Albemarle County School Board members receive an annual salary of $6,907. The current chair stipend is an additional $1,800 annually, and the vice chair receives a stipend of $35 per meeting chair. The Board of Supervisors also pays its chair a stipend of $1,800 annually, and the vice chair a stipend of $35 per meeting shared. Typically, the school board increases its salary by the same increase provided to classified staff. If the board follows the same increases classified, then the salary beginning July first 2020 would remain at $6,097. Before discussion, may I please have a motion to direct the board clerk to advertise for public hearing a school board member's salary of $6,907 with a chair stipend of $1,800 and a vice chair stipend of $35 per meeting shared.

I'm Claire Kaiser, assistant superintendent. As Ms. Collins shared, we have had some ongoing challenges with staffing due to the COVID surge, but we're able to continue our work in these times due to a group of dedicated employees who are willing to step in, often at the last minute, to cover classes as substitutes. We are grateful to be able to make some adjustments to their pay for all types of the substitutes that we have. This includes our daily subs who come in each day, often in a different position every day to cover classes. Our long-term subs, we have retirees who have come in and substituted as well. And we also have teachers and staff members who cover classes in addition to their regular daily work. As a reminder, the increased rate for retirees and the paper staff who do that class coverage for part of a substituted initiative as part of a recent budget. The daily separate is going to be first adjusted and it will keep us competitive with our local school divisions. And then the other rates will be adjusted accordingly. We anticipate that this change will go into effect by early February. We do want to very much thank those people, our subs, our teachers, and other school staff members who have provided coverage during these very challenging times.

It's difficult for me to divorce our conversation of this afternoon about teacher salaries from looking at what happens on July for the next school year, our upcoming budget. We have precedent with the school division of having salary increases that start before July one. So one thing, and given that we have a significant fund balance, it is possible perhaps for us to consider A teacher salary increase starting in April or March, March might be a pretty quick turnaround, but having a three percent, for example, pay raise for teachers and then not that would. Go to the next school year, that would be one way to help them catch up. Likewise, we could. Vote on the 15 dollar or the minimum wage proposal to take effect prior to, you know, an earlier date in another couple of months, that would not make up for all the. For not having a pay raise this year, but it would start to pay raise a little bit earlier.<|eot_id|>\n",

She's already connected with Katina, and Katina's already connected with the arts director for the schools. And her ideas are looking at art K through 12 across all different kinds of art.

Profit Road, I guess, but the. The. The size of Mountain View and the sort of the impetus, I would guess, for some of the discussion about school sizes has to do with Mountain View and maybe scouting for another site for a school property in that Western feeder pattern. I don't know, did you all get to, I mean, an aerial view of pinpointing where that could be? I'm concerned about, well, Well, I don't even have a question, really. It's just that that is certainly something that we need to look at. But that is fundamentally going to be based on what we think about the size. And with Mountain View in particular, it's not just what is the ideal size for an elementary school. It's this piece of property can't hold any more kids, basically. So we're going to have to do something. So I guess that was a ramble. But if anybody wants to respond to it, feel free.<|eot_id|>\n",

Because the current plan really gets us from a capacity perspective up until say the 2023, 2024 school year. But you just drive down Avon Street and you can see the high density residential units going up. And, you know, getting beyond 2024, you got 780 kids, potentially, in that school and and you bring up a really good point about, you know, can we scale, you know, we're not Fairfax County with You know, the massive school system that they, you know, we have to think hard about whether our strategy, you know, is aligned in the educational experience we want to give our kids can really be delivered in an elementary school of that size or larger because you lose some things at scale.

And I feel like this is something which can really be helpful to each one of us in trying to help foster better discussion environments around us. So my program came to the conclusion that what we really need to do to decrease political polarization and therefore increase the quality of our political dialogue is to separate our social relationships from our political beliefs. Basically, we shouldn't choose our friends. We shouldn't hold it against people that they might disagree with us, which I think is a really important lesson in the wider world. Additionally, I investigated a wide number of interesting phenomena and how they relate to political polarization, such as people's skepticism of different views, moderation of the entire society, and several other more complex parameters.

It was all done virtually, so it was definitely a big change because Sam and I have both competed in fairs before, but not the international fair, so just switching over to the virtual format to presenting was definitely a change. But the interviews, they were all really great. Before we talked to the judges, they looked through all our project materials, So they sort of had an idea of what questions to go into it.

Well, it was actually kind of funny. So when we received, I first received a call from the regional fair. And while he was speaking to me, he realized that the other grand award winner had the same last name and asked me if maybe she was near enough to the phone. So he was able to tell both of us at the same time about our success. And I think our projects are in completely different categories. So we're not so much competitors as you might think.

      "unknownspeaker: Hi, my name is Emily Mason. I'm in the Rio district. I have a third grader and a seventh grader. And I wanted to speak tonight to continue to push for anti racism in our division. I know the school board is limited and that you are not responsible for making specific hiring decisions or for curriculum design. But I do think you can continue to push for your stated commitment to anti racism. And as we look to next school year, I urge you not to return to the status quo. I'd like to ask you to learn from this year and be really intentional about next year. And I think there are a few areas in particular that I'd like to ask you some questions about. So one question is whose priorities and needs are being centered? And one is around curriculum. So in all subjects, but in social studies and in history in particular, just continuing to tell the truth about history. I know many states and many districts, there's been some pushback to telling the truth about history. And I just urge you to continue to hold your commitment to anti-racism as you have stated before. I'm wondering about with the gifted identification, what measures are being used? I know that this has been in flux, and I wonder who is being excluded from these services. I wonder about the SOL tests, and when we didn't have the tests last year, how did that work out, in particular for students of color? Who do the tests benefit? Related to hiring decisions, I know that this has been an area of focus, I'm wondering, who are you bringing into the school division and what leaders and educators can students benefit from learning from different perspectives and wisdom that all students can benefit from? With regards to books, classroom study, and in the library, whose stories are being told? With regards to the school resource officers, I know that they have been removed from the school. The MOU has been eliminated and I really appreciate that. And I am still very wary of these newly created positions of the safety coaches. And I would like to continue to push on who's safety is being prioritized and just to really keep a lens of anti-racism in the hiring decisions and the unrolling of this program. Regarding ongoing professional development, I know that the county has been moving in the right direction with culturally responsive teaching. And I just wanna make sure that this isn't a flashy project, that this is something that continues to have sustained and ongoing effort and attention. I wonder about the overall school environment. And I just wonder, aside from COVID, are there other reasons that families of color have felt safer keeping their children at home? And so when we open up next year, what are we going to do to create a safe school environment for all children? So in closing, COVID-19 is an invisible disease that we work together as a community, not only to mitigate, but are working to eradicate. So what if we work with this same energy, commitment, and effort to fight the invisible disease of racism?<|eot_id|>\n",

And I'm here tonight along with Eileen Gomez, one of our wonderful school nurses who we just honored just a few minutes ago to give you our COVID-19 update for May 13th. As you recall, one of the things that we report out to the board at every board meeting is the level of community transmission of COVID in Albemarle and the surrounding area. And I'll turn things over to Eileen to give you the latest updates.\n",
      "eileengomez: Thank you Dr. McLaughlin and thank you Ms. Lee and the school board for that proclamation honoring the school nurses. I'm very proud to be serving with this admirable group of professionals. I'm very pleased to share with you the numbers this week. As you can see on this slide that the case counts have been falling As of today, Albemarle County's seven-day floating or moving average of number of new cases per 100,000 people is 2.1. Case counts have been decreasing for the past 24 days, which exceeds the threshold of 14 days. So this is considered a decreasing trend. I believe this is the lowest number that we've had this school year and since I've been looking at the data. The seven day floating or moving average for the percent of COVID cases tests that were positive is under 1%, 0.9%. This indicator has been decreasing for 24 consecutive days. So this is also considered a decreasing trend. The numbers for Charlottesville have also been very good. The seven day moving average of number of cases per 100,000 residents as of today is 1.9. This indicator has been decreasing for the past 38 days, which exceeds the threshold and is considered a decreasing trend. The percent positivity of Charlottesville has also dropped. You can see that as of today, that's 0.5%. And this has been decreasing for the past 42 days, that's also considered a decreasing trend. The numbers of cases at UVA remains low. Over the last two weeks, they reported a total of nine cases, six in students and three in staff. So we're very pleased with this progress. I'm also just going to update you a little bit about the youth vaccination rates. As of Yesterday, the Pfizer vaccine was only on license for children ages 16 and above. But as of last night, they issued the approval for use in youth ages 12 to 15. But they have not yet reported on the data of those kids receiving their vaccines as of today. But for the other age group, 16 to 19, with a little bit of math and estimations, I can tell you that The vaccination rate for 16 to 19 year olds in this community is about 50% for these people who have received one dose. And to be considered fully vaccinated, we are at about 31% of this age group. So that's all very good news. Dr. McLaughlin?<|eot_id|>\n",

And as you recall, we we also share this graph with you every week around the CDC core indicators to to put a metric around our community transmission level. I'm also very pleased to say that we have been we've moved into the moderate level of of community transmission. That's primarily because Our core indicator for case incidents has fallen below the 50 cumulative cases per week. total into the moderate level. I believe to get to the low level, you need fewer than 10 cumulative cases over a seven-day period. And if you recall, we do see this one spike here. You may remember that a couple of weeks ago, we had an anomaly with the numbers where 65 additional cases were added in to the Albemarle numbers from testing that had been done over the course of several weeks. So that's good news. really all around. When we look at our level of school impact, we still feel that our impact in the schools is very low. We have very sporadic cases with no evidence of transmission, no impact on student absenteeism other than normal absenteeism, and staff capacity is at normal levels. And when you put those two together, for the first time, I think, since we've been reporting on these metrics, we've actually moved to the lowest level of impact on the CDC chart when you put our moderate level of community transmission and our low level of school impact. So, you know, it hasn't been often we could come with really good news to the board, but I think the trends certainly are, have been in our favor over the past couple of weeks. and we'd be happy to take any questions from the board.\n",

I mean, we Well, if that was all I have to say, do we need to revisit that? I mean, our schools are getting bigger. Brownsville has been almost the size of Monticello High School for some time. That will be alleviated once we build Crozet. But then our largest school will be Mountain View. And it's pushing 800. That's a very large elementary school.

      "grahampaige: Our next item is our school board salary advertisement. And to sort of update all of our board members, an elected school board, such as here in Albemarle County, may pay each of its members an annual salary that is consistent with the salary of procedures and no more than the salary limits provided for by local government bodies. The school board has adopted the procedure currently used by the Board of Supervisors in setting its member salary pursuant to Virginia Code section 15.2, 1414-3. Specifically, the school board will establish the member's salary by affirmative vote annually between May 1st and June 20th, or 30th rather. Before setting a salary each year, the board is required to hold a public hearing and provide notice as specified by Virginia Code Section 15-2, 1426 and 1427. If the salary increase is approved by an affirmative vote, then the increase will take effect on July 1st. Currently our school board members receive an annual salary of $6,907. The current chairman's stipend is an additional $1,800 annually, and the vice chairman receives a stipend of $35 per meeting chair. Typically, the school board increases its salary by the same increase provided to classified staff. If the board follows the same increase as classified, then the salary beginning July 1st, 2021 would be $7,183. So what we need to do in a motion tonight would be to direct the board clerk to advertise for public hearing a school board member salary of $7,183 with a chairman stipend of 1,800 and a vice chairman stipend of $35 per meeting chair. We need a motion to that effect.<|eot_id|>\n",

So the current system that people are scheduled in and what our our system is scheduling clinics for will be going out by March 1st and we'll be implementing a new one. So the process for that is a little bit different. So rather than opening up a one day clinic to all of the individuals who are registered, we'll be sending direct links to individuals based on the prioritization categories set by BDH. So it provides a little more direct access for those that are currently eligible. One of the issues we had faced early on was that when we opened up those sites, anyone in 1B, whether it was 1B1 or 1B9, could have had access if they had an account in the system. So this allows us to provide access to those within those priority groups. a little more easily than the previous system.

And most of the research that I have seen has suggested that that won't even be possible without more time in the seat, whether it's longer days or longer school year or some sort of enrichment. And this calendar looks pretty much like the last several calendars I have seen. So are we contemplating anything like that or have any flexibility in modifying the calendar?

And they may come forward with recommendations to make some alterations to this. So much like the last calendars we've had, we've had to kind of adjust them on the fly. And so if that group makes some recommendations, we would bring those back to the board if they say, hey, best practices to make some alterations to this. One thing that is really on the front burner with that group is what this summer might look like. And we've got in development right now some really robust summer activities and offerings for our students that are being developed. And most likely those will be developed at no cost through the CARES Act funding that is available to them. So I would expect that the board's gonna hear some additional information on those in the not too distant future.\n",
      "jonnoalcaro: Dr. McGuffin, just one minor point on this is I noticed on November 2nd, which is election day, it's the only day that it shows set aside for parent-teacher conferences. And I'm just wondering, will there be on the calendar this year, other days that are set aside, not the whole day, but that parent-teacher conferences will be on those days? Or is that really more fluid for and those decisions made by individual schools.\n",
      "patrickmclau: So what we what we generally do for parent teacher conferences is we hold one day for those conferences to take place. but then we give schools and teachers the options to hold those at a different time. So we see that if you look, say, at our middle schools and high schools, they will typically have two evenings where parents are invited in for parent-teacher conferences. When that happens, we use the day that's designated for parent conferences as a flex day for those teachers to pay them back for the time that they committed on those evenings. Some teachers choose to, particularly at the elementary school level, have the option to choose that day to have parents come in to meet with them, or elementary teachers can set conferences throughout, you know, over the course of a couple of weeks at times that are convenient to them and to parents, and then take that as a flex day as well. So that's kind of there in case it's needed, but oftentimes there are multiple opportunities for parents to come in and meet with teachers. Is the use of election day is that at all kind of a conflict in terms of having other other people in some of our buildings voting versus some parents coming in and out that day for conferences. We have it is falling on that day for for the past several years, so I haven't heard that as a concern, but we can certainly look at we've got a we can certainly take a look and see if that's going to be an issue for folks.<|eot_id|>\n",

      "unknownspeaker: So typically, we use a portion of our fund balance because we do We always almost always generate a fund balance at the end of every fiscal year we're not able to expend more than we have budgeted. Even if we receive additional monies whatever's appropriated is the maximum that we are permitted by code to spend. So we do anticipate generating a fund balance at the end of almost every fiscal year. And we're using that fund balance as a budget balancing tool almost every year as a recurring revenue stream. OK. OK. Now I understand. Thank you. Yes, ma'am. And for the current year, we do anticipate bringing forward some more uses of current year fund balance, a particular EDP is not going to be receiving sufficient revenues. to offset its expenses for the current year. So that's just an example of some of the things that we'll be bringing forward for use of current year fund balance in future meetings. OK. Any other questions for Mr. Zimmerman? We do exactly what request do we have to vote on, Mr. Zimmerman, from your report? I would appreciate just receiving a yay or a nay regarding the bringing forward an item regarding one-time payments for staff in a future board meeting for consent.\n",

And if I might, Mr. Zimmerman, in your notes to us in the first paragraph under expenses, on the last sentence, you say a number of special revenue programs may need substantive financial assistance to maintain programs in the face of reduced revenue opportunities due to COVID closure. And in looking on pages nine, and it goes over into page 10 of your report, we end up with about a negative, about $1.161 million. And I just was curious as to what your recommendation or strategy was for changes within the current year budget to accomplish what you said there?\n",
      "so: So a number of our special revenue funds are federal funds that we seek reimbursement for. So we're always run in the negative for a number of those funds throughout the year until we get to year end. So the ones that we would probably be looking at as to whether or not revenues will be sufficient to support will primarily be EDP, our fee-based revenue programs. EDP, open doors, driver's ed may be a component, may or may not be a component, but we'll need to take a look at all of our fee-based services that are provided, that are part of our special revenue funds to make sure that those will be whole at the end of the year.<|eot_id|>\n",

Because if you look at if, I mean, there are a number of counties surrounding Amherst County that do not have the facilities necessary to treat somebody with COVID. And so their hospital levels remain low. And yet they come here and ours go high. If you look at, there was a period of time where we were at an elevated level, not because of the infections in our county, but because of the admissions in our county. So it made it look like our infection rate was higher than the surrounding counties, which was not true. But because of the way the CDC did it, they're assuming every county has a hospital, right? But it's impossible for a county that doesn't have a hospital, and there are a number of them in Virginia. to be impacted by that number. So it's only by the number of actual infections. And so I just don't, I hate to tie it to that simply because they could have an outbreak in Louisa and we have to keep wearing masks in school and they don't. I just, so I,\n",
      "patrickmclaughlin: Mr. Oberg, if I could provide one quick point of clarification. It relates to what you were saying. My understanding of the hospitalization rate is that the CDC looks at our health area as a whole. It comprises a number of counties, regardless of whether or not they have a hospital within that county. And they take the total number of cases that happen within that health district, hospitalizations that happen within that health district, and farm it out based on proportion of size of the county. So they do try to account for that a little bit. I don't know if it's a perfect system for that, but you can see counties without a hospital in them have an elevated level of hospitalizations as an intuitive as that seems.<|eot_id|>\n",

      "unknownspeaker: Yeah, so, and Dr. Acuff, I totally agree that looking at equity audited data at a high altitude level like this is not a new practice at all. It's something that we've been doing for a long time. What the equity specialist team has been doing is working with teachers and PLCs and smaller groups to look at smaller sets of data and perform equity audit. So what's less common, I think, in our history is for teachers to look through their own data and look for these sort of patterns and then begin to triangulate them. And so that's when it begins to take meaning when you have people looking at micro data and small data and seeing how their individual locus of control situates within the larger data. And that's important. So I think In working with principals on the on the equity audit process I think the questions that are in the in the process here. we're working to build common language and common process from administrators all the way down to PLCs and to teachers, and it's when there's conversation across there. And I think in the past, administrators will look at big data sets like this and then tell it to teachers and say, hey, what are we gonna do about it? And then teachers go back and they wonder about it, and then they engage in their classroom practice. But what we're asking teachers to do now, and again, like PLCs and smaller, groups as they go through this process and to learn how to disaggregate data in this way, and then to ask these key questions and begin to triangulate those patterns. So when we're looking at big assessment data here, do those patterns show up in engagement data? Do they show up when we look at discipline data? Do they show up when we look at, you know, smaller assessments? And then we put everybody in conversation with them. But I agree, this is not a new process at this altitude, I think. And it's hard to answer these big questions when we look at these big data sets.<|eot_id|>\n",

I mean, I don't, I'm making probably unfounded assumptions about who our English language learners are, but it seems, I mean, maybe the grab bag category captures income and race and English language learners sufficiently, but I'm struck by how high the numbers are for English language learners.<|eot_id|>\n",

In the past 15 years, it's grown significantly in other non-Hispanic languages. That's one of the things we started to discuss as an organization is how do we disaggregate ethnicity or other characteristics beyond just those very basic characteristics, right? Because when you think about Asian, that covers everything from the Middle East all the way over to the Pacific. And that's roughly 4 billion people who are not necessarily homogenous in any way, shape or form. but we give them the same one label. And so how do we start to think about minor distinctions? And that's one of the things that our new ESOL coordinator, Laura McClain, has been really encouraging me to think about in terms of data is digging a little more deeply, like going beyond just English language learner to what language do they come from and what language are they learning? what language proficiency do they have when they begin?

There's no mid-year checkpoint. Next year, schools will move to quarterly checkpoints. You have to keep the pressure on, keep the foot on the gas. Now, Kate, remember, these are raw scores. So the students, as we make our way through, they're going to get credit for growth. So a student that comes in several grade levels behind shouldn't be expected to get all caught up in one year, especially as Chris was mentioning, we get students from Afghanistan that have never set foot in the school. So they're also their WIDA scores count for their English development instead of their SOL scores. These are just raw scores. Next year, because we'll be able to equate them, we'll be able to show you, we'll be able to project growth scores too. But I see Lawrence has a comment.<|eot_id|>\n",

There's a huge diversity across our school division. And so my question is really at the board level. I know we just had a session that talked about differentiated staffing, but to sort of modify your games from cooperative to competitive learning. It's hugely time consuming within a class. So I know we reduce class sizes and we have some differentiated staffing to help address that. I'm just wondering if our approach is refined enough to deal with the students we have across the various schools. I beat this drum a lot, but. And it's not a question that can be answered tonight probably, but that's my concern. Is there a bigger challenge in a school with 60% black and Hispanic students versus one that has 10% and how does that change or does it change or does it intensify the approach? I don't know. I don't know what it should be doing, but I have concerns.<|eot_id|>\n",

And so part of our program is really building in equity audits of our work and being very real about who we are serving and really going at an assets-based approach, a continuing of that, and really defining it and making it more visible. So that's our goal there. And all of our talent development resource teachers are 100% on board and doing that work right now. As far as the English and language arts component, just very specifically, we're working in really partnering with the anti-racism policy and moving that work forward, looking at our approach to literature and letting go of literary whiteness and working through that and really examining our equitable practices in that area and empowering teachers to empower students to critically read with and through text so that they can be more empowered as citizens and as individuals.

My mom had a lot of kids, my parents didn't have a lot of money, and I remember the one class I failed in high school was one that the grading was all about whether you could construct this notebook and keep it with you the whole period and have it every day with all your papers in the right order. That's what the grade was based on, and I couldn't. I mean, it's a very real thing that affects a lot of students when your grades are not based on your content knowledge necessarily, but like the preparation or what you can bring in.

That's a big deal. But what I would ask is if, Jay, would you go back and dig up the survey results from this? We did the survey, I think. It's been a couple of years ago now, hasn't it? 2018 yeah yeah so for for some of the board members that were newer to the board they might appreciate uh seeing the results in the survey because it like you were mentioning earlier how uh how inconsistent the grading was across schools and classrooms within schools on some pretty key areas um and then we did have teachers say wow i mean we really want to be more consistent with each other and i think that was the launching pad for us to begin to to work on this. So I'm also excited about the micro-credential for grading. It is a critical practice for teachers. It's also the area of the greatest malpractice that we have in education. And none of our other reforms will move forward and have the impact they can have unless we become more accurate with assessing and reporting student performance.

Because that could be huge. whole buildings of kindergartners. As I alluded to. Yeah, but how cool would that be? It would be pretty cool. Kindergarteners are awesome. As I alluded to in the enrollment agenda item, making projections for next year is going to be challenging.

Sure, and some of what you said is absolutely correct, that the math teacher is important to KTEC because when we offer core classes, it really allows students to have some flexibility in their schedule. When they give up a half day to be a KTEC, it's hard to be here for a half day and not get a core class in. But that's a logistical reason that we wanted An instructional reason that we really wanted is because we feel like KTEC offers an opportunity for our students to really understand the relevance of math. I always use the same example, but I'll use this one. When you're building a house, you're using a lot of geometry. And we feel like our students that maybe haven't always understood the real life application of math will have the opportunity by taking math here embedded into building trades and electricity will really be able to see math in action and be able to understand why math is important and how they use it in their real life.<|eot_id|>\n",

I mean, I think that that would surprise many people in our community that we are so far off the national median even. But anyway, that's it.<|eot_id|>\n",

So it it might be easier than NAEP is basically what that's saying. That's not good. And then in terms of the pre-K It certainly is helpful. It definitely improves kindergarten readiness. But if you look at the just the impact on reading assuming that kids are coming into a kindergarten classroom where they're getting you know quality Tier 1 instruction on this. It's the kids who are in pre-K don't continue to outperform. That's all that says. It doesn't say it doesn't mean that they they lose ground by any means. It just means it certainly sets them up well. And in fact, you know, pre-K is is really helpful helpful for a host of other preparedness and readiness indicator, but in terms of reading, it doesn't help them then continue to outperform beyond kindergarten. So it's a piece of the puzzle, right, but it is not the answer. Thank you. Sarah, if I could ask one question along the lines of what you just said about preparedness and readiness. How do teachers need to be trained in order to work along the lines of what you have been telling us about? Because intellectually, what you're saying makes a lot of sense and a great deal of sense. And I have to wonder what would have to be changed in the way that teachers are trained to teach reading and how big a project is that for the short term and the long term? That is a great question. So As I mentioned this is part of a much much larger body of research and this kind of second part of this presentation is always about the exactly we said so so now what. How do we do this. And part of that focuses intentionally and explicitly on training and making sure that all teachers not just you know literacy specialists all teachers in you know your K through 3rd grades are trained in the science of reading. There are a number of different ways to do that these days. There are some grow your own programs or also kind of vendor programs you can you know have someone come to your district. But I also want to point out that we also think it's really, really important that principals get trained in this as well. And that's because we need principals to be literacy kind of champions, we call them, for the buildings. Not only to kind of, you know, sort of signal that this really is sort of how your institution does this, but also to serve as a resource. for and a support system for your teachers especially as they're doing you know classroom walkthroughs or observations to really make sure that they are a team as they approach literacy efforts. So yes we would recommend teachers get this very you know clearly trained not just in sort of a one-off PD experience but we would also recommend that principals do so as well.<|eot_id|>\n",

So it's that parent family partnership of being able to teach it. And it's something that you could easily do a screencast and then share that out to families of this is what you should be looking for.

Our teams are continuing to scrub numbers and fold in the latest information available. We work closely with local government, particularly on compensation and benefits. Yesterday, Mr. Jeff Richardson, county executive, presented his recommended budget to the Board of Supervisors. So tonight you will see some technical adjustments, which will slightly increase some items from the draft funding request. But most notably, you will see some significant savings based on recent analysis. So the first half of the work session will focus on new expenditures and compensation. And then the second half will be a broader discussion on expenditures. We've taken your feedback from the last work session, incorporated more orientation to the budget book, including page numbers so that you can follow along.

And so comparing us with a largely rural community like Nelson County, I think only brings down the average.

We tried to really look at the marketplace variations on the marketplace a couple of years ago. when we ended up going to the straight line and opted to stay with the same ones that we had. One of the things that is a little different between us and our brothers and sisters over in Charlottesville is that their budget this year is paying about $21,000 per student, moving for school year 21-22. where ours is coming in at about 14,950-ish. And so there is a disparity in there and a gap that leads not just to the salaries, but to other issues. And with us having a rural aspect to it, that has to have a factor in there. And I think their city council is not timid when it comes to raising taxes in order to pay for things both in the city and in the schools. That's not a criticism of the Board of Supervisors.

Thanks, Dr. Haas good evening board members, Pat McLaughlin chief of strategic planning and I have got some news today that we wanted to share you that's actually very timely, as I know the board is in the process right now of selecting new student representatives for the board. I was out at Western Albemarle for a meeting and happened to run into Elijah wit, who you all know was a previous former member of the school board as a student representative, and he said well you've got to let the board know that I just found out this week that I am going to become a Jefferson scholar at the University of Virginia, and he said it really I see Miss sublet they are very happy to say that and but what he really was focused on was the opportunity that this board gave him because he said throughout the process of Jefferson scholars a rigorous process to to go through for sure that he continually came back to his experience as a student rep on the board. and thinks that really made a significant impact on the committee. So he wanted to, number one, let you know of his celebration, but also express his great thanks to the board for that opportunity and a great promotion for the student rep program. So I thought we'd bring some good news to you tonight on that front.\n",

Thank you, Dr. Haas, for your announcements. And that future principal, I mean, future superintendent one is something for us to be aware of, right? And also thanks to our principals who are with us tonight, Ms. Wood, Ms. Costa, and Ms. Sublett.

So the school board invites and actively seeks the public's input in the matters relevant to school board governance and provides for time during its business meetings to hear from Alma County residents and community members. As authorized by ordinance of the County of Albemarle, the school board will hold its meetings electronically during the pandemic. The school board is nevertheless committed to encouraging public comment despite its need to meet on a virtual basis. For this reason, there will be two ways for the public to provide comment. First, as always, written comments may be submitted to the school board clerk or to the school board as a whole via email prior to the start of the meeting and will be given to all school board members for review. Second, as long as the school board holds its meetings electronically, members of the public wishing to speak during the meeting may sign up online by 2 p.m. the day of the meeting. Before public comment starts, I'm going to announce the order. There's only three, so I'll announce all of them. Each speaker will have three minutes to speak. I will try to notify you when you reach a two-minute mark. I hold up a finger. It's easy to miss, and so please try to time yourself if you can. Speakers during the meeting or those submitting written comments should state their name and address our magisterial district. Further, speakers should limit comments to those matters that are relevant to school board governance or the operations of the school division. Although the school board will not respond to comments made during the public comment period, school board members may address comments at the end of the meeting agenda under other business. And with that, I will go ahead and announce our speakers. We have Sarah Harris, who I see in here, James McClung, I believe is in here, and Beth Sarosiak. So, Ms. Harris, if you are Ready? You can go. Hi, can you hear me?<|eot_id|>\n",

I'm Maya Kumagawa, Director of Budget and Planning, and I just wanted to quickly jump in and mention the process of how we might address the funding needed above what's currently allocated. Both the additional funding needed for basements and the additional funding needed for alternates will be included as part of the FY23 budget development process. In April, we plan on coming back to you with updates that include final state revenue projections and projected available one-time funds, which we will plan to build into next year's budget. At that time, we can discuss an adjustment in the one-time transfer to the CIP as we prioritize our various capital needs known at that time.\n",

So we will. The newer system, I think, is a little bit more efficient, but you do actually have an efficiency over when the building was originally built.

I was just gonna I was kind of wondering about the process I guess i'm getting a little nervous because we're so much over what was the estimated cost, I guess, I would like a little bit more information about why. why that is, is this something we should expect when we have future? I mean, because we started at 5 million something and now it's up to eight just to get the base with another 1.4 to get the, you know, is it, I'm sure things change as we went and COVID things, but I guess I'd like to hear why we were so off in our original estimate.\n",
      "jackclark: Good point. Good question. Two areas here. One is we are proposing more square footage than the original budget had. We found as we did, investigations, discussions, meetings out at Mountain View, there were more needs than just general classrooms. The educational programs that they have out there for their students, they do need more spaces, more flexible spaces and smaller spaces. So we're trying to provide those. So there is more square footage. It's a bigger addition for the classroom area. It's also a bigger addition for the cafeteria. It isn't just a cafeteria expansion. It's also a new entrance. And it also includes some, individual restrooms. The second part of this is that there are significant changes in the construction bid market these days. Prices have gone very much higher than they were several years ago when this project was first planned. A lot of it is to do with material availability issues, supply chain type issues. Also, even the labor market or construction labor is tighter than it was. So those are the two issues. It's scope, size of the additions, and then the cost of construction.<|eot_id|>\n",

The board of supervisors recently discussed their plan for in person meetings. And so I want to first start with some excerpts from that from that meeting for context. The Board of Supervisors are utilizing a tiered approach for public meetings. In Tier 1, which begins April 4th, members will meet in person and attendees will be in a hybrid fashion.

But no, I'm with Katrina, I guess in my early, couple early before coven made many attempts to do community meetings and you would have a community meeting on budget and one person would show up wanting to talk about the open burning rules which.

And I like the approach of this, you know, in terms of, because I really do want to understand who is going to be coordinating it and, and bringing people in because, as has been said before, getting people to come in. They've got to be topics that we want to talk about, sure, but that people want to hear about is even more important. And then I would love to get some clarification, and this is just self-centered, because what we were trying to do before was to have The local school board member be there and the at large so that people were seeing you know both of their. representatives. And so I'd love to know what the thought is. Will I be doing, in your thought process, will I be doing six different meetings? And so then there would be six other meetings being done by the local board representative. And I mean, these are not things that have to be answered right now, but I would love to be able to sit down with or speak by phone or Zoom with either of you to kind of talk this through, because I love the concept. I mean, I love what this is intended to do. And I've just got a whole bunch of questions.<|eot_id|>\n",

      "rachelfield: Oh, well, I might share my screen again to make it a little bit more clear. Okay. So, This right here, this is, in essence, the theorized pathway that I came up with. And in a virtual setting, it's very difficult to perform conventional research, so you have to be creative in how you collect your data. So I relied on experiments that were published in other literature and also on a very wide variety of biomedical research databases, including protein expression databases, gene expression, protein-protein interaction maps, and a bunch of other ones. So looking at those databases and collecting data from those and from published experiments, I looked for data that supported isolated interactions of two pieces in the entire pathway. So I looked for data that supported interaction between protein A and protein B, between protein A and that specific transcription activation binding site that you can see here labeled 583. I looked for data that supported an interaction between protein A and the activation of protein C. And once I had evidence from experiments and literature and these online databases of each of the isolated parts of that pathway, I put it all together into one big cohesive pathway. So the challenge now is to see if those connections actually do exist or if it's just a very strong coincidence.\n",
      "unknownspeaker: Wow, that's amazing. Thank you. Of course. Are there other questions for Rachel? Rachel, I know you answered Mr. Oberg's question, but have you decided whether you're going into the medical field or what?\n",
      "rachelfield: Yeah, yeah, wherever I go to school, I will be majoring in biology, or if they offer a more specific major in molecular and cellular biology, I will be majoring in that. And my ultimate career goal is to work in biomedical research and run a lab. I'm not exactly sure in which field yet, perhaps it'll be in neurobiology, perhaps in more general gene expression, or a field of biology that I haven't discovered yet. But the dream for me is to run a lab at a university, and also teach a couple of classes on the side, because education is very important to me as well.<|eot_id|>\n",

And as Dr. Harrison suggests, We are really looking for more opportunities to spread the anti-racism messages to our peers and to give everyone a seat at the table. I guess I'll go into a little bit on how we got involved in this project. I believe Dr. King came in once and he needed a way to spread this anonymous reporting app because it's there, but not many of the students are aware of it. And especially right now, when students are not necessarily in school. So we came up with this short video. We didn't want it to be too cheesy, but also a little something that will stick in their heads. And hopefully this does that. And like Nyquil says, allow students not to take racism from anybody.

And I also would want to raise the issue we were hearing in public comment a lot, but I'm hoping that we can discuss soon about what our plans are in the fall. I think one of the reasons I'm so nervous about taking away instructional time is we have lost so much instructional time to begin with, and next year is unknown at this point. So I just want to hold tightly the instructional time that we have, and I'm looking forward to information hopefully soon about what we're anticipating for the fall.\n",

And I think if we could also receive some information about the actual instructional time that would be provided by this method as compared to like a normal date, could all of those things be included, Dr. Haas and Dr. McLaughlin in a report next week or at our next meeting, not next week, but at our next meeting, provided that we have voted a will vote on the opening date.<|eot_id|>\n",

I was at a panel a couple of weeks ago of 100 Black women of Black voices from students and educators. And one thing that was brought up was the student representative program for the boards. And the application, this was a point that was made by a student that the application has is long and has as part of it, AP and honors classes. And I, you know, the student was making the point that that might be a barrier to some students and I recall, I think I recall that when initially we were talking about having a student representative we talked about trying to get students from all, you know, all different kinds of students.

So just so you know, with the Air and Space Museum, the Udvar-Hazy Center, so the Air and Space Museum has two locations. The Udvar-Hazy Center, which is over by Dulles, and that is the big airplane hangar where they have space shuttle and planes and the Blackbird, like all the big stuff. And then they have the one on the National Mall, which is the one that most people think about. And that's typically holds some of the smaller historic pieces of air and space history. But Udvar-Hazy has been open for the past couple months and the one on the National Mall is opening up the end of July. So very soon we shall be going there.

As you'll recall, it was just over a year ago that we introduced you to our planning partners at Battelle for Kids, and it's great to see that this project is finally coming to a conclusion. So at the retreat tomorrow, Mike Nicholson and Shannon King from Battelle will take you through a discussion of each major section of the plan to hear your affirmations, your concerns, questions, and suggestions. And we hope to use your feedback to bring you a final plan for adoption at our next business meeting on July 8th.

And the reason is that racism in our schools does directly interfere with our academic mission. And that unless we are serious about it beyond, you know, training ourselves or educating our teachers, I think we have to have a forum for our students to talk about these issues. They are, it's called courageous conversations because it's not easy. But I think, you know, I would like to know more from Dr. Haas and maybe Ms. Costa at Henley about how the pilot has gone and have more student feedback. But I think that that is probably part of the plan. But I would look forward to hearing a bit more about a bigger picture of.

And I think given the amount of comment that we've had from the public, it behooves us to try to find out more about it. And so Matt, I can reach out to you personally, but I would love to find out more information just because I don't really know. I'll own that I don't know a lot about the program. being on the board for a few years I know sometimes things can be presented in a way that's like it's different people have different interpretations of things so because we've gotten so much comment it's a little hard to like weed out what's fact and what's not. Are you so like some things were said that were concerning and i'm like well, I hope that's not what happened like I hope we didn't tell a parent on Friday that their kid was going to be in an opt in program. on Monday or she said Thursday, and then, you know, like, you know, I would like to find out, obviously, if that's happening, that's not ideal.

I mean, it was a fair, it is a fair criticism, but it's also needs to be placed in the context of we're in a pandemic. We're at the end of the school year. And we have placed a lot on our teachers and our administrators over the past year. I think that we need to respect the public's right and especially the parents' right to see the curriculum, but I would also ask that the public grant a certain amount of grace to our administrators and our teachers to recognize that the pandemic has been a huge challenge and that there are obstacles to better communication that exist currently that in a normal environment would not exist.<|eot_id|>\n",

      "matthewhaas: I'll be happy to, Mr. Page, thank you. Recognizing that we have what we term workforce instability at this point, many unfilled positions in the school system, the extra time, effort, and going above and beyond the call of duty for our classroom teachers, as well as our support staff. We were looking at providing extra time in the spring for our teachers, for our classified staff, for our teachers to have time to get some work done that they need to catch up on, to grade assessments, to make plans for the next day, be able to complete that during work time because a great deal of their planning time is being taken up right now covering for other teachers when they need to be out and just helping students recover at a greater rate than they may normally do. And with our classified staff we've identified a need for them to have professional development in areas where they're supporting teachers or, in the case of our nurses, to catch up on mitigation work that they're doing. So we felt that it would be a good idea to provide those work days. We also felt it would be good to remove some of the half days that we had put in place earlier in the year because We recognize that our attendance on those days is an anomaly when compared to other days of the school week that are full days. So by combining those PLC days with some work time and moving them to Fridays, it would be more convenient for our families to be able to deal with that. And I'd say the last part is that we really wanted to provide some work-related relief for our employees, but to not do it now, to not do it right now and give parents short notice. So we decided to go ahead and make those plans for the second semester so that all of our families would have plenty of notice about the changes. Those were our thoughts.<|eot_id|>\n",

And because we added two school days to the beginning of the calendar to make up for the half days, which are still school days that we were having later, right now, with the changes that we're making, it's really just a net reduction, I think, of three school days all together for students and families. So I think we're still well within the hour requirements. If we run into inclement weather where we start to track of long periods of time where we're out of school, then what we said in the initial work that we put before the board was that we would begin, like if we had too many inclement weather days and we felt we needed to have some more school days, we'd begin by removing the May 20th workday and then work our way back so that we can make up for that time.<|eot_id|>\n",

And we have a proposal to establish the committee, which we will, unless there's an objection, call ACES, the Advisory Committee on Environmental Sustainability. And that committee would be modeled substantially like our long-range planning committee is modeled. The mission will be largely to look at the very key areas where we can make an environmental impact in our buildings, our buses, and the education of our students and staff. It will be to coordinate with the county, which has just approved its climate action plan, And Ms. Snoddy has already reached out to Gabe Daly, who is the point person for compliance to the county's environmental plan. And he's willing to work, be a member of the committee. And we would also have a commitment to work with more broadly with regional partners such as UVA, as it turns out UVA the sustainability specialist at UVA, without prompting, reached out to me this week to talk about, to advise about a conference that I went to, webinar, on net zero schools.

I mean, I'll just throw out Lindsay had this great idea, which the ACES committee, the ACES will hopefully be able to evaluate and see if it's good or not. But she said, you know, we definitely have teachers that are passionate about the environment in each of our schools. And for example, we have composting. I know we've got a presentation on composting, but there's not always high compliance with composting. It really takes, she said, a teacher who's willing to stand there, especially in the beginning of the school year for a few weeks and kind of teach students How do you separate your stuff so that it can be composted correctly? And she was saying, which I think is neat, we should look at if we can do a bonus, just like we offer for coaches or people who are taking on extra things. It would give our teachers a chance to take ownership over something and increase their money and their salary and get to do something that they're probably passionate about anyway.

      "katrinacallsen: Thank you, Mr. Page. I'm going to start by reading the public comment guidelines. The school board invites and actively seeks the public's input in the matters relevant to school board governance and provides for time during its business meetings to hear from Albemarle County residents and community members. As authorized by ordinance of the County of Albemarle, the school board will hold its meetings electronically during the COVID-19 pandemic. The school board is, nevertheless, committed to encouraging public comment despite meeting on a virtual basis. For this reason, there will be two ways for the public to provide comment. First, as always, written comments may be submitted to the school board clerk prior to the start of the meeting and will be given to all the school board members for review. And as long as the school board member holds its meetings electronically, members of the public wishing to provide public comment during the meeting may sign up online by 2 p.m. the day of the meeting. Before electronic public comment starts, I'm going to announce the order in which the speakers are going to comment. Each speaker's access to public comment will be activated when it's your turn. Speakers will be notified when they reach the two-minute mark and at the three-minute mark. And that's usually just me holding up one finger when you have one minute left. Speakers during the meeting are those submitting written comments should state their name and address our magisterial district and further speaker should limit comments or try to limit comments to those matters that are relevant to school board governance or the operation of the school division. Lastly, although the school board will not respond to comments made during the public comment period, school board members may address comments at the end of the meeting agenda under other business. With that, let me pull up the public comment list. We have four speakers today. The first is going to be Margaret Lowry-Keppel. The second is going to be Michelle Drago. The third is going to be Amy Gertner. And the fourth is going to be Kenneth Martin. Ms. Keppel, if you are on, it is your turn.<|eot_id|>\n",

And I think we're going to be fighting, it's going to be challenging since we have some sort of gold standard Mesa Academy to sort of open it up and even the playing field. But aside from that, I would, one of the concerns I've had, and I've talked with Jeff about this a few times and Matt, is having people being able to move in and out of academies or having not had. I mean, right now you have to decide when you're in eighth grade to go to Mesa when it doesn't make sense since our whole first year is supposed to be the freshman seminar trying to decide what you want to do. So I would hope there would be different pathways between or into these academies. Or you could take business and some math and engineering an academy sort of create your own academy.<|eot_id|>\n",

And it allows you to pick and choose courses to meet it. There's an arts and letters as well. And remember, Kate, one of the one of the this was something that you had pushed for. And I think we all completely agree with it. is that the students wouldn't decide on going into one of these, we call them academies, they're really pathways. Academy sounds flashier, I guess, but they wouldn't decide to do that until after their ninth grade year. So that's already a change that's been put into place in the model because that way a ninth grader, they can do the freshman seminar, they can get well-established at high school, They have their legs under them, and they really have enough experience to say hey I think I just want to try this next year.

So I just, I wanted to put it to the board to talk a bit, to clarify a bit about what our intention is with that policy in terms of keeping our kids and staff safest. For me, the new guidelines from the CDC designating 15 minutes of contact over a 24-hour period that came out yesterday or the day before, was it yesterday? It just makes me concerned about this idea of respite, as well as the comments, you know, talking about expectations of teachers to set it specifically.

One, current COVID-19 conditions in the Albemarle County region and within the Albemarle County public schools, including but not limited to community transmission, testing positivity rates, applicable state and local school dashboards that may inform school reopening and operating plans, and other public health data. Two, guidance offered by the CDC and the state and local health authorities. Three, applicable executive orders and local ordinances that may impact the ability to provide successful classroom learning. Four, the status of COVID-19 testing and tracking capabilities in Albemarle County region. Five, ability of the Albemarle County Public Schools, including the availability of sufficient staffing and other resources to implement the school division's instructional and health plans. And six, the feedback and input from stakeholders and school communities. I further move that following the first marking period, the superintendent shall make a recommendation to the school board at the halfway point of each remaining marking period in the school year as to the stage that should be implemented for the next succeeding marking period. And I further move that the superintendent may, at any time, return the Albemarle County Public Schools to a prior stage as re-evaluation of the factors enumerated above, or that I stated before, may warrant, and in this event, shall so advise the school board at its next meeting following such action.<|eot_id|>\n",

You know, I think that, We don't want to deprive our kids who could benefit from stage two from at least nine weeks of instruction provided in the manner in which they need to receive it. I mean, that doesn't need to happen. If we move, as Dr. Haas was saying, if we open in stage two, he can move immediately to stage one if we need to. but we can't turn the other direction and go up the scale, meaning in larger numbers stages without at least four and a half weeks worth of notice. But the one thing that really does it for me on stage two is it doesn't include mandatory attendance. And that's a big issue as regards to the students and the parents. and the teachers all knowing that they can opt out in stage two if they absolutely need to. And this is the primary difference in my mind between stages one and stage two. It was an interesting thing that I got curious as to how many years of experience went into the making of this plan. And so I learned that the work of Dr. Haas, his cabinet, as well as the principals and directors throughout the school division, their cumulative years of experience within Albemarle County Public Schools is 1,418 years. And about 300 less fewer years of that are in administration. So there's a lot of experience that went into the decision making. And these are people who have the best interest of our students, our teachers, our staff members, and all of these people's families in the fronts of their minds at all times. I will vote for stage two. And that being said, I know that this isn't an easy one for any of our board members. It certainly wasn't for me.

Not a single board member has sat back and gone without questioning and asking very critical questions on behalf of the well-being of our students and employees and their families.

And even though the year before, we decided we would do it all toward the end of the year. So that's a mismatch, I think, in this cycle, that a board's work begins really each year in January.

And we've had the bi-weekly COVID reports and the transportation issues and the space issues, but we've still managed to keep our eye on our development of a final strategic plan. of the strategic plan is focused on addressing in concrete ways the achievement gap and centerpiece of that plan is a reaffirmation of our anti-racism policy. And we did this in a very turbulent time. So I'm very pleased that we were able to do that. I mean, something that's really not on the sheet is I think our adaptability in terms of changing information, and I know it's been confusing to many people in the community, and notwithstanding some of the comments, we all do read a lot and study the issues. And we are here to use our best judgment, weighing the benefits for almost 14,000 students and our 2,500 staff. And a given parent might not weigh it in exactly the same way. We hear that frequently.

And so even though at times we may not agree on everything. Still, we aren't, we don't become disagreeable, we are still united as a board. And then also my second main takeaway is our ability doing these last 12 months at least to make some really tough decisions under really, really difficult circumstances and to try to move forward with, again, the best interests of our students in mind. So those were my two main takeaways from this year.\n",

One thing that I really come to appreciate about our board, and I think it's really been evident in the past year and a half because we've been in the circumstance we've been in, is that we all come with a very unique perspective. And I think that we are true to those perspectives in a way that is collaborative. I think that the way that our meetings have been structured has given us all the opportunity to really air those perspectives and take others in and think about them. And I think that we've been really thoughtful about that. And I appreciate that. And then on Kate's point, our strategic plan is really unapologetic. And I think that we're united behind it.

I guess the takeaway for me is although I'm very proud of the work we did in the strategic plan and the urgency that we have expressed to Dr. Haas and the cabinet about learning losses, we now have learning losses conflated with achievement gap and I want us to not wait until the end of the year to see how we did. I mean, I really do want us to have a quicker feedback loop in terms of the progress, substantively what's being done, what needs to be done. Is there anything else the school board can do? I know they're doing early assessments this fall to look at learning loss, but we need to pay very close attention to what that looks like. Thank you.

      "katrinacallsen: I can chime in, please. But I would agree with John on, I guess I would categorize it broadly as public engagement. It's been something that's been particularly difficult this last year because of covid. I know that I haven't been to as many schools or events as I would normally get to. It's been difficult. In the beginning, Zoom made it seem like it was actually easier because you got to kind of pop into things. But I would look forward to in the next year figuring out ways that we could have more engagement with people. Focus on the achievement was my biggest one. And I am basing that on the rubric. The rubric for the evaluation is how to have high performing success and student achievement for all students. And that's one that I think we scored in total fairly low, so just having it as a consistent point of our agenda items and meetings and a focus on the data and metrics and agenda. So at a majority of its meetings, the school board considers agenda items specifically related to advancing student achievement. I think we could work on that, which brings me to my third point, which is something I have heard feedback from various members. And it's something I think we've struggled with for a while is just agenda development and getting sessions and work sessions and items that were passionate about and that we want to hear about. And I know we're doing some work with that. I know Jono and Judy have been meeting to try to get through some work sessions, but we've done various things in the past where we've tried to brainstorm. And I think it's just, there's some lack of clarity around like really what we're doing and how it's done. So those are my three items. Thank you.<|eot_id|>\n",

The Long Range Planning Advisory Committee has requested that the school board develop and approve a policy to provide direction on the goals for school sizes to help them guide their planning for the future. Our goal in planning this work session for you is to provide a context for school size in ACPS and for you to talk about your thinking on school size as a board. From your conversation and the ensuing notes, I suggest that Ms. Schmidt, Ms. Kumazawa, and I work with Dr. Acuff and Mr. Alcaro, who are our board's capital committee representatives, to draft verbiage for goals for desired school sizes for ACPS for future planning. We will bring the draft to the board for feedback and eventual approval. Once approved, the verbiage would be embedded in policy FB, facilities planning. Policies are reviewed every five years, as you all know, and so the board will have future opportunities to review and make sure these goals make sense. The purpose of the school board's discussion tonight is to consider the efficacy of expanding and or constructing school buildings and making future plans. It is not intended to be a way to close existing schools. And so with that, I'm going to turn things over to our Director of Budget and Planning, Maya Kumizawa.<|eot_id|>\n",

So we are sharpening the pencil and just being very creative in all of our transportation pieces of it to give instruction as many opportunities to develop a viable schedule. So it's one of those non-answers right now. We are working on it. We do know that we will be able to deliver students safely and it will be a layering of mitigation strategies, both from seating kids one per seat, considering the use of mask, ventilation, what's the best way to ventilate a bus.

And those might be of, you know, our teachers our own students.

Obviously, just like the need to communicate very clearly with the parents about their students' return to school, we will need to do the same with the staff as well and make sure that we've got things very much laid out for them. the idea of having something in a concise place where they can go and look for answers is gonna be very important. And so this is the beginning of the communication around that. And just so you know, the press release from yesterday was also shared with all staff members through the compass, which is our mechanism for communicating with all of our staff members. Claire, if I may, it's great to have a handbook or a single source where people can look, but I would encourage from a public health communications perspective to also have posters and reminders everywhere in the schools and the bathrooms, on the buses, because people do forget, especially.

There will be an uptick with having that number of students coming back and also all the staff that are associated with them and all the various people that are in support roles at UVA. My sense from what I've been taking away from the Virginia Department of Education weekly meetings that we've had is right now the plan from the governor's office is to say, you know, at some point we're going to be in phase three and we don't have a phase four. It's phase three and then it's every man for yourself. And, um, so school systems are going to be trying to figure this out. Uh, the, the role of the, of, of the governor's office in closing all the school systems in Virginia, I, I don't know how this sounds, but it wasn't about schools. It was about flattening the infection curve so that hospitals had time to catch up on the cases during a scenario where the federal government was lacking in terms of providing testing and all the other things that we needed. So it was not about schools. It was about flattening the curve for Virginia. I think there's a lot of celebrating going on right now that the curve got flattened. And so it's like, OK, so now you're going back to school, make up your plan. Our plans are not going to be approved by the Virginia Department of Education. They're going to be read. And they're going to provide feedback to us if they feel like there's some aspect of the plan that we haven't covered. So it's going to be, you talk about challenges. There's certainly all the technical challenges and all the pieces. I think our staff has done an outstanding job of addressing. Then there's just going to be the part about the community in a situation, again, very similar to where we were in March, where there will be infections, there will be issues presented with that. How will we move forward? And I think our best bet is to continue to work very closely with the Thomas Jefferson Health District and work with them to do what's best for our students, our staff, and our families. So that's kind of my overarching look at it is that we're now We're now holding the ball. Every school system in Virginia, all 133 of us are going our ways, and we're going to try to figure it out. That's kind of how the VDOE works in terms of how they do things.<|eot_id|>\n",

      "judyle: Um, firstly, I do, uh, want to say like, I really obviously hope that Dr. King gets well soon, um, and is able to join us. And I, I understand this difference in our agenda today, but I do want to register my frustration that what was a two hour discussion was changed to two and a half minutes with just 10 minutes of notice. Um, and it really goes to a feeling that I have about our meetings in general, in which we are often surprised with detailed information, uh, that I personally would like more time to process, um, and give thoughtful feedback on, um, so, and I know that we will discuss our meetings in PD at some point, so I'll have comments then. Secondly, um, Where I am right now, I really urge us as a board to not look at our county as somehow immune to nationwide issues. I've gotten that feedback from a couple of folks and I recognize that we prioritize being an anti racist division and I applaud us for that. But we do still have the same stubborn outcome gaps as do other divisions. And as you saw also on the data that I sent last night, we still have the same types of issues with placing police where there are more lock and bound students. The daily progress has reported, um, that we have the same types of disproportionate minority contact and Elmore County as do other municipalities. So I really urge us not to disregard nationwide research as something that we think just doesn't apply to us. Um, thirdly, I really appreciate the speed with which the staff has been able to bring together. a review, but I again caution us on mistaking a lack of problems in a survey over the summer to meaning a lack of issues. And Mr. Oberg mentioned this before. So I'm also curious, because I did not catch this yesterday about how this stopped being an independent review. It still feels like we're looking from the inside.

Jono and I attended a educational law conference four years ago, about the same time there were some Department of Justice and other reports about disturbing reports about how SROs were implementing discipline and perhaps a disproportionate application of that discipline to some of our minority students. I did meet and Jono and I met but I met also with Matt and multiple members of our Staff to look at what our MOU looked like and I have to say it is It didn't look very good to me four years ago. It was not very specific about what we wanted to accomplish Having said that we've gone now to superintendents to police chiefs to lawyers. We have a very good SRO contract, but that does not, or draft MOU, that doesn't answer the foundational question of whether the SRO or what roles. I think it's very easy to get caught up in the visible presence of the police in the schools. And I'm concerned with that as well. encroaching in the areas of discipline, but there are layers of connectivity between the schools and the police department that are not, don't require that. And I would just have us look thoughtfully at how we address those various levels of function. Just to be clear, you still had 20 seconds. Oh, you were waving at me like, oh, wait a minute. That's good. No, it's good. I look forward to the data, as imperfect as it may be, so we can make a better informed decision about how we address the various functions.<|eot_id|>\n",

In fact, if you would prefer to not do any of this, again, as you can see from the report you received earlier, we've got a lot of things that we're working on right now.

It might be true that what we are seeing within the county would be the same as we are seeing everywhere else.

      "kateacuff: I'd be happy to. Chairman Alcaro. I sent a memo to all of you on the school board. And as you know, we entered a wonderful partnership with the Boys and Girls Club about a year and a half ago for them to build a 30,000 square foot facility on the Lambs Lane campus. Because of a variety of reasons, they ended up taking a much less favorable location to build that on. And since that time, they have shared that the building costs are about $3.5 million more than they had originally contemplated. In addition, they went to the Board of Supervisors to get some help in covering that shortfall. And recently, the Board of Supervisors said no, that given the revenue stream and budget constraints, they could not do so. So here today, in addition, there are many other advantages to building on the preferred site, which was on the driver's course. in addition to disturbing less natural area, better drainage and a variety of things. But I would like us I would like to make a motion that we authorize our attorney, Ross Holden, to work with the Boys and Girls Club to move the site to their preferred location, which is currently on our driver's range. and come back to us either on the 9th or at least by the 16th, understanding that everybody is in tight time constraints.<|eot_id|>\n",

It's safer for the students to walk there. It's killing, that's probably not, catching two birds with one stone, because we've had a lot of community input about what the LAMS area campus looks like. And I don't know if you guys have driven by the driver's range, but it is It's got barbed wire around about half of it. I'm not sure what function that serves. And it's a little bit of an eyesore right now. Also, we were presented with a lot of data around the safety records. I know that was Steve Colazar's big concern with the driving range. And the data has shown that students that learn to drive in a parking lot with cones, that learn to drive on roads, have the same safety records. It's just as effective as using a driving range. It's better for the environment. It saves the county money. It's the way to go, and I'm happy that we're revisiting it.\n",

      "kateacuff: Well, I, I would support that, but if you recall our process, it, The drivers range was always the first choice, both of Roslyn Schmidt and the Boys and Girls Club, and in the end, after lengthy. We had a program evaluation done of the drivers and program which found no difference, no, no. advantage to having the driver's course over what we have at the other schools. We still didn't act. We instead did an RFP that delayed the process by four more months, at which time the Boys and Girls Club was concerned about retaining its funders. So they proposed reluctantly the secondary choice. I don't know if those of you who have not walked that site behind Jack Jewett, it's a sloping ditch. It's a terrible location. It can physically happen. But as you can see from the list of water drainage and clearing out hiking trails and clearing out woods. It is a much less good sign. They had hoped until the past six weeks that they could get some of that shortfall in funding from the Board of Supervisors. The Board of Supervisors historically has chipped in in certain kinds of communities. benefit projects, like the new senior center made a small contribution to that. So there was precedence for that. But they were told unambiguously a couple of weeks ago that they would not get any money, in fact, which is unfortunate, the timetable. But that is what the timetable was. I This is in my district. I'm, of course, particularly concerned with re-envisioning that whole campus. But I think without denigrating in any way the passion of the driver's ed staff, I think that our program evaluation showed it is the quality of the staffing and the program and not specifically that driver's range. that makes the Albemarle County Public School Drivers Ed Program exemplary in the state. And, you know, kudos to them. And it's one of those awful situations where you have to choose between two goods. And I choose generally a good that will touch more students. And we have three to five hundred students per year that will be touched by the Boys and Girls Club. And I don't want to have another year of fundraising delay before they break ground.<|eot_id|>\n",

If you can only do one, I think that anybody outside of our school system looking at this decision making process would say, what in the world? Why did you hold on to that antiquated barbed wire fence? facility when you could have had a Boys and Girls Club facility on that spot for your children.\n",

      "katrinacallsen: I'll chime in real quick, although I guess I've already spoken a little bit. I like that the resolution anticipates that we might be implementing just a different kind of school security. It says different school security initiative because I think parents hear that we want to get rid of police or decrease daily presence of police and think that we're not going to be adequately making sure that schools are secure. And that's just not true. There's lots of ways that you can have security in schools. I think Albemarle has even done, when I toured Albemarle, when Jesse was still the principal, someone mentioned that they had different securities, like he had higher security there. I'd reached out to some old colleagues of mine who are administrators now. One of them in Atlanta says they do use SROs. They don't keep them. in the schools, they have a very clear delineated process for when they involve the police. So for like a weapons, if it's a gun, if they find a gun, then they have the police officer involved from the initial stages. But otherwise, they have a very clear checklist that you have to go to before you get to the SRO. And in many cases, he said that SRO is not involved at all until at the very end of the police officer will contact the victim of the crime and see after they've done the behavioral therapist and all the other stuff, they'll contact the SROs and SRO will contact the victim to see if they want to press charges. So I'm just saying that there's, I don't want the, I like that we have that in there. And that's what the kind of thing I would like to see from the school system is not, we're not going to have this discipline. We're not, we don't care about student safety. It's that we don't, this can be done differently. And in a way that is, in a way that is effective. That was a lot of talking. I hope that made sense.\n",

So we do have time to do a good job looking at all the background information and give the staff some time to pull together what resources or options we may want to make decisions on. And secondly, having a later date would permit Nick King who directs that program to participate. And I think just that would be good to be able to question him and get his input on it as well. And just take notice that We have received a lot of letters on both sides and a significant subset were in favor of keeping the SROs. So I think we need to do, I like the, I thought, and I may well be wrong, but that we had directed, had a resolution motion last time to direct the superintendent and staff to look at the SRO program and consider options. but not outright getting rid of it as of last meeting.

The statute that requires a superintendent to make a funding request is not specific that it's limited to operating costs, and in fact, many other school divisions include both in the funding request. And I think that we ought to be in that category, that a way to elevate our capital needs, both to the supervisors, but even more so to the community is to include the needs of our capital. You've all heard me speak with some alarm that we now have about 100 classrooms in trailers. We have a very aging infrastructure.

And one of the questions I guess I have for staff, and I don't know if Ms. Lee joins me or not, is when two or three years ago we eliminated fees for academic programs, do we have anything in place regarding the cost of AP courses or materials? And I don't have to have the answer tonight, but that was one question that was raised. And I think we don't. And I just would just like some feedback on that at some point.<|eot_id|>\n",

      "patrickmclau: Hi, good evening board members. I'm Pat McLaughlin, chief of strategic planning for the division, and I'm here tonight with Eileen Gomez to provide our COVID-19 status update. As the board knows, we follow a five-step process that is recommended by the Virginia Department of Health and the Virginia Department of Education for guidelines on reopening our schools. And one of the things the board has asked us to report on every meeting is the level of community transmission. Before we get into our slides, I do want to point out a bit of an anomaly that's taken place with the data in the last couple of days, as Eileen, who follows us so closely, pointed out that yesterday the numbers started doing some really strange things. For example, we had 65 cases reported in Albemarle County, which we haven't seen for months. And City of Charlottesville had negative 35 cases reported on their dashboard. And so Eileen reached out to the health department and what she was able to find out was that there was a backlog of a number of cases that the health department has recently started to input. Cases are reported on the day they're entered into the system, not the day that testing takes place. So what we did to make sure our data was really the most accurate we could is our latest data is reported from Tuesday the 20th of this week. So you'll see a little bit of a change in the date. We usually report the data from the current day. But those numbers are really throwing things off a bit. So we're going to work with the health department and make sure we're reconciling that. So when you see some asterisks tonight on the following slides, that's why. So I'll turn things over to Eileen.<|eot_id|>\n",

I guess I'm worried about how principles kind of what Kate was saying how different principles are using their funding and whether or not it's creating disparities between our schools and it's you know. yeah I guess that that would be it. And what other models might might speak to that or be able to. I don't know so that depends on the engine but that's what i'm interested in are there inequities like when I asked us kind of follow up questions at school specific like what is this school doing versus this school and and is it okay that we're.

I would not be able to craft it right now, probably very eloquently off the top of my head, but something speaking to in our own system, are we realizing inequities based on how staff is choosing to use their funding within our own school system? Matt, would you have a better way to say it? I feel like you have done some thinking on this. Thank you. So what I'm hearing is an interest in finding out, or at least this is a question that comes to my mind, is how is autonomy or, you know, we've often said we're a site-based managed school system. And to what degree is autonomy hindering our progress? And is there a correlation in the school systems that we might study between the amount of central authority over the way staffing is allocated at the school and their success with closing achievement gaps?\n",

And we have enormous differences across our schools in our demographics as well. And in In light of our commitment to evaluate all of our policies with the equity lens, I was just wondering, perhaps that will get to it. But as far as I understand, the primary variable in determining this is income only. But we have a lot of other data about our students. And maybe we should factor that in.

So, uh, there are any other views on that? Any other thoughts on that second question? Well, what I'm interested in, are we deploying our resources in the most efficient and impactful way to address equity in our schools? And that's sort of our overarching mission. So are we spending enough? Are we spending too much? Are we not spending it in the right places? I don't know the answers.\n",

So I'm going to be standing in for her this evening. We would also like direction around the compensation adopted market. I know many of you are familiar with the current market we have. It was adopted back in 2000. The market is 26 school divisions and we initially had a target to be at the median or the 50th percentile. So back in 2005, that target was changed to be at the top quartile or the 75th percent. And then in 2017, we took another look at the market and our methodology along with Titan Gallagher, a consultant. That resulted in the change in the way that we develop our scale and use the two anchor point. But we know that a motion was made and I'll read it for you. After this budget season and prior to the next budget season, Staff do an evaluation of the current market basket methodology. So our question is very broad. We would really like to know what compensation objective you would like to accomplish with this review of our market, beginning with the end in mind. So I'll open it up to you all so that we can get that direction.<|eot_id|>\n",

When we have our steering team meetings with local government, we made them aware that we were going to be really looking hard at our market because of the discoveries that we had around being behind the city and the other local school divisions really catching up on us. And so before we brought this to you tonight, I did call the county executive and let let his let him know that we were going to be doing a four percent compensation increase for our classified staff. And I gave him the rationale for it, that we had we had studied our market and that we found that other school systems that we compete with are of doing what I think we should do, which is they couple their licensed staff pay raises with their classified staff. They do not couple it with their local government. They treat all the employees in their school systems the same. We're not doing five and five this year. However, I think having the $15 minimum really accomplishes a lot that's equivalent to going after 5%, especially at the lower paid position. So I did talk to Mr. Richardson about that. I think it really helps that in addition to everything else, we do have a balanced budget. So we're not saying we're going to double what the county is proposing to do and we want more funding to go with it. So I think we've done it within the constraints that we have.

And there were three, and in two of them, the parents were crying. You know, they were so emotional about how their child, who could speak English in one case where they couldn't, was talking to them so well, and they were just overcome. We were talking in terms of the overall, we liked how the structure was laid out in terms of the what for the program. We appreciated the SEL component and thought that was so important, especially right now. In terms of wants, we had a few of these, and I don't think we got through all of them, but the difference between the relationship between SEL and mental and physical wellness. We want to get that expanded on. When will the, what you were talking about, Jen, be ready to go and in terms of will the assessment start before the end of the school year? Will they start after the end of the school year? When will they be, how long will it take to get it analyzed?

And it is just wonderful to see the kids back in there. And in middle schools, I asked a number of students But how it is to be back, and everybody was, yeah, great, great, great. And I asked, pointing at my mask, how about this? And all but one person, and she just didn't say anything, said, you know, it's so good to be back. This is a small price to pay. And so we're totally good for you.\n",

And all of the principals in each of the schools I was in said that everybody's cooperating. The only thing they have to really deal with with masks is when it slips down below the nose. Just remind them and up it goes. And so, and it's just great. I did promise Scottsville Elementary that I would give a wave to them tonight. Hi, Scottsville. And that's all I got. OK.\n",

All right, I did go to an Earth Day sort of event in a way at Monticello High School, we remember probably about two years ago, Mr Stanek brought us some honey from the bees that he had at Monticello. Unfortunately, some of that, the hive, I think, died out. So there'll be no honey this year, but Ms. Binder and Mr. Stanek were sort of setting up new bee colonies, or at least trying to entice bees to come into the area to lay eggs and sort of produce new hives. So being there for Earth Day was really a nice occasion at Monticello.<|eot_id|>\n",

      "patrickmclau: Thanks, Eileen. And as you recall, also the CDC has given us a couple of other ways to look at this in terms of our core indicators. One is that they have a core indicator of the total cumulative cases in Albemarle County over the past seven days. and that they update this data now once a week, and the data is from the previous Saturday each week. So as of March 27th, our cumulative caseload in the county was 91.98, which is in the substantial range, and our percent positivity for the past seven days was 1.4, which was in the lowest range. When these two numbers aren't in the same range, the CDC recommends following the guidance for the higher of the two ranges. As you can see, we have come down for the past three weeks from the high range into the substantial range and appear to be holding pretty steady at that lower level. If you remember also that we take the level of community transmission and couple that with the level of school impact, which we are rating at low, we have zero or sporadic cases. We have sporadic cases of COVID in our schools with no evidence of in-school transmission. Our student absenteeism is at a low level and staff capacity is normal. And they also ask us to take a look at a chart that puts these two things together. So when we have our community transmission rate at the orange level, which is substantial, and a low impact to schools, that puts us in this top right quadrant in terms of where we should be with our schools. And in the main take away from that is that we should be open for in-person instruction to the maximum extent possible, ensuring three to six feet of distance for our students and a minimum of six feet of distance for our middle and high school students. And so that we've been at that level for the past couple of times that we've talked with the board and Eileen and I would be happy to take any questions or comments from the board at this time.<|eot_id|>\n",

      "patrickmclau: Yes, thank you again Chairman Page, Pat McLaughlin, Chief of Strategic Planning for the School Division, and I'm here now to give you an update on the School Division calendar for the 2021-2022 school year. As you recall, at the meeting we had on March 11, staff brought forward a revised 21-22 school year calendar that sought to create dedicated time for professional learning community meetings next year. One of the silver linings that's been identified during the pandemic was the enhanced ability for PLC meetings, both for our school-based PLC teams and for cross-divisional PLCs to meet remotely. To ensure that dedicated time, we proposed adding five half days to the school calendar next year. When coupled with existing professional development days that were already in the school calendar, that guaranteed one day per month of dedicated time for this work. Board feedback that night centered around the impact the additional half days would have on instructional time next year. And based on that feedback, we present the board with two calendar options for next year. Draft A, which is included in your board packet, is the same draft that you saw on March 11th with the additional half days. Draft B in your board packet adds two additional instructional days to the calendar to account for the instructional time lost on the half days. In draft B, the school year would be 182 instructional days as opposed to 180 and would begin on Monday, August 23rd instead of Wednesday, August 25th. So we're hoping tonight that the board will take action on one of these calendars, and I'm happy to take any questions that you may have that will help you with your decision making.<|eot_id|>\n",

I was going to say something along those lines that I think from what some of our public commenters said about pushing it all to the summer or later, this is the point of the embedded PD days, which are the professional learning communities, which is part of the strategy to address learning loss and ongoing issues in a real-time basis.

And I think I'm all for that. But I'm also hopeful that there will be accountability as a part of that, especially since we're taking the time that, you know, time away from the students right there. So I was just wondering what accountability measures will have in place.\n",
      "matthewhaas: Absolutely. So, and I'm so glad you brought that up because that's that is a conversation we're having right now, pending the board approval. So one thing I would say is that It's scheduling them on Wednesdays is really it's not about it's it's it's about we know that on Mondays and Fridays that's when we have the most heavy leave usage by our employees that's people just tend to do that because they can you know they can just kind of line their ducks up in a row and. be at work for four days and then, you know, that's just what people do. So it's not that we don't think they'll be attentive or maybe won't get down to business. It's just Wednesday is a good day to do it. It's midweek and you can also make some quick adjustments and turn things around by Friday. So what we will do is on these days, because we have become really good at teleconferencing, is start out with a division-wide conversation among me and the elementary schools where we will kind of lay out the plan for the afternoon. We will talk about the work products that we want at the end of the session around data analysis, where their students are and what their plans are moving forward so that we can be impactful. And then we'll do the same thing with the secondary schools. We'll start out tight. at the division level, and then they'll roll out into school meetings and then into grade level and subject area meetings. But there will be a product focus. They will be required to develop plans for students who need extra time and support, and also to make adjustments in their pacing and curriculum so that they can stay on track. So that's typically how the successful schools that do professional learning community well have a product focus requirement, not just taking minutes about what they talked about that day, but what did they produce that's going to move students forward.<|eot_id|>\n",

They were students are so they just don't have the trappings of adults, they don't know what they don't know they were so thrilled to find out the history of Virginia Murray. I think it was news to many of them that the school opened in 1960 is an all black school. That was incredibly meaningful to them and their process. They learned about the school history of black schools, predominantly in Albemarle County. They have already gotten to interview Roosevelt Barber, so they just peppered him with some amazing questions. I think they got so much out of this process. Learned so much, shared so much, each student took what they were learning back to their homeroom and shared it with all the other students in the classroom. That was really meaningful for the students to get this tangible experience with the history. And they're so excited to continue. One other thing that the student committee did for us is they helped with the survey process.\n",

      "mayakumaza: Good evening. I'm Maya Kumazawa, Director of Planning and Budget. And as Mr. Zimmerman mentioned, since we are on the topic of the CIP, I have just a couple of slides tonight to provide you with an update on the Crozet expansion project. As a reminder, this project includes an addition of approximately 35,000 square feet by adding classrooms, support spaces, and an expanded kitchen, cafeteria, and media center. We also plan on replacing the HVAC system as well as making other improvements to the existing building and outdoor areas. The design for this project began more than one year ago. And in December, the school board approved an appropriation of $20.4 million in construction funds to move forward with the project. We've recently received bids to construct this expansion and we're excited to begin the work next month to stay on our schedule for opening, for the 22-23 school year. The update that I'd like to provide is that based on the information that we have so far, we're looking to appropriate an additional $1 million for this project. We had been holding this additional funding in reserve, not fully knowing how the bids would come in. We've seen that costs have increased during the pandemic, resulting in higher than originally anticipated bids. And we'd also like to move forward with additive bid items that are listed on the slide. So in summary, we will be requesting that the board of supervisors appropriate an additional $1 million for this project that will be moved from within CIP funds. And with that, I'll turn it back to Mr. Zimmerman.<|eot_id|>\n",

       "\" Thank you, Chair Page. Last month, we had the wonderful opportunity to hear from Baker Butler educators about the nationally recognized gains they have made in closing the achievement gap at their school. Tonight we're focusing on yet another opportunity gap in our schools and in schools across our nation, the percentage of students of color who enter STEM related fields. 45 years ago, an organization was established to address this issue, the National Society of Black Engineers. Its mission was ambitious and vital to the collective prosperity of every community in the United States. The society was organized to promote academic excellence, provide scholarships, train leaders, and expand access to professional careers. A few years ago, the society broadened its charter to include high school chapters, and one of the first chapters in Central Virginia was established at Albemarle High School. Membership is open to students from all of our middle school and high schools, regardless of race or ethnicity. Students from Greer, Burley, and soon Walton are members and students are members, and students from UVA serve as mentors. There currently are 25 students in our local chapter, and more than 100 students have had their lives changed by this extraordinary program. Many have gone on to earn engineering degrees at the university level. The driving, guiding, determined light for these young people continues to be Ms. Pearl Early, Albemarle High School student support specialist. A characteristic of this program is its strong emphasis on project-based learning. Students learn how to research, design, experiment with, and refine solutions that can improve our lives. A natural topic this year is COVID-19, and true to form, students have come up with an ingenious approach to protecting public health. I understand that the nature of this development process is that it can take up to two years, but our students have field-tested their invention within seven months. I'd like to ask Ms. Early to tell us a little more about the journey of her students over these past seven years, and to introduce us to today's superstars who will tell us about their new discovery. Ms. Early?\""
